# Write a theory lesson

Write a short theory lesson that introduces one or two key concepts to a beginner. The lesson should be factual, direct, and based on consistent examples from movie recommendations. It should be written in a tone that is casual, friendly, and succinct. Avoid filler language or motivational fluff. Stick to useful, clear information.  Focus on where the content and subject will be useful for a developer or data scientist in their day to day lives.

## Constraints

- Keep the lesson under 5 minutes to read.
- Only introduce 1â€“2 new concepts per lesson.
- Use simple language, assume no prior knowledge.
- All examples must relate to movie recommendation systems.
- Use a consistent business-world analogy appropriate for developers or data scientists.
- Do not mix metaphors or use unrelated analogies.
- Do not include hands-on steps or exercises in this lesson.
- Break up content by level 2 and level 3 headings.
- You are describing something, not selling it.  Stick to facts, avoid hyperoble.  Only include information that is relevant.

## Required Structure

### 1. Introduction

- One sentence recapping what has been learned previously where applicable.
- One short paragraph explaining why this concept is relevant in the context of the course or previous lesson, using a business scenario from movie recommendations.

### 2. Prior Knowledge

- If applicable, briefly mention what was covered in the previous lesson in one sentence.

### 3. Concept(s)

For each concept:

- Provide a clear, plain-language definition.
- Use a consistent analogy from business, relevant to a developer or data scientist.
- Give a concrete example from movie recommendations.
- Include a sentence that someone might say aloud to explain the concept informally.
- (Optional) Include a short description of a supporting visual.

### 4. Practical Context

- One sentence applying how the concept or concepts fit into a larger system, product, or workflow.

### 5. Teaser

- One sentence describing what the learner will do or build in the next lesson, phrased as a challenge.

## Instruction

Write the final lesson content directly. Do not include bullet points, notes, or meta-commentary. This is the learner-facing copy.
