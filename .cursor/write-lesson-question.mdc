# Write Lesson Questions

Write effective multiple-choice questions that test learner comprehension of key concepts from GraphAcademy lessons. Questions should be clear, concise, and pedagogically sound, with plausible distractors and helpful hints and solutions.

## Key Principles

**Write targeted, specific questions**
- Avoid ambiguous questions that could have multiple interpretations
- Use concrete scenarios with specific details (times, values, situations)
- Test specific facts and concepts explicitly taught in the lesson
- Focus on practical application rather than abstract theory

**Write direct, conversational solutions**
- NEVER use phrases like "According to the lesson" or "As mentioned in the lesson"
- State explanations directly and concisely
- Write as if explaining to a colleague, not referencing course material
- Keep explanations focused and remove unnecessary preamble

## Constraints

- Questions must be stored in a `questions/` subfolder within the lesson directory
- Each question must be in its own `.adoc` file with a descriptive name (e.g., `1-log-types.adoc`)
- Use AsciiDoc format exclusively
- Questions must test concepts explicitly taught in the lesson
- All answers must be definitively correct or incorrect based on lesson content
- Provide 4 options total: either 2 correct + 2 incorrect, or 1 correct + 3 incorrect
- Keep question text concise and unambiguous
- Make distractors plausible but clearly wrong to learners who understood the material
- Always include hint and solution sections

## Required File Structure

### File Organization:
```
lesson-directory/
├── lesson.adoc
└── questions/
    ├── 1-descriptive-name.adoc
    ├── 2-another-question.adoc
    └── ...
```

### Question File Format:
```asciidoc
[.question]
= Question Title

Question text goes here?

* [x] Correct answer
* [x] Another correct answer (if applicable)
* [ ] Incorrect answer
* [ ] Another incorrect answer

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Helpful guidance without giving away the answer.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Explanation of correct answers with context from the lesson.
====
```

### Include in Lesson File:
```asciidoc
[.quiz]
== Check your understanding

include::questions/1-descriptive-name.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::questions/2-another-question.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


read::Continue to next lesson[]
```

## Question Writing Guidelines

### 1. Question Title
- Use a concise, descriptive heading (e.g., `= Log Types`, `= Query Performance`)
- Omit numbering prefixes like "1." in the heading itself
- Make it searchable and meaningful

### 2. Question Text
- Write as a clear, direct question or instruction
- For multiple correct answers, add: "Select all that apply."
- For single correct answer, add: "Select the correct answer." (optional)
- Avoid ambiguous phrasing or trick questions
- Test understanding, not memorization of exact wording

### 3. Answer Options
- Use `[x]` for correct answers, `[ ]` for incorrect answers
- Keep options parallel in structure, length, and grammatical form
- Order answers logically (not always alphabetically)
- Make all options grammatically consistent with the question stem
- Avoid "All of the above" or "None of the above" options

### 4. Creating Distractors (Incorrect Answers)
- Base distractors on common misconceptions
- Use related but incorrect concepts
- Make them plausible to learners who skimmed the material
- Avoid nonsensical or obviously wrong options
- Don't use "trick" wording or minor technicalities

### 5. Hint Section
- Provide gentle guidance toward the correct answer
- Reference relevant lesson section or concept
- Don't give away the answer directly
- Help learners think through the problem
- Keep it brief (1-2 sentences)

### 6. Solution Section
- Clearly state the correct answer(s) using bold text
- Explain WHY each answer is correct directly and concisely
- **NEVER use phrases like**: "According to the lesson", "As mentioned in the lesson", "The lesson states that"
- Write as if explaining the concept directly, not referencing source material
- Use bold text for key concepts: `**Query logs**`
- Keep explanations focused without unnecessary preamble
- Use line breaks between multiple correct answers: `+`

Good example (direct and concise):
```asciidoc
====
The correct answer is **Details view, because it shows individual query executions with timing and metadata**.

The Details view shows individual query executions with additional information including execution time, user, driver, and application. This view is useful when investigating specific issues at a particular time.
====
```

Bad example (references lesson, too wordy):
```asciidoc
====
According to the lesson, the correct answer is **Details view**. 

The lesson explains that the Details view shows individual query executions with additional information on a query-by-query basis, including the time it took to execute the query, the user who executed it, the driver that executed it, and the application that executed it. This view is useful when investigating specific issues, like what happened at a particular time.

The other options are incorrect because the lesson states that...
====
```

## Question Types and Examples

### Multiple Correct Answers (Select All That Apply):
Best for testing which items belong to a category or which statements are true.

Example:
```asciidoc
[.question]
= Log Types

Which of the following types of logs are available in Aura?

* [x] Query logs
* [x] Security logs
* [ ] Audit logs
* [ ] Performance logs
```

### Single Correct Answer:
Best for testing definitions, processes, or specific facts.

Example:
```asciidoc
[.question]
= Default Port

What is the default port for Neo4j Bolt protocol?

Select the correct answer.

* [ ] 7474
* [x] 7687
* [ ] 8080
* [ ] 9000
```

### Scenario-Based Questions:
Best for testing application of concepts. Use concrete details like specific times, values, or situations.

Good example (specific scenario with concrete details):
```asciidoc
[.question]
= Choosing the Right View

A user reported that their product search was slow yesterday at 2:30 PM. You want to see the exact queries that ran at that time, including which driver and user executed them. Which view should you use?

Select the correct answer.

* [ ] Summary view, because it shows aggregate statistics
* [x] Details view, because it shows individual query executions with timing and metadata
* [ ] Query timeline, because it shows spikes in activity
* [ ] Summary view sorted by Total time spent
```

Avoid vague scenarios (too general):
```asciidoc
[.question]
= Using Query Logs

You notice your application is responding slowly. What should you do?

* [ ] Check security logs
* [x] Use query logs
* [ ] Restart the database
* [ ] Contact support
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a question, verify:

**File Structure:**
- [ ] File created in `questions/` subfolder with descriptive name
- [ ] Included in lesson file with `leveloffset=+1`
- [ ] File naming follows pattern: `1-description.adoc`

**Question Format:**
- [ ] Starts with `[.question]` marker
- [ ] Has concise, descriptive heading
- [ ] Clear question text
- [ ] Appropriate instruction ("Select all that apply" or "Select the correct answer")
- [ ] 4 total options with correct `[x]` and `[ ]` markers

**Content Quality:**
- [ ] Tests key concept explicitly taught in the lesson
- [ ] All correct answers are definitively correct
- [ ] All incorrect answers are definitively incorrect
- [ ] Distractors are plausible but clearly wrong
- [ ] Options are parallel in structure and length
- [ ] No ambiguity in question or answers

**Required Sections:**
- [ ] Hint section with `[TIP,role=hint]` provides helpful guidance
- [ ] Solution section with `[TIP,role=solution]` explains correct answers
- [ ] Proper AsciiDoc spacing (two line breaks between sections)

**Technical Review:**
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Renders correctly in preview
- [ ] All bold formatting correct: `**text**`
- [ ] Line breaks in solution use ` +` correctly

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Questions too ambiguous/general**: Use concrete scenarios with specific details (times, values, situations), not vague situations
2. **Using "According to the lesson" in solutions**: Write explanations directly without referencing the lesson material
3. **Questions too easy/obvious**: Test understanding, not just recognition
4. **Distractors too silly**: Make them plausible but definitively wrong
5. **Testing trivia**: Focus on concepts that matter practically
6. **Hints too revealing**: Guide thinking, don't give the answer
7. **Solutions too wordy**: Be concise and direct, remove unnecessary preamble
8. **Inconsistent formatting**: Follow AsciiDoc conventions strictly
9. **Missing leveloffset**: Always use `[leveloffset=+1]` in include statements

## Instruction

When asked to create a question:
1. Read the lesson content to identify 1-2 key concepts to test
2. Create the `questions/` folder if it doesn't exist
3. Write the question file following the format exactly
4. Include it in the lesson file within the `[.quiz]` section
5. Verify no linter errors
6. Ensure the question tests understanding, not memorization
