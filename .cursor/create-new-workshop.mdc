# Create a New GraphAcademy Workshop

This guide walks you through creating a hands-on workshop by combining and adapting content from existing GraphAcademy courses. Workshops are focused, practical learning experiences that guide learners through a specific goal or project.

## What is a Workshop?

A **workshop** is a shorter, hands-on learning experience (typically 1-3 hours) that:

- Combines content from multiple existing courses
- Focuses on a specific practical goal or project
- Guides learners through accomplishing something concrete
- Adapts theory lessons to be more concise and action-oriented
- Emphasizes hands-on practice over comprehensive theory
- Includes **stretch goals** for extended learning

**Examples:**

- "Import the Northwind Dataset" - combines data modeling + importing + querying
- "Build a Recommendation Engine" - combines Cypher + GDS + application development
- "Set Up Production Monitoring" - combines Aura + metrics + alerting

## Technical Requirements for Workshop Content

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Follow these technical requirements for every workshop lesson. These are non-negotiable.**

### 1. Lead with Problems, Not Solutions

**⚠️ REQUIRED: Every workshop MUST start with an overview lesson.**

**DON'T** start workshops by introducing tools or technologies first.

**DO** start with a workshop overview lesson that explains what learners will build and why it matters.

**Required First Lesson Structure:**

The first lesson of every workshop must be an **overview lesson** that covers:

1. **The Challenge** - What problem are they solving? (e.g., "Working with connected data in relational databases requires complex JOINs")
2. **What You'll Build** - Concrete outcomes and deliverables (e.g., "A working graph database with customer, order, and product data")
3. **What You'll Learn** - The complete workflow and skills (e.g., "Model data → Import CSV → Query with Cypher")
4. **Why This Approach** - Benefits of the solution (e.g., "Graph databases are well-suited for connected data")
5. **Your Outcomes** - Clear success criteria

**Only after the overview** should you introduce tools and setup.

**Example - BAD:**
```
Lesson 1: What is Neo4j Aura?
Lesson 2: Create an Aura instance
Lesson 3: What is Data Importer?
```

**Example - GOOD:**
```
Lesson 1: Workshop Overview: Building Your First Graph Database (problem, outcomes, approach)
Lesson 2: Introduction to Neo4j Aura (introduces the platform)
Lesson 3: Create Your Aura Instance (hands-on setup challenge)
Lesson 4: Aura Tools Overview (tools they'll use)
```

**First Lesson Template:**
```asciidoc
= Workshop Overview: [What They'll Build]
:type: lesson
:order: 1

[.slide.discrete]
== Introduction

In this workshop, you will [transform/build/create] [specific outcome].

[.slide]
== The Challenge: [Problem Statement]

[Describe the problem they're solving]

[.slide]
== What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you will have built [concrete deliverable].

[.slide]
== What You'll Learn

[Module by module breakdown]

[.slide]
== Why [This Approach]?

[Benefits and rationale - factual, not sales language]

[.slide]
== Your Outcomes

By completing this workshop, you will:
* [Outcome 1]
* [Outcome 2]
* [Outcome 3]
```

### 2. Stay True to Source Material - No Hallucinations

**CRITICAL: Only include content that exists in the source courses you're adapting from.**

**DON'T:**
- Add concepts not covered in source courses
- Invent new technical terms or sections
- Add "advanced" topics that weren't in the original material
- Create content from general knowledge

**DO:**
- Read the entire source lesson before adapting
- Only include concepts present in source material
- Adapt examples to workshop context, but keep concepts the same
- If you think additional content is needed, note it for review rather than adding it

**Example of Hallucination to AVOID:**
- Source course doesn't mention "fanout" → Don't add a "Understanding Fanout" section
- Source course doesn't cover "denormalization strategies" → Don't add that concept
- Source course has 3 relationship types → Don't add 6 relationship types

### 3. Slide Formatting - Consistent and Unambiguous

**REQUIRED slide structure for EVERY lesson:**

```asciidoc
= Lesson Title
:type: lesson
:order: 1

[.slide.discrete]
== Introduction

Two-part opening (see review-lesson-content.mdc):
- Part 1: Context from previous lesson or why this matters
- Part 2: "In this lesson, you will learn..."


[.slide]
== Main Topic 1

Content for the main topic.


[.slide.discrete]
=== Subtopic 1.1

Details about the subtopic.


[.slide]
== Main Topic 2

Content for another main topic.


[.summary]
== Summary

Bullet points with **bold** concepts and forward reference to next lesson.

read::Mark as completed[]
```

**Rules:**
- Opening section: `[.slide.discrete]` with level-2 header `==`
- Main content sections: `[.slide]` with level-2 header `==`
- Subsections within main topics: `[.slide.discrete]` with level-3 header `===`
- Summary section: `[.summary]` with level-2 header `==`
- TWO blank lines between all sections
- NO sections without slide markers
- NO inconsistent marker usage

### 4. Code Blocks - Always Explain, Never Dump

**REQUIRED pattern for code examples:**

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Finding Customer Orders

To find orders for a specific customer, you need to traverse the PLACED relationship from the Customer node to Order nodes.


[source,cypher]
.Find all orders for a customer
----
MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: 'ALFKI'})-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)
RETURN c.companyName, o.orderId, o.orderDate
ORDER BY o.orderDate;
----

This query:

* Starts at a specific Customer node using the customerId property
* Follows the PLACED relationship to find connected Order nodes
* Returns the company name along with order details
* Sorts results by order date

Try running this query in your Query tool and observe the results.
```

**DON'T:**
- Show multiple code blocks in sequence without explanation
- Assume learners understand what code does
- Use code blocks as filler

**DO:**
- Explain the purpose BEFORE showing the code
- Add a descriptive title to every code block (`.Title here`)
- Break down what the code does AFTER showing it
- Encourage learners to run the code themselves
- Connect code to learning objectives

### 5. Query Results - Encourage Interaction, Use Tables

**DON'T show results in code blocks:**

```asciidoc
Result:
----
productName                    unitPrice
"Côte de Blaye"                263.50
"Thüringer Rostbratwurst"      123.79
----
```

**DO encourage learners to run queries:**

```asciidoc
Try running this query in your Query tool.

You should see results similar to:

[options="header",cols="2,1"]
|===
| Product Name | Unit Price

| Côte de Blaye | 263.50
| Thüringer Rostbratwurst | 123.79
| Mishi Kobe Niku | 97.00
|===
```

**Best practice:**
- Use imperative prompts: "Try running...", "Execute the following...", "Run this query and observe..."
- Show results only when understanding the output is critical to learning
- ALWAYS use AsciiDoc tables with `[options="header"]` for results, never code blocks
- Keep result tables concise (3-5 rows maximum)
- Add "similar to" or "like" to indicate results may vary slightly

### 6. Mermaid Diagrams - Use Circles for Graph Nodes

**REQUIRED: Graph nodes must be circles, not boxes.**

**DON'T use boxes:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Customer] -->|PLACED| B[Order]
    B -->|ORDERS| C[Product]
```

**DO use circles:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A((Customer)) -->|PLACED| B((Order))
    B -->|ORDERS| C((Product))
```

**Alternative circle syntax:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    Customer((Customer)) -->|PLACED| Order((Order))
    Order -->|ORDERS| Product((Product))
```

**Rules:**
- Use `((NodeName))` for circle nodes
- Keep relationship labels clear and readable
- Use colors appropriately (current colors are fine)
- Ensure diagrams are simple and focused
- Limit to 3-6 nodes per diagram for clarity

### 7. Imagery Over Text - Show, Don't Just Tell

**REQUIRED: Use screenshots and visuals, not just bullet points.**

**DON'T write text-heavy descriptions of UI:**

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Using the Query Tool

The Query tool has many features:
* Write and execute Cypher queries
* Visualize query results as graphs or tables
* Explore your data interactively
* Save and share queries
```

**DO use two-column layout with screenshot:**

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2]
== Using the Query Tool

[.col]
====
The Query tool lets you write and execute Cypher queries directly in your browser.

You can visualize results as graphs or tables, making it easy to explore your data interactively.
====

[.col]
====
image::images/query-tool-screenshot.png[Query Tool interface showing a Cypher query and graph visualization]
====
```

**When to use imagery:**
- Tool interfaces → Screenshots
- Data models → Mermaid diagrams
- Workflows → Flowcharts or numbered screenshots
- Relationships → Graph visualizations
- Comparisons → Side-by-side diagrams

**Sources for images:**
1. Copy from source courses when appropriate
2. Take new screenshots from actual tools (Aura, Data Importer, Query tool)
3. Create mermaid diagrams for graph structures
4. Note image requirements in OUTLINE.adoc files

### 8. Tone and Style - Natural, Balanced, No AI Artifacts

**CRITICAL: Write for humans, not like an AI.**

**AI Artifacts to AVOID:**
- "Comprehensive understanding"
- "Delve into"
- "It's worth noting that"
- "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally" at the start of every paragraph
- Overly formal academic language
- Bullet points that restate the same thing 3 different ways

**Sales Language to AVOID:**
- "Excel at" → Use "are well-suited for" or "provide benefits for"
- "Best-in-class" → Use factual comparisons
- "Revolutionary" or "game-changing" → Describe actual benefits
- "Powerful" or "amazing" → Explain specific capabilities
- "Seamlessly" → Describe how it actually works
- Superlatives without evidence → Stick to demonstrable facts

**DON'T - Wordy and verbose:**
```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Understanding the Fundamental Concepts of Relationships

In the realm of graph databases, relationships represent a fundamental
and critically important concept that serves as the cornerstone of
connecting disparate entities within your data model. It is essential
to develop a comprehensive understanding of how relationships function
and the various ways in which they can be leveraged to create meaningful
connections between nodes.
```

**DO - Concise and clear:**
```asciidoc
[.slide]
== How Relationships Work

Relationships connect nodes in your graph and represent how entities relate to each other.

Every relationship has three key parts:

* A type (like PLACED or ORDERS)
* A direction (from one node to another)
* Optional properties (like quantity or price)
```

**Balance slide content:**
- **Too wordy**: Paragraphs of 100+ words, multiple complex sentences, overexplanation
- **Too sparse**: Single bullet point, no context, assumes too much knowledge
- **Just right**: 2-4 clear sentences or 3-5 focused bullet points per slide

**Writing style checklist:**
- ✅ Use "you will" not "you'll" or "we will"
- ✅ Action-oriented headers in sentence case (not questions)
- ✅ Conversational but professional tone
- ✅ Plain language, avoid jargon
- ✅ Short sentences (15-20 words average)
- ✅ Active voice, not passive
- ✅ Specific examples, not abstract concepts
- ✅ Factual language, not sales language

**Avoid sales language - use factual statements:**

**DON'T - Sales language:**
```asciidoc
Graph databases excel at handling connected data and provide amazing performance
for complex queries. They seamlessly handle relationships and deliver powerful
insights that are impossible with traditional databases.
```

**DO - Factual, educational language:**
```asciidoc
Graph databases are well-suited for connected data because they store relationships
as first-class citizens. Traversing relationships is more efficient than JOIN
operations, which can improve query performance for highly connected datasets.
```

### 9. Dataset References - Natural, Not Labeled

**DON'T explicitly label the dataset repeatedly:**
```asciidoc
In the Northwind Dataset, we have customers.
The Northwind Dataset contains orders.
We'll import The Northwind Dataset into Neo4j.
```

**DO reference naturally:**
```asciidoc
Northwind is a fictitious food company with customers, orders, and products.
You'll import customer and order data from CSV files.
This data represents a real business scenario.
```

**Guidelines:**
- First mention: "Northwind dataset" or "the Northwind data" (lowercase "dataset")
- Subsequent mentions: "Northwind" or "this data" or "the data"
- Don't use "The Northwind Dataset" as a proper noun repeatedly
- Focus on what the data represents, not labeling it

### 10. Screenshots - Required for All Tool References

**CRITICAL: Every tool mentioned must have a screenshot.**

**Required screenshots:**
- Aura Console dashboard
- Instance creation flow
- Data Importer interface (main view, mapping view, import preview)
- Query tool (Browser/Query Console with a query running)
- Explore tool (graph visualization)
- Instance management page

**Screenshot guidelines:**
- Use actual tool screenshots, not mock-ups
- Crop to show relevant portions, not full screen
- Add descriptive alt text
- Reference screenshots with context: "As shown in the screenshot..." or "The interface displays..."
- Update screenshots if tools change

**Where to place screenshots:**
- Copy from source courses when appropriate
- Take new screenshots when needed for workshop context
- Store in `modules/X-module-name/lessons/Y-lesson-name/images/`
- Use `.png` or `.jpg` format

**Example image reference:**
```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2]
== Data Importer Interface

[.col]
====
The Data Importer provides a visual way to map CSV files to your graph model.

On the left, you'll see your CSV files. On the right, you'll design your nodes and relationships.
====

## Workshop Pedagogy

Workshops follow GraphAcademy's iterative learning approach with hands-on practice:

### Iterative Learning Cycle

Each module should follow the **Learn → Recognize → Recall** pattern:

1. **Learn** - Theory lesson introduces concepts with examples
2. **Recognize** - Quiz or question reinforces the ideas
3. **Recall** - Challenge lesson where learners apply the concept

**Maximum 3 iterations per module.**

### PRIMM Framework for Challenges

When introducing practical tasks, use the PRIMM framework to move learners from passive to active:

- **P**redict - What do you think the code/query will do?
- **R**un - Execute it and see the results
- **I**nvestigate - Examine how it works
- **M**odify - Change it and observe effects
- **M**ake - Create your own solution

This progression gives learners agency: "Not mine" → "Mine" → "All mine"

### Core Principles Applied to Workshops

- **Lead with concepts** - Brief theory before hands-on practice
- **Make concrete** - Use real-world examples (Northwind business data)
- **Get hands on** - Learners create something "their own"
- **Model everything** - Show worked examples, describe outputs
- **Challenge misconceptions** - Address common mistakes proactively

## Workshop Structure with Stretch Goals

Workshops should have **two tiers of content WITHIN EACH MODULE**:

### Required Lessons (Core - 2 hours)

The essential path through each module that accomplishes the workshop's main goal. All learners complete these.

### Optional Lessons (Stretch Goals - Additional 1-2 hours)

Extended lessons within each module that:

- Deepen understanding of that module's concepts
- Explore advanced variations
- Provide additional practice
- Can be completed as homework
- Extend a 2-hour workshop to 4 hours for instructor-led sessions

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Each module has BOTH required and optional lessons, not entirely optional modules.**

**Implement using `:optional: true` attribute:**

```asciidoc
= Advanced Pattern Matching
:type: lesson
:order: 4
:optional: true

[Content for learners who want to go deeper in this module...]
```

### Planning Content Tiers

**Each module should have:**

- **Required lessons** (2-3 lessons) - Core concepts everyone needs
- **Optional lessons** (1-2 lessons) - Stretch goals for deeper learning

**Example: 2-Hour Core + 2-Hour Stretch Workshop Structure**

```
Module 1: Aura Setup (20 mins core + 10 mins stretch)

├── 5. Aggregation and Analytics (STRETCH - :optional: true) ⭐
├── 6. Performance Optimization (STRETCH - :optional: true) ⭐
└── 7. Workshop Review and Next Steps (Required - FINAL LESSON) ✅
```

**Total: 2 hours core (required) + 2 hours stretch (optional) = 4 hours maximum**

### Final Lesson Requirement

**⚠️ CRITICAL: The last lesson in the workshop MUST trigger the completion modal.**

The final lesson should be **REQUIRED** (not optional) and must include ONE of:

1. **Quiz lesson** (`:type: quiz`) with 2-5 questions tying together all concepts
2. **Review lesson** with questions using `questions::[]` directive
3. **Next steps lesson** with a completion action

**DO NOT use auto-completing lessons (plain `read::` button) as the final lesson.**

**Example Final Lesson - Quiz:**

```asciidoc
= Workshop Review
:type: quiz
:order: 10

Test your knowledge of everything you learned in this workshop.

include::questions/1-data-modeling.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::questions/2-importing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::questions/3-querying.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
```

**Example Final Lesson - Review with Questions:**

```asciidoc

   - Example: "Beginners with no Neo4j experience" or "Developers who know Cypher basics"

3. **Duration and Stretch Goals**
   - How long should the core workshop be? (1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours)
   - Should there be optional stretch goals for extended learning?
   - If yes, how much additional optional content? (+1 hour, +2 hours)
   - Is this instructor-led or self-paced?

4. **Source Courses**
   - Which existing courses should we borrow content from?
   - What specific topics from each course are relevant?
   - Example: "Use data modeling from modeling-fundamentals, import from importing-fundamentals, queries from neo4j-fundamentals"

5. **Practical Focus**
   - What dataset or domain will be used? (Northwind, Movies, custom)
   - What tools are needed? (Aura, Data Importer, specific drivers)
   - Should learners follow along or just observe?

6. **Content Adaptation**

---

## Phase 2: Create Workshop Structure and Outline

Once approved, create the workshop structure:

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/
├── course.adoc
├── README.md
├── modules/
│   ├── 1-[module-slug]/
│   │   ├── module.adoc
│   │   └── lessons/
│   │       ├── 1-[lesson-slug]/
│   │       │   ├── lesson.adoc
│   │       │   └── images/
│   │       ├── 2-[lesson-slug]/
│   │       └── 3-[lesson-slug]/
│   ├── 2-[module-slug]/
│   ├── 3-[module-slug]/
│   └── 4-[module-slug]/
└── images/
```

### Step 2: Create course.adoc

Follow course-outline-checklist.md with workshop-specific attributes:

```asciidoc
= Workshop Title
:categories: workshop:1, beginners:1, [other relevant categories]
:status: active
:duration: 2 hours
:caption: One-sentence description of what learners will build/accomplish
:key-points: Key skill 1, Key skill 2, Key skill 3, Hands-on practice

[Opening paragraph explaining what the workshop covers and what learners will build]

== Duration

This workshop takes approximately [X] hours to complete.

== Prerequisites

To complete this workshop, you will need:

* [Prerequisite 1]
* [Prerequisite 2]
* [Tool or account needed]

== What you will learn

* [Practical skill 1]
* [Practical skill 2]
* [Practical skill 3]
* [What they will have built]

[.includes]
== This workshop includes

* [lessons]#X lessons#
* [challenges]#X hands-on exercises#
```

### Step 3: Identify Source Content

For each module and lesson, document which source course and lesson to borrow from:

```
## Content Mapping

**Module 1: Aura Setup**
- Lesson 1: What is Aura?
  - Source: aura-fundamentals/lessons/1-what-is-aura
  - Adaptations: Make more concise, focus on Free tier only

- Lesson 2: Create Instance
  - Source: aura-fundamentals/lessons/2-create-instance
  - Adaptations: Keep as-is, add images

**Module 2: Data Modeling**
- Lesson 1: Modeling Basics
  - Source: modeling-fundamentals/lessons/1-getting-started
  - Adaptations: Condense theory, apply to workshop dataset immediately

... (continue for all lessons)
```

### Step 4: Create Lesson Outlines

**IMPORTANT:** Create outlines as SEPARATE FILES before any content generation. These files will be reviewed locally in the user's IDE.

For each lesson, create a `OUTLINE.adoc` file in the lesson directory that shows:

1. Source lesson(s) it's based on

✅ Created OUTLINE.adoc files for all [Y] lessons

Each OUTLINE.adoc file contains:
- Source course information
- Specific adaptations needed
- Images to copy/create
- Rules that apply to that lesson
- Detailed content outline

📂 File locations:
- asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/course.adoc
- asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/1-[module]/module.adoc
- asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/1-[module]/lessons/1-[lesson]/OUTLINE.adoc
- ... (all lesson outlines)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: All outlines are in AsciiDoc format (.adoc files).
   NO MARKDOWN FILES were created.

🔍 Next Steps - Please review the outlines in your IDE:

1. Open the workshop directory in your IDE
2. Review each OUTLINE.adoc file
3. Check that source courses are correct
4. Verify adaptations make sense
5. Add/remove sections as needed
6. Check image requirements

Once you've reviewed and refined the outlines, tell me to proceed.

Would you like to:
1. Review and refine the outlines before I generate content? (RECOMMENDED)
2. Proceed with content generation as outlined?
3. Make structural changes to modules or lessons?

Let me know when you're ready for Phase 3: Content Generation.
```

**STOP and wait for user approval before Phase 3.**

---

## Phase 3: Content Generation

Once outlines are approved, generate workshop content ONE LESSON AT A TIME:

### Content Generation Workflow (Per Lesson):

#### Step 1: Read and Understand

1. **Read the OUTLINE.adoc file** for the current lesson

   ```
   Read: asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/[X]/lessons/[Y]/OUTLINE.adoc
   ```

   - Note source courses
   - Note specific adaptations required
   - Note which rules apply
   - Note image requirements

2. **Read the source lesson(s)** from the specified course(s)

   ```
   Read: asciidoc/courses/[source-course]/modules/[module]/lessons/[lesson]/lesson.adoc
   ```

   - Understand the full content
   - Identify sections to include/exclude
   - Note examples to adapt

3. **Read previous workshop lesson** (if not the first lesson)
   ```
   Read: asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/[X]/lessons/[Y-1]/lesson.adoc
   ```

   - Understand what was just taught
   - Ensure proper scaffolding and context

#### Step 2: Generate Content

4. **Adapt and generate the full lesson content** following:

   ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Review and apply ALL "Technical Requirements for Workshop Content" from the beginning of this document.**

   **Mandatory Technical Requirements (see full details above):**

   1. ✅ **Lead with problems, not solutions** - Start with what they'll build, not tools
   2. ✅ **Stay true to source material** - No hallucinations, only adapt existing content
   3. ✅ **Slide formatting** - Consistent [.slide] and [.slide.discrete] usage
   4. ✅ **Code blocks with explanations** - Never show code without context
   5. ✅ **Query results in tables** - Use AsciiDoc tables, not code blocks; encourage interaction
   6. ✅ **Mermaid diagrams use circles** - Graph nodes must be circles `((Node))`, not boxes
   7. ✅ **Imagery over text** - Screenshots and diagrams, not just bullet points
   8. ✅ **Natural tone** - No AI artifacts, balanced content, conversational style
   9. ✅ **Natural dataset references** - Say "Northwind", not "The Northwind Dataset"
   10. ✅ **Screenshots required** - Every tool mentioned needs a screenshot

   **From .cursor/rules/asciidoc-syntax.mdc:**
   - ⚠️ **NO MARKDOWN** - only AsciiDoc format
   - TWO line breaks between all elements (headers, paragraphs, lists)
   - Proper list spacing (blank line before lists)

   **From .cursor/review-lesson-content.mdc:**
   - Two-part opening pattern:
     - Part 1: Context from previous lesson OR why topic matters
     - Part 2: "In this lesson, you will learn..."
   - Action-oriented headers in sentence case (not questions)
   - "you will" tone (never "we will" or "you'll")
   - Length under 5 minutes, 1-2 concepts max
   - Casual, friendly, no jargon

   **From .cursor/rules/slides-formatting.mdc (if instructor-led):**
   - `[.slide.discrete]` for opening section
   - `[.slide]` for main sections
   - `[.slide.discrete]` for subsections
   - `[.summary]` for summary section
   - `[.col-2]` layouts for images

   **From .cursor/write-lesson-summary.mdc:**
   - Bullet points with **bold** concept names
   - Brief descriptions after each concept
   - Forward reference to next lesson

   **From .cursor/technical-lesson-review.mdc:**
   - Opening must have level-2 header after attributes
   - Admonitions must have titles
   - Proper AsciiDoc code blocks ([source,cypher] with ----)
   - **Code blocks:** Use _individual_ source blocks with a _title_ that describes the code underneath. One statement per block. Do not put multiple Cypher statements in one block.

   **Code block format (required):**

   ```asciidoc
   [source,cypher]
   .Short title describing the query
   ----
   MATCH (c:Customer) RETURN c LIMIT 1;
   ----
   ```

   Use a separate `[source,cypher]` block for each example; add a dot-prefixed title (e.g. `.Find customers by label`) so each block is self-describing.

   **From .cursor/rules/neo4j-cypher.mdc (if Cypher present):**
   - Use COUNT {} subqueries instead of OPTIONAL MATCH for counts
   - Use pattern comprehensions for nested values

   **For Data Modeling Lessons (CRITICAL):**
   - **Focus on "WHY" not "what"** - Explain reasoning, not just definitions
   - **Compare with relational** - Show why graph approach is better, especially for many-to-many relationships
   - **Explain each decision** - When you say "Customer is a node," explain WHY (has independent existence, own data)
   - **For many-to-many relationships** - Always compare pivot tables vs. graph relationships with examples:
     ```
     Relational: orders JOIN order_details JOIN products (3 tables, 2 JOINs)
     Graph: (Order)-[:ORDERS]->(Product) (direct traversal, no JOINs)
     ```
   - **Property vs node decisions** - Explain when something should be a property vs. a node, with reasoning:
     - Property: Simple values used for filtering (country as text)
     - Node: Entities with their own data and relationships (Category with description)
   - **Relationship properties** - Explain WHY data belongs on relationships (quantity belongs on ORDER-PRODUCT connection, not on either node)
   - **Reference previous lesson** - Opening must say "In the previous lesson, you learned..." not "You learned..."
   - **Tables in AsciiDoc format** - Use `[options="header"]` and `|===` format, never markdown tables

5. **Write the content** to lesson.adoc file
   ```
   Write: asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/[X]/lessons/[Y]/lesson.adoc
   ```

#### Step 3: Re-Read and Review

⚠️ **CRITICAL: After writing, immediately re-read the file to review it**

6. **Re-read the generated lesson.adoc file**

   ```
   Read: asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/[X]/lessons/[Y]/lesson.adoc
   ```

   - This allows you to see what was actually written
   - You can only review and fix what you've read

7. **Review against ALL rules** and fix issues:

   ```
   Check each rule systematically:

   ✅ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - from top of document)
      1. Leads with problems, not solutions? (First lesson explains what they'll build?)
      2. No hallucinated content? (Only includes concepts from source courses?)
      3. Slide formatting consistent? ([.slide.discrete] for intro/subsections, [.slide] for main?)
      4. Code blocks have explanations? (Context before and after every code block?)
      5. Query results in tables, not code blocks? (Uses [options="header"] tables?)
      6. Mermaid diagrams use circles? (((Node)) syntax, not [Node]?)
      7. Uses imagery over text? (Screenshots and diagrams, not just bullet points?)
      8. Natural tone, no AI artifacts? (No "comprehensive", "delve into", etc.?)
      9. Natural dataset references? (Says "Northwind", not "The Northwind Dataset"?)
      10. Screenshots present for all tools? (Every tool mentioned has an image?)

   ✅ .cursor/review-lesson-content.mdc
      - Two-part opening?
      - Action-oriented headers?
      - "you will" tone?
      - Under 5 minutes?
      - 1-2 concepts?

   ✅ .cursor/rules/asciidoc-syntax.mdc
      - Two line breaks everywhere?
      - No markdown syntax?
      - Blank lines before lists?

   ✅ .cursor/rules/slides-formatting.mdc
      - Proper [.slide] markers?
      - [.slide.discrete] for opening and subsections?
      - [.summary] marker?

   ✅ .cursor/write-lesson-summary.mdc
      - Bold concept names?
      - Bullet point format?
      - Next lesson reference?

   ✅ .cursor/technical-lesson-review.mdc
      - Opening header structure?
      - Admonition titles?
      - Code block formatting?
      - Each [source,cypher] block is individual with a title describing the code?

   ✅ .cursor/rules/neo4j-cypher.mdc (if Cypher)
      - COUNT subqueries not OPTIONAL MATCH?
      - Pattern comprehensions for nesting?

   ✅ Data Modeling Lessons (if modeling content)
      - Focuses on "WHY" not "what"?
      - Compares with relational approach for many-to-many?
      - Explains decision reasoning (why Customer is a node)?
      - Shows pivot table vs relationship comparison with examples?
      - Explains property vs node decisions with reasoning?
      - Explains relationship properties (why data belongs there)?
      - Opening references previous lesson "In the previous lesson..."?
      - Tables use AsciiDoc format ([options="header"] |===), not markdown?
   ```

8. **Fix any issues found**
   - Re-read the file again after making edits
   - Verify fixes are correct
   - Build upon the content iteratively

9. **Update todo** to mark lesson complete

10. **Move to next lesson** and repeat from Step 1

### Why Re-Reading is Critical:

- **You can't review what you haven't read** - After writing a file, you must re-read it to see the actual content
- **Context builds over time** - Each read gives you more understanding to improve the content
- **Iterative improvement** - Read → Edit → Re-read → Edit again if needed
- **Catch errors** - You'll spot formatting issues, tone problems, or missing content only by reading the generated output

### Creating the Final Lesson (Completion Modal)

⚠️ **CRITICAL: The last lesson must trigger the completion modal.**

The final lesson should:

- Be **REQUIRED** (do not use `:optional: true`)
- Include questions or be a quiz to verify completion
- Celebrate learner accomplishments
- Provide clear next steps

**Option 1: Final Review Lesson with Questions**

```asciidoc

```

**Option 2: Final Quiz Lesson**

```asciidoc
= Workshop Quiz
:type: quiz
:order: 15

Test your knowledge of everything covered in this workshop.


include::questions/1-data-modeling.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::questions/2-importing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::questions/3-querying.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::questions/4-best-practices.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
```

**Questions for Final Lesson (2-5 questions recommended):**

Create questions that:

- Tie together concepts from multiple modules
- Test understanding, not just memorization
- Are fair and solvable with workshop knowledge
- Celebrate success with encouraging solution text

**Example question:**

```asciidoc
[.question]
= Workshop Knowledge Check

You've imported the Northwind dataset and need to find all products supplied by a specific company. Which Cypher pattern would you use?

* [ ] `MATCH (p:Product) RETURN p`
* [ ] `MATCH (s:Supplier) RETURN s.products`
* [x] `MATCH (s:Supplier {companyName: 'Tokyo Traders'})-[:SUPPLIES]->(p:Product) RETURN p`
* [ ] `MATCH (p:Product WHERE supplierId = 1) RETURN p`

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Remember that relationships connect nodes. You need to traverse from the Supplier to the Product.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Correct!** You use a relationship pattern to traverse from the Supplier node to connected Product nodes.

This is exactly what you learned in Module 3 when creating relationships.
====
```

### Adaptation Guidelines:

**From Theory Courses:**

- Condense explanations - keep only what's essential
- Add "why this matters for the workshop" context
- Include just enough theory to do the practical work
- Skip deep dives and edge cases

**From Application Courses:**

- Extract relevant code patterns
- Adapt to workshop's specific stack/framework
- Simplify setup if possible
- Focus on "happy path" implementations

**From Fundamentals Courses:**

- Keep foundational concepts but be more concise
- Immediately apply concepts to workshop domain
- Skip theoretical examples, use workshop data

### Progress Tracking:

After every 3-5 lessons:

```
Workshop Generation Progress:
✅ Module 1, Lesson 1 - What is Neo4j Aura? - Complete
✅ Module 1, Lesson 2 - Create Your Instance - Complete
✅ Module 1, Lesson 3 - Aura Tools Overview - Complete
⏳ Module 2, Lesson 1 - Data Modeling Basics - In Progress
⏸ Module 2, Lesson 2 - Understanding Northwind - Pending
⏸ Module 2, Lesson 3 - Modeling Nodes - Pending

[X] of [Y] lessons complete

Continuing with content generation...
```

---

## Phase 4: Add Images and Media

After all lesson content is generated:

### Copy Images from Source Courses:

1. **Identify image requirements** from lesson outlines
2. **Copy images** from source courses:
   ```bash
   cp source-course/images/screenshot.png workshop/modules/1-module/lessons/1-lesson/images/
   ```
3. **Verify all image references** in lessons point to correct files
4. **Add any missing images** noted during content generation

### Handle Diagrams:

- **Keep** graph structure diagrams (nodes, relationships, data models)
- **Comment out** process flowcharts and UI navigation diagrams
- **Replace** with mermaid only if they add pedagogical value
- **Remove** decorative diagrams that don't enhance understanding

---

## Phase 5: Attribution and Final Review

### Add Source Attribution:

1. **Update REVIEW_SUMMARY.md** with:

   ```markdown
   ## Source Courses

   This workshop combines and adapts content from the following GraphAcademy courses:

   - **[Course Name]** (link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/[slug][Course Link^])
     - Module X: [What was borrowed]
     - Module Y: [What was borrowed]

   - **[Course Name]** (link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/[slug][Course Link^])
     - [What was borrowed]

   All content has been adapted for this workshop's specific goals and context.
   ```

2. **Update README.md** with similar attribution section

## Workshop-Specific Best Practices

### Content Adaptation:

1. **Be Ruthless with Theory**
   - Only include theory that's absolutely necessary
   - Get to hands-on practice quickly
   - "Just enough to do the work" is the goal

2. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Use ONE dataset/domain throughout (e.g., all Northwind)
   - Use ONE set of tools (e.g., all Aura + Data Importer)
   - Keep examples building on each other

3. **Focus on the Goal**
   - Every lesson should move toward the workshop's end goal
   - Remove tangents and "nice to know" content
   - Ask: "Does this help accomplish the workshop goal?"

4. **Practical Over Comprehensive**
   - Show the "happy path" - don't cover every edge case
   - Teach enough to be productive, not to be an expert
   - Reference full courses for deeper learning

### Quality Standards:

- Follow all .cursor/rules/ guidelines
- Proper AsciiDoc formatting (never markdown)
- Two line breaks between elements
- Action-oriented headers in sentence case
- Two-part opening for every lesson
- Summary sections with bullet points
- Source attribution

### Attribution Requirements:

- **Always credit source courses** with links
- Note specific modules/lessons borrowed
- Acknowledge any images or diagrams used
- Mention adaptations made
- Include "Adapted from..." notes where helpful

## Example Workflow

```
User: Create a workshop for importing the Northwind dataset into Neo4j

Assistant (Phase 1): Great! Let me ask some questions:

1. Target Audience: Beginners with no Neo4j experience?
2. Duration: How long? 2-3 hours?
3. What should they accomplish: Import Northwind and run queries?
4. Source courses: Use modeling-fundamentals, importing-fundamentals, neo4j-fundamentals?
5. Format: Self-paced or instructor-led? With slides?
6. Images: Copy from source courses or create new?

User: Yes beginners, 2 hours, yes import and query, yes those courses, instructor-led with slides, copy images and replace non-graph diagrams with mermaid
```
