# Create a New GraphAcademy Workshop

This guide walks you through creating a hands-on workshop by combining and adapting content from existing GraphAcademy courses. Workshops are focused, practical learning experiences that guide learners through a specific goal or project.

## What is a Workshop?

A **workshop** is a shorter, hands-on learning experience (typically 1-3 hours) that:
- Combines content from multiple existing courses
- Focuses on a specific practical goal or project
- Guides learners through accomplishing something concrete
- Adapts theory lessons to be more concise and action-oriented
- Emphasizes hands-on practice over comprehensive theory
- Includes **stretch goals** for extended learning

**Examples:**
- "Import the Northwind Dataset" - combines data modeling + importing + querying
- "Build a Recommendation Engine" - combines Cypher + GDS + application development
- "Set Up Production Monitoring" - combines Aura + metrics + alerting

## Workshop Pedagogy

Workshops follow GraphAcademy's iterative learning approach with hands-on practice:

### Iterative Learning Cycle

Each module should follow the **Learn → Recognize → Recall** pattern:

1. **Learn** - Theory lesson introduces concepts with examples
2. **Recognize** - Quiz or question reinforces the ideas
3. **Recall** - Challenge lesson where learners apply the concept

**Maximum 3 iterations per module.**

### PRIMM Framework for Challenges

When introducing practical tasks, use the PRIMM framework to move learners from passive to active:

- **P**redict - What do you think the code/query will do?
- **R**un - Execute it and see the results
- **I**nvestigate - Examine how it works
- **M**odify - Change it and observe effects
- **M**ake - Create your own solution

This progression gives learners agency: "Not mine" → "Mine" → "All mine"

### Core Principles Applied to Workshops

- **Lead with concepts** - Brief theory before hands-on practice
- **Make concrete** - Use real-world examples (Northwind business data)
- **Get hands on** - Learners create something "their own"
- **Model everything** - Show worked examples, describe outputs
- **Challenge misconceptions** - Address common mistakes proactively

## Workshop Structure with Stretch Goals

Workshops should have **two tiers of content WITHIN EACH MODULE**:

### Required Lessons (Core - 2 hours)
The essential path through each module that accomplishes the workshop's main goal. All learners complete these.

### Optional Lessons (Stretch Goals - Additional 1-2 hours)
Extended lessons within each module that:
- Deepen understanding of that module's concepts
- Explore advanced variations
- Provide additional practice
- Can be completed as homework
- Extend a 2-hour workshop to 4 hours for instructor-led sessions

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Each module has BOTH required and optional lessons, not entirely optional modules.**

**Implement using `:optional: true` attribute:**

```asciidoc
= Advanced Pattern Matching
:type: lesson
:order: 4
:optional: true

[Content for learners who want to go deeper in this module...]
```

### Planning Content Tiers

**Each module should have:**
- **Required lessons** (2-3 lessons) - Core concepts everyone needs
- **Optional lessons** (1-2 lessons) - Stretch goals for deeper learning

**Example: 2-Hour Core + 2-Hour Stretch Workshop Structure**

```
Module 1: Aura Setup (20 mins core + 10 mins stretch)
├── 1. What is Neo4j Aura? (Required)
├── 2. Create Your Instance (Required)
├── 3. Aura Tools Overview (Required)
└── 4. Advanced Aura Features (STRETCH - :optional: true) ⭐

Module 2: Data Modeling (40 mins core + 30 mins stretch)
├── 1. Understanding Graphs (Required)
├── 2. Modeling Northwind Nodes (Required)
├── 3. Modeling Relationships (Required)
├── 4. Testing Your Model (Required)
├── 5. Advanced Modeling Patterns (STRETCH - :optional: true) ⭐

Module 3: Importing Data (40 mins core + 40 mins stretch)
├── 1. Data Importer Basics (Required)
├── 2. Import Nodes (Required)
├── 3. Create Relationships (Required)
├── 4. Run the Import (Required)
├── 5. Advanced Import Patterns (STRETCH - :optional: true) ⭐

├── 2. Reading Northwind Data (Required)
├── 3. Filtering Results (Required)
├── 4. Advanced Pattern Matching (STRETCH - :optional: true) ⭐
├── 5. Aggregation and Analytics (STRETCH - :optional: true) ⭐
├── 6. Performance Optimization (STRETCH - :optional: true) ⭐
└── 7. Workshop Review and Next Steps (Required - FINAL LESSON) ✅
```

**Total: 2 hours core (required) + 2 hours stretch (optional) = 4 hours maximum**

### Final Lesson Requirement

**⚠️ CRITICAL: The last lesson in the workshop MUST trigger the completion modal.**

The final lesson should be **REQUIRED** (not optional) and must include ONE of:

1. **Quiz lesson** (`:type: quiz`) with 2-5 questions tying together all concepts
2. **Review lesson** with questions using `questions::[]` directive
3. **Next steps lesson** with a completion action

**DO NOT use auto-completing lessons (plain `read::` button) as the final lesson.**

**Example Final Lesson - Quiz:**

```asciidoc
= Workshop Review
:type: quiz
:order: 10

Test your knowledge of everything you learned in this workshop.

include::questions/1-data-modeling.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::questions/2-importing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::questions/3-querying.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
```

**Example Final Lesson - Review with Questions:**

```asciidoc
= Workshop Review and Next Steps
:type: lesson
:order: 10

## Phase 1: Discovery and Planning

Before creating any content, gather information about the workshop through questions:

### Questions to Ask:

1. **Workshop Goal**
   - What specific task or project will learners accomplish?
   - What will they have built/done by the end?
   - Example: "Import Northwind data and run business queries" or "Build a movie recommendation API"

2. **Target Audience**
   - Who is this workshop for? (beginners, developers, data analysts, admins)
   - What prior knowledge is required?
   - Example: "Beginners with no Neo4j experience" or "Developers who know Cypher basics"

3. **Duration and Stretch Goals**
   - How long should the core workshop be? (1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours)
   - Should there be optional stretch goals for extended learning?
   - If yes, how much additional optional content? (+1 hour, +2 hours)
   - Is this instructor-led or self-paced?

4. **Source Courses**
   - Which existing courses should we borrow content from?
   - What specific topics from each course are relevant?
   - Example: "Use data modeling from modeling-fundamentals, import from importing-fundamentals, queries from neo4j-fundamentals"

5. **Practical Focus**
   - What dataset or domain will be used? (Northwind, Movies, custom)
   - What tools are needed? (Aura, Data Importer, specific drivers)
   - Should learners follow along or just observe?

6. **Content Adaptation**
   - Should we use existing images or create new ones?
   - Should non-graph diagrams be replaced with mermaid diagrams?

## Phase 2: Create Workshop Structure and Outline

Once approved, create the workshop structure:

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/
├── course.adoc
├── README.md
├── modules/
│   ├── 1-[module-slug]/
│   │   ├── module.adoc
│   │   └── lessons/
│   │       ├── 1-[lesson-slug]/
│   │       │   ├── lesson.adoc
│   │       │   └── images/
│   │       ├── 2-[lesson-slug]/
│   │       └── 3-[lesson-slug]/
│   ├── 2-[module-slug]/
│   ├── 3-[module-slug]/
│   └── 4-[module-slug]/
└── images/
```

### Step 2: Create course.adoc

Follow course-outline-checklist.md with workshop-specific attributes:

```asciidoc
= Workshop Title
:categories: workshop:1, beginners:1, [other relevant categories]
:status: active
:duration: 2 hours
:caption: One-sentence description of what learners will build/accomplish
:key-points: Key skill 1, Key skill 2, Key skill 3, Hands-on practice

[Opening paragraph explaining what the workshop covers and what learners will build]

* [Practical skill 3]
* [What they will have built]

[.includes]
== This workshop includes

* [lessons]#X lessons#
* [challenges]#X hands-on exercises#
```

### Step 3: Identify Source Content

For each module and lesson, document which source course and lesson to borrow from:

```
## Content Mapping

**Module 1: Aura Setup**
- Lesson 1: What is Aura?
  - Source: aura-fundamentals/lessons/1-what-is-aura
  - Adaptations: Make more concise, focus on Free tier only

- Lesson 2: Create Instance
  - Source: aura-fundamentals/lessons/2-create-instance
  - Adaptations: Keep as-is, add images

**Module 2: Data Modeling**
- Lesson 1: Modeling Basics
  - Source: modeling-fundamentals/lessons/1-getting-started
  - Adaptations: Condense theory, apply to workshop dataset immediately

... (continue for all lessons)
```

### Step 4: Create Lesson Outlines

**IMPORTANT:** Create outlines as SEPARATE FILES before any content generation. These files will be reviewed locally in the user's IDE.

For each lesson, create a `OUTLINE.adoc` file in the lesson directory that shows:
1. Source lesson(s) it's based on
2. Specific sections to include/exclude
3. Adaptations needed (change examples, add context, simplify theory)
4. Images to copy or create
5. Key rules that apply to this lesson

```

Let me know when you're ready for Phase 3: Content Generation.
```

**STOP and wait for user approval before Phase 3.**

---

## Phase 3: Content Generation

Once outlines are approved, generate workshop content ONE LESSON AT A TIME:

### Content Generation Workflow (Per Lesson):

#### Step 1: Read and Understand

1. **Read the OUTLINE.adoc file** for the current lesson
   ```
   Read: asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/[X]/lessons/[Y]/OUTLINE.adoc
   ```
   - Note source courses
   - Note specific adaptations required
   - Note which rules apply
   - Note image requirements

2. **Read the source lesson(s)** from the specified course(s)
   ```
   Read: asciidoc/courses/[source-course]/modules/[module]/lessons/[lesson]/lesson.adoc
   ```
   - Understand the full content
   - Identify sections to include/exclude
   - Note examples to adapt

3. **Read previous workshop lesson** (if not the first lesson)
   ```
   Read: asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/[X]/lessons/[Y-1]/lesson.adoc
   ```
   - Understand what was just taught
   - Ensure proper scaffolding and context

#### Step 2: Generate Content

4. **Adapt and generate the full lesson content** following:

   **From .cursor/rules/asciidoc-syntax.mdc:**
   - ⚠️ **NO MARKDOWN** - only AsciiDoc format
   - TWO line breaks between all elements (headers, paragraphs, lists)
   - Proper list spacing (blank line before lists)

   **From .cursor/review-lesson-content.mdc:**
   - Two-part opening pattern:
     - Part 1: Context from previous lesson OR why topic matters
     - Part 2: "In this lesson, you will learn..."
   - Action-oriented headers in sentence case (not questions)
   - "you will" tone (never "we will" or "you'll")
   - Length under 5 minutes, 1-2 concepts max
   - Casual, friendly, no jargon

   **From .cursor/rules/slides-formatting.mdc (if instructor-led):**
   - `[.slide.discrete]` for opening section
   - `[.slide]` for main sections
   - `[.slide.discrete]` for subsections
   - `[.summary]` for summary section
   - `[.col-2]` layouts for images

   **From .cursor/write-lesson-summary.mdc:**
   - Bullet points with **bold** concept names
   - Brief descriptions after each concept
   - Forward reference to next lesson

   **From .cursor/technical-lesson-review.mdc:**
   - Opening must have level-2 header after attributes
   - Admonitions must have titles
   - Proper AsciiDoc code blocks ([source,cypher] with ----)

   **From .cursor/rules/neo4j-cypher.mdc (if Cypher present):**
   - Use COUNT {} subqueries instead of OPTIONAL MATCH for counts
   - Use pattern comprehensions for nested values

   **For Data Modeling Lessons (CRITICAL):**
   - **Focus on "WHY" not "what"** - Explain reasoning, not just definitions
   - **Compare with relational** - Show why graph approach is better, especially for many-to-many relationships
   - **Explain each decision** - When you say "Customer is a node," explain WHY (has independent existence, own data)
   - **For many-to-many relationships** - Always compare pivot tables vs. graph relationships with examples:
     ```
     Relational: orders JOIN order_details JOIN products (3 tables, 2 JOINs)
     Graph: (Order)-[:ORDERS]->(Product) (direct traversal, no JOINs)
     ```
   - **Property vs node decisions** - Explain when something should be a property vs. a node, with reasoning:
     - Property: Simple values used for filtering (country as text)
     - Node: Entities with their own data and relationships (Category with description)
   - **Relationship properties** - Explain WHY data belongs on relationships (quantity belongs on ORDER-PRODUCT connection, not on either node)
   - **Reference previous lesson** - Opening must say "In the previous lesson, you learned..." not "You learned..."
   - **Tables in AsciiDoc format** - Use `[options="header"]` and `|===` format, never markdown tables

5. **Write the content** to lesson.adoc file
   ```
   Write: asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/[X]/lessons/[Y]/lesson.adoc
   ```

#### Step 3: Re-Read and Review

⚠️ **CRITICAL: After writing, immediately re-read the file to review it**

6. **Re-read the generated lesson.adoc file**
   ```
   Read: asciidoc/courses/workshop-[slug]/modules/[X]/lessons/[Y]/lesson.adoc
   ```
   - This allows you to see what was actually written
   - You can only review and fix what you've read

7. **Review against ALL rules** and fix issues:
   ```
   Check each rule systematically:
   ✅ .cursor/review-lesson-content.mdc
      - Two-part opening?
      - Action-oriented headers?
      - "you will" tone?
      - Under 5 minutes?
      - 1-2 concepts?

   ✅ .cursor/rules/asciidoc-syntax.mdc
      - Two line breaks everywhere?
      - No markdown syntax?
      - Blank lines before lists?

   ✅ .cursor/rules/slides-formatting.mdc
      - Proper [.slide] markers?
      - [.slide.discrete] for opening and subsections?
      - [.summary] marker?

   ✅ .cursor/write-lesson-summary.mdc
      - Bold concept names?
      - Bullet point format?
      - Next lesson reference?

   ✅ .cursor/technical-lesson-review.mdc
      - Opening header structure?
      - Admonition titles?
      - Code block formatting?

   ✅ .cursor/rules/neo4j-cypher.mdc (if Cypher)
      - COUNT subqueries not OPTIONAL MATCH?
      - Pattern comprehensions for nesting?

   ✅ Data Modeling Lessons (if modeling content)
      - Focuses on "WHY" not "what"?
      - Compares with relational approach for many-to-many?
      - Explains decision reasoning (why Customer is a node)?
      - Shows pivot table vs relationship comparison with examples?
      - Explains property vs node decisions with reasoning?
      - Explains relationship properties (why data belongs there)?
      - Opening references previous lesson "In the previous lesson..."?
      - Tables use AsciiDoc format ([options="header"] |===), not markdown?
   ```

8. **Fix any issues found**
   - Re-read the file again after making edits
   - Verify fixes are correct
   - Build upon the content iteratively

9. **Update todo** to mark lesson complete

10. **Move to next lesson** and repeat from Step 1

### Why Re-Reading is Critical:

- **You can't review what you haven't read** - After writing a file, you must re-read it to see the actual content
- **Context builds over time** - Each read gives you more understanding to improve the content
- **Iterative improvement** - Read → Edit → Re-read → Edit again if needed
- **Catch errors** - You'll spot formatting issues, tone problems, or missing content only by reading the generated output

### Creating the Final Lesson (Completion Modal)

⚠️ **CRITICAL: The last lesson must trigger the completion modal.**

The final lesson should:
- Be **REQUIRED** (do not use `:optional: true`)
- Include questions or be a quiz to verify completion
- Celebrate learner accomplishments
- Provide clear next steps

**Option 1: Final Review Lesson with Questions**

include::questions/1-data-modeling.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::questions/2-importing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::questions/3-querying.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::questions/4-best-practices.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
```

**Questions for Final Lesson (2-5 questions recommended):**

Create questions that:
- Tie together concepts from multiple modules
- Test understanding, not just memorization
- Are fair and solvable with workshop knowledge
- Celebrate success with encouraging solution text

**Example question:**

```asciidoc
[.question]
= Workshop Knowledge Check

You've imported the Northwind dataset and need to find all products supplied by a specific company. Which Cypher pattern would you use?

* [ ] `MATCH (p:Product) RETURN p`
* [ ] `MATCH (s:Supplier) RETURN s.products`
* [x] `MATCH (s:Supplier {companyName: 'Tokyo Traders'})-[:SUPPLIES]->(p:Product) RETURN p`
* [ ] `MATCH (p:Product WHERE supplierId = 1) RETURN p`

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Remember that relationships connect nodes. You need to traverse from the Supplier to the Product.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Correct!** You use a relationship pattern to traverse from the Supplier node to connected Product nodes.

This is exactly what you learned in Module 3 when creating relationships.
====
```

### Adaptation Guidelines:

**From Theory Courses:**
- Condense explanations - keep only what's essential
- Add "why this matters for the workshop" context
- Include just enough theory to do the practical work
- Skip deep dives and edge cases

**From Application Courses:**
- Extract relevant code patterns
- Adapt to workshop's specific stack/framework
- Simplify setup if possible
- Focus on "happy path" implementations

**From Fundamentals Courses:**
- Keep foundational concepts but be more concise
- Immediately apply concepts to workshop domain
- Skip theoretical examples, use workshop data

### Progress Tracking:

After every 3-5 lessons:

```
Workshop Generation Progress:
✅ Module 1, Lesson 1 - What is Neo4j Aura? - Complete
✅ Module 1, Lesson 2 - Create Your Instance - Complete
✅ Module 1, Lesson 3 - Aura Tools Overview - Complete
⏳ Module 2, Lesson 1 - Data Modeling Basics - In Progress
⏸ Module 2, Lesson 2 - Understanding Northwind - Pending
⏸ Module 2, Lesson 3 - Modeling Nodes - Pending

[X] of [Y] lessons complete

Continuing with content generation...
```

## Phase 4: Add Images and Media

After all lesson content is generated:

### Copy Images from Source Courses:

1. **Identify image requirements** from lesson outlines
2. **Copy images** from source courses:
   ```bash
   cp source-course/images/screenshot.png workshop/modules/1-module/lessons/1-lesson/images/
   ```
3. **Verify all image references** in lessons point to correct files
4. **Add any missing images** noted during content generation

### Handle Diagrams:

- **Keep** graph structure diagrams (nodes, relationships, data models)
- **Comment out** process flowcharts and UI navigation diagrams
- **Replace** with mermaid only if they add pedagogical value
- **Remove** decorative diagrams that don't enhance understanding

---

## Phase 5: Attribution and Final Review

### Add Source Attribution:

1. **Update REVIEW_SUMMARY.md** with:
   ```markdown
   ## Source Courses

   This workshop combines and adapts content from the following GraphAcademy courses:

   - **[Course Name]** (link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/[slug][Course Link^])
     - Module X: [What was borrowed]
     - Module Y: [What was borrowed]

   - **[Course Name]** (link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/[slug][Course Link^])
     - [What was borrowed]

   All content has been adapted for this workshop's specific goals and context.
   ```

2. **Update README.md** with similar attribution section

## Workshop-Specific Best Practices

### Content Adaptation:

1. **Be Ruthless with Theory**
   - Only include theory that's absolutely necessary
   - Get to hands-on practice quickly
   - "Just enough to do the work" is the goal

2. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Use ONE dataset/domain throughout (e.g., all Northwind)
   - Use ONE set of tools (e.g., all Aura + Data Importer)
   - Keep examples building on each other

3. **Focus on the Goal**
   - Every lesson should move toward the workshop's end goal
   - Remove tangents and "nice to know" content
   - Ask: "Does this help accomplish the workshop goal?"

4. **Practical Over Comprehensive**
   - Show the "happy path" - don't cover every edge case
   - Teach enough to be productive, not to be an expert
   - Reference full courses for deeper learning

### Quality Standards:

- Follow all .cursor/rules/ guidelines
- Proper AsciiDoc formatting (never markdown)
- Two line breaks between elements
- Action-oriented headers in sentence case
- Two-part opening for every lesson
- Summary sections with bullet points
- Source attribution

### Attribution Requirements:

- **Always credit source courses** with links
- Note specific modules/lessons borrowed
- Acknowledge any images or diagrams used
- Mention adaptations made
- Include "Adapted from..." notes where helpful

## Example Workflow

```
User: Create a workshop for importing the Northwind dataset into Neo4j

Assistant (Phase 1): Great! Let me ask some questions:

1. Target Audience: Beginners with no Neo4j experience?
2. Duration: How long? 2-3 hours?
3. What should they accomplish: Import Northwind and run queries?
4. Source courses: Use modeling-fundamentals, importing-fundamentals, neo4j-fundamentals?
5. Format: Self-paced or instructor-led? With slides?
6. Images: Copy from source courses or create new?

User: Yes beginners, 2 hours, yes import and query, yes those courses, instructor-led with slides, copy images and replace non-graph diagrams with mermaid
