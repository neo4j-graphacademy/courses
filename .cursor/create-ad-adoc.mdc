# Task

Create a file containing asciidoc attributes that describe the course.  This will appear as a stylized advertisement block on the right-hand menu documentation pages.  It should include a title, description and link text.  


## Example 


Here is a good example for the `drivers-python` course.

```asciidoc
:page-ad-icon: mortarboard
:page-ad-title: Building Neo4j Applications with Python
:page-ad-description: Enroll for free to learn how to build a Neo4j application with Python.
:page-ad-link: https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/drivers-python/?ref=docs-ad-drivers-python
:page-ad-underline-role: button
:page-ad-underline: Enroll now
```

## Important

The `?ref=` URL parameter in the link is important.  It should be `docs-ad-` followed by the folder name for the course.

The file should be called `ad.adoc` and placed in the folder root next to `course.adoc`.
