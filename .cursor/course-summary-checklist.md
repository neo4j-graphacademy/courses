- [ ] **Concrete examples** where appropriate (technologies, tools, concepts)

### ✅ Writing Style

- [ ] **Positive, encouraging tone** celebrating learner achievement
- [ ] **Clear, concise language** appropriate for target audience
- [ ] **Present perfect tense** ("You have learned", "You've mastered")
- [ ] **Consistent terminology** with course content and Neo4j standards

## Advanced Summary Elements

### ✅ Pro Tips Section (Recommended)

- [ ] **Practical advice** beyond course content
- [ ] **Best practices** organized by category
- [ ] **Real-world application tips** for production use
- [ ] **Common gotchas** and how to avoid them

### ✅ Next Steps / Recommendations

- [ ] **"Ready for your next challenge?"** or similar section
- [ ] **Specific course recommendations** with links
- [ ] **Logical learning progression** based on completed course
- [ ] **Alternative learning paths** for different interests/roles

### ✅ External Resources (Optional)

- [ ] **Official documentation links** for deeper learning
- [ ] **Community resources** (forums, Discord, etc.)
- [ ] **Tool-specific guides** and references
- [ ] **Industry resources** relevant to course topics

## Section Organization Patterns

### ✅ Common Section Structures

**Basic Pattern (Simple Courses):**

```
= Course Summary

In this course, you have learned how to:
* Skill 1
* Skill 2
* Skill 3

include::{shared}/resources.adoc[]
```

**Intermediate Pattern (Most Courses):**

```
= Course Summary

Congratulations on completing "[Course Name]"!

== Understanding [Core Concept]

You now know how to:

* Specific skill 1
* Specific skill 2

== Working with [Technology/Tool]

You've mastered:

* Advanced skill 1
* Advanced skill 2

== Ready for your next challenge?

Recommended courses with links...
```

**Advanced Pattern (Complex Courses):**

```
= Course Summary

Congratulations message...

== [Theme 1]
Skills achieved...

== [Theme 2] 
Skills achieved...

== Pro Tips

=== Performance

=== Security

=== Best Practices
