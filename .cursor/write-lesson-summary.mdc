Add a succinct bullet point summary of the information convered in the lesson to the summary section at the bottom of the page.

Write the content in asciidoc, do not use markdown.

Here is an example of a good summary:

```asciidoc
[.summary]
== Summary 

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) consists of several key elements:

* **Servers** - Provide capabilities through tools, resources, and prompt templates in a client-server architecture
* **Clients** - Manage one-to-one connections to servers and request available tools, resources, and prompt templates
* **Hosts** - Applications (like Claude Desktop, Amazon Q, or Cursor) that maintain session state, manage clients, and decide which tools to use

In the next lesson, you will learn how to install your first MCP server.

```

You can also provide a summary in paragraph form if many concepts aren't covered.

```asciidoc
[.summary]
== Lesson Summary

In this lesson you learned how to install the Neo4j Python Driver, create a Driver instance, verify connectivity to your database, and execute your first Cypher statement.

For async applications, link:https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/concurrency/[use the `AsyncGraphDatabase` method].

In the next lesson, you will take a quiz to test your knowledge of installing and creating a driver instance.

```

For instructions on next lesson, check the next file in the directory ordered alphabetically.  If that file exists, use the content of the file to write a short summary.  If the file is empty or you cannot find a file in the filesystem, feel free to suggest a next lesson and add a `// TODO:` comment above.  If the lesson is a challenge, use an assertive statement like "you will open a can of worms using the can of worms extraction methodology."
