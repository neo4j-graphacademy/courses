# Fact-Checking Lesson Content

Use this guide when fact-checking course content against official Neo4j documentation.

## Process

1. **Read the lesson content** to identify key claims, metrics, features, and recommendations

2. **Use the Neo4j Documentation MCP** to verify information:

   - Use `mcp_neo4j-docs_read_page` to read specific documentation pages
   - Use `mcp_neo4j-docs_list_manual_pages` to find relevant pages in a manual
   - Available manuals include: `aura`, `operations-manual`, `cypher-manual`, `graph-data-science`, etc.

3. **Check these key areas**:

   - Metric names and descriptions
   - Feature availability (which Neo4j versions)
   - Technical specifications
   - Official recommendations and thresholds
   - API syntax and parameters

4. **Categorize findings**:
   - ✅ **Accurate** - Directly confirmed by documentation
   - ⚠️ **Needs clarification** - Correct but could be more precise
   - ❓ **Unverified** - Not found in docs (may be best practices)
   - ❌ **Incorrect** - Contradicts documentation

## Handling Best Practice Recommendations

When lesson content includes specific thresholds or recommendations NOT found in official documentation:

- Frame them as **general guidelines** or **recommendations**, not absolute rules
- Use language like:
  - "As a general guideline..."
  - "For example..."
  - "These thresholds will vary depending on your specific use case..."
- Avoid parentheses for examples - use commas instead
- Make it clear these are starting points, not hard requirements

### Example Transformations

**Before:**

```
Failed queries should be very low, typically less than 1% of total queries.
```

**After:**

```
As a general guideline, failed queries should be very low, typically less than 1% of total queries.
```

**Before:**

```
A low 50th percentile (under 100ms) indicates typical queries are fast.
```

**After:**

```
A low 50th percentile, for example under 100ms, generally indicates typical queries are fast.
```

**Before:**

```
Set latency targets based on your use case, such as under 100ms for user-facing queries.
```

**After:**

```
Set latency targets based on your specific use case, for example under 100ms for user-facing queries. These thresholds will vary depending on your application requirements and user expectations.
```

## Report Format

Provide a clear summary with:

1. Accurate information (what's confirmed)
2. Minor clarifications needed
3. Unverified recommendations (best practices not in docs)
4. Specific edits made or recommended
5. Documentation sources consulted

## Tools to Use

- `mcp_neo4j-docs_read_page` - Read a specific documentation page
- `mcp_neo4j-docs_list_manual_pages` - List all pages in a manual
- `mcp_neo4j-docs_read_course` - Read GraphAcademy course content
- `codebase_search` - Find related content in other lessons
- `grep` - Search for specific terms or patterns
