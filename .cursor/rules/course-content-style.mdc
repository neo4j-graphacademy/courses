## Tone and Voice

### Use Direct Instructional Language
Replace passive or optional phrasing with direct instructions.

Bad:
- "You can create a dashboard..."
- "If you want to change the styling..."
- "You will learn how to access dashboards, import data, and create cards."

Good:
- "Create a dashboard..."
- "To change the styling..."
- "You will learn how to:\n* Access dashboards\n* Import data\n* Create cards"

### Avoid Marketing Language
Do not use words like "powerful", "core feature", "with confidence", or similar marketing terms.

Bad:
- "The powerful Explore tool..."
- "This core feature allows..."
- "You can now confidently design dashboards!"

Good:
- "The Explore tool..."
- "This feature allows..."
- "You are now ready to design dashboards."

### Remove Filler Phrases
Remove or rephrase these phrases:
- "Think about..." → Provide direct explanation
- "Think of..." → Use "serves as" or describe directly
- "otherwise" → Rephrase to be more specific
- "to do this" → Remove or rephrase

## Terminology

### Neo4j Aura Terminology
- Use "instance" instead of "database" when referring to Aura deployments
- Use "Self-Managed" instead of "on-premises" or "on-prem"
- Do not use "integrated" before tool names (e.g., "Query tool" not "integrated Query tool")
- Use "tier" instead of "platform" when referring to pricing/service levels

### Consistent Naming
- AuraDB Free, AuraDB Professional, AuraDB Business Critical, AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud
- Query tool, Explore tool, Import tool, Dashboards tool
- Use "Availability Zone" instead of "AZ" (never use "AZ" as an acronym)
- Use "Virtual Dedicated Cloud" instead of "VDC" (never use "VDC" as an acronym)

### Acronym Usage
**Acronyms must be defined on first use before they can be used standalone.**

Bad:
```
Business Critical provides multi-AZ clusters for high availability.
You can use VDC when you need dedicated infrastructure.
```

Good:
```
Business Critical provides multi-Availability Zone clusters for high availability.
You can use Virtual Dedicated Cloud (VDC) when you need dedicated infrastructure. After the first use, you can use VDC.
```

**Rule:** Always write out the full term on first use. If you need to use an acronym repeatedly, define it in parentheses on first use, then you can use the acronym afterward.

**Exceptions:** Common, well-known acronyms that don't need definition:
- API (Application Programming Interface)
- UI (User Interface)
- CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
- HTTP/HTTPS
- AWS, GCP, Azure (cloud provider names)

## Quiz Guidelines

### Hints Must Be Explanatory
Quiz hints should directly explain the answer, not tell users to "think about" something.

Bad:
```
[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Think about the features and limitations of each tier.
====
```

Good:
```
[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
AuraDB Free provides a fully managed Neo4j instance with limited resources at no cost, making it ideal for learning and experimentation.
====
```

### Quiz Topics Must Be Covered in Lesson
Every quiz question must test content that is explicitly covered in the lesson. If a quiz topic is not covered, either:
1. Add the missing content to the lesson, or
2. Move the quiz to the appropriate lesson

## Lesson Structure

### "You will learn how to" Format
Convert inline lists to bulleted lists.

Bad:
```
In this lesson, you will learn how to access Aura Dashboards, import data, and create cards.
```

Good:
```
In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Access Aura Dashboards
* Import data
* Create cards
```

### Summary References
Lesson summaries should reference what comes next using bulleted lists.

Bad:
```
In the next lesson, you will learn how to describe your data model and design dashboards.
```

Good:
```
In the next lesson, you will learn how to:

* Describe your data model
* Design dashboards that align with stakeholder requirements
```

## AsciiDoc Numbered Lists

### Use Dot Notation for Ordered Lists
Use `.` for ordered list items, not explicit numbers.

Bad:
```
1. First step
2. Second step

image::images/step2.png[]

[start=3]
. Third step
```

Good:
```
. First step
. Second step
+
image::images/step2.png[]

. Third step
```

### List Continuation
Use `+` to continue list items with images or code blocks.

```
. Click the **Share** button
+
image::images/share-button.png[Share button]

. Enter the email addresses
```

## Content Organization

### Welcome Messages
**"Welcome to this course" should only appear in `course.adoc`, never in modules or lessons.**

Bad:
```
// In course.adoc
Welcome to the Neo4j Dashboards course on GraphAcademy!

// In module.adoc
Welcome to the Getting Started module!

// In lesson.adoc
Welcome to the Neo4j Dashboards course on GraphAcademy!
```

Good:
```
// In course.adoc only
Welcome to the Neo4j Dashboards course on GraphAcademy!

// In module.adoc - no welcome message
== Module Overview
This module introduces Neo4j Dashboards...

// In lesson.adoc - no welcome message
== What are Neo4j Dashboards?
Neo4j Dashboards is a tool for visualizing...
```

### Avoid Content Repetition
Do not repeat content from `course.adoc` in modules or lessons unless it's necessary for context.

* Course introduction belongs in `course.adoc` only
* Module overviews should not repeat course-level information
* Lessons should not repeat module-level information
* Each level should build on the previous, not repeat it

## Link Formatting

### Documentation Links with Captions
When listing prerequisite courses or documentation links, include descriptive captions.

Bad:
```
* link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^]
* link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^]
```

Good:
```
* link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^] - Learn the basics of graph databases
* link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] - Learn the Cypher query language
```
