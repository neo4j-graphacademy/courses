## Tone and Voice

### Use Direct Instructional Language
Replace passive or optional phrasing with direct instructions.

Bad:
- "You can create a dashboard..."
- "If you want to change the styling..."
- "You will learn how to access dashboards, import data, and create cards."

Good:
- "Create a dashboard..."
- "To change the styling..."
- "You will learn how to:\n* Access dashboards\n* Import data\n* Create cards"

### Avoid Marketing Language
Do not use words like "powerful", "core feature", "with confidence", or similar marketing terms.

Bad:
- "The powerful Explore tool..."
- "This core feature allows..."
- "You can now confidently design dashboards!"

Good:
- "The Explore tool..."
- "This feature allows..."
- "You are now ready to design dashboards."

### Remove Filler Phrases
Remove or rephrase these phrases:
- "Think about..." → Provide direct explanation
- "Think of..." → Use "serves as" or describe directly
- "otherwise" → Rephrase to be more specific
- "to do this" → Remove or rephrase

## Terminology

### Neo4j Aura Terminology
- Use "instance" instead of "database" when referring to Aura deployments
- Use "Self-Managed" instead of "on-premises" or "on-prem"
- Do not use "integrated" before tool names (e.g., "Query tool" not "integrated Query tool")
- Use "tier" instead of "platform" when referring to pricing/service levels

### Consistent Naming
- AuraDB Free, AuraDB Professional, AuraDB Business Critical, AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud
- Query tool, Explore tool, Import tool, Dashboards tool

## Quiz Guidelines

### Hints Must Be Explanatory
Quiz hints should directly explain the answer, not tell users to "think about" something.

Bad:
```
[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Think about the features and limitations of each tier.
====
```

Good:
```
[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
AuraDB Free provides a fully managed Neo4j instance with limited resources at no cost, making it ideal for learning and experimentation.
====
```

### Quiz Topics Must Be Covered in Lesson
Every quiz question must test content that is explicitly covered in the lesson. If a quiz topic is not covered, either:
1. Add the missing content to the lesson, or
2. Move the quiz to the appropriate lesson

## Lesson Structure

### "You will learn how to" Format
Convert inline lists to bulleted lists.

Bad:
```
In this lesson, you will learn how to access Aura Dashboards, import data, and create cards.
```

Good:
```
In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Access Aura Dashboards
* Import data
* Create cards
```

### Summary References
Lesson summaries should reference what comes next using bulleted lists.

Bad:
```
In the next lesson, you will learn how to describe your data model and design dashboards.
```

Good:
```
In the next lesson, you will learn how to:

* Describe your data model
* Design dashboards that align with stakeholder requirements
```

## AsciiDoc Numbered Lists

### Use Dot Notation for Ordered Lists
Use `.` for ordered list items, not explicit numbers.

Bad:
```
1. First step
2. Second step

image::images/step2.png[]

[start=3]
. Third step
```

Good:
```
. First step
. Second step
+
image::images/step2.png[]

. Third step
```

### List Continuation
Use `+` to continue list items with images or code blocks.

```
. Click the **Share** button
+
image::images/share-button.png[Share button]

. Enter the email addresses
```

## Link Formatting

### Documentation Links with Captions
When listing prerequisite courses or documentation links, include descriptive captions.

Bad:
```
* link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^]
* link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^]
```

Good:
```
* link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^] - Learn the basics of graph databases
* link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] - Learn the Cypher query language
```
