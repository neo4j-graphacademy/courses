## Video Formatting Rules

### Videos Support Content

**Videos should support the content you've already written, not require their own explanations.**

The written content should explain what to do and why. Videos demonstrate the actions visually, reinforcing the instructions.

### Format

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Step Title

Write clear instructions explaining what to do and why it matters.

video::url["Video Title", role="cdn", width=100%]

Continue with any additional context or next steps that build on what the video demonstrated.
```

### Best Practices

- **Content first** - Write clear instructions before the video
- **Videos demonstrate** - Videos show the actions described in the content
- **No redundant explanations** - Don't add "What this video shows" or "What happened" if the content already explains it
- **One video per slide** when possible
- **Use slide breaks** - Separate videos into distinct learning moments
- **Natural flow** - Place videos where they naturally support the instructional content

### Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't do this:**
```asciidoc
**What this video shows:** How to add a node label to your data model.

video::url["Add Node Label", role="cdn", width=100%]

**What happened:** The video demonstrated creating a Movie node label.
```

✅ **Do this instead:**
```asciidoc
Click the **Add node label** button and set the label to **Movie**. This creates Movie nodes that your queries can traverse.

video::url["Add Node Label", role="cdn", width=100%]

After adding the label, you can edit the model structure to refine how your CSV data maps to graph elements.
```

### When Videos Are Consecutive

If you need multiple videos in sequence, ensure the content between them explains the connection:

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Step 1: Add Movie nodes

Click the **Add node label** button and set the label to **Movie**.

video::url1["Add Node Label", role="cdn", width=100%]

[.slide]
== Step 2: Edit the model

After adding the label, edit the model structure to refine how your CSV data maps to graph elements.

video::url2["Edit Data Model", role="cdn", width=100%]
```
