## Video Formatting Rules

### Consecutive Videos

**Never place two videos one after another without explanation.**

When multiple videos are needed to demonstrate a workflow:

1. **Add explanatory text before each video** explaining what it demonstrates
2. **Add explanatory text between videos** explaining how they connect
3. **Use slide breaks** to separate videos into distinct learning moments

### Format

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Step Title

**What this video shows:** Brief explanation of what the learner will see.

video::url["Video Title", role="cdn", width=100%]

**What happened:** Brief explanation of what the video demonstrated and why it matters.

[.slide]
== Next Step

**How this connects:** Explanation of how this video relates to the previous one.

video::url["Next Video Title", role="cdn", width=100%]
```

### Best Practices

- **One video per slide** when possible
- **Explain before showing** - Tell learners what they'll see
- **Explain after showing** - Reinforce what they learned
- **Connect videos** - Explain how consecutive videos relate to each other
- **Use slide breaks** - Separate videos into distinct learning moments

### Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't do this:**
```asciidoc
video::url1["Video 1"]
video::url2["Video 2"]
```

✅ **Do this instead:**
```asciidoc
**What this video shows:** How to add a node label to your data model.

video::url1["Add Node Label", role="cdn", width=100%]

**What happened:** The video showed how to create a Movie node. Next, you'll learn how to edit the model structure.

**What this video shows:** How to edit your data model after creating nodes.

video::url2["Edit Data Model", role="cdn", width=100%]
```
