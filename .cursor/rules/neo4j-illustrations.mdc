## Neo4j Illustration Guidelines

Reference: https://neo4j.design/40a8cff71/p/70518c-illustrations

### Illustration Style

1. **Clean and minimal** - Avoid visual clutter; focus on the essential elements
2. **Consistent line weight** - Use 2px strokes for primary elements, 1px for secondary
3. **Rounded corners** - Use border-radius of 4-8px for shapes
4. **Flat design** - Avoid 3D effects, gradients, and drop shadows

### Color Usage in Illustrations

| Element | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Primary shapes | Mid Baltic | `#014063` |
| Accent/highlight | Lime | `#00CC52` |
| Secondary shapes | Teal | `#006E58` |
| Backgrounds | Light Gray | `#F5F7FA` |
| Text on dark | White | `#FFFFFF` |
| Connecting lines | Slate | `#485662` |

### Diagram Types

**Architecture Diagrams**
- Show system components as rounded rectangles
- Use arrows to indicate data flow direction
- Label all connections clearly
- Group related components with subtle background containers

**Process Flows**
- Use flowchart format with clear start/end points
- Diamond shapes for decision points
- Rectangles for actions/processes
- Keep flow direction consistent (top-to-bottom or left-to-right)

**Comparison Diagrams**
- Use side-by-side layouts
- Maintain visual balance between compared elements
- Use color to differentiate categories

### Icon Usage

- Use simple, recognizable icons
- Maintain consistent icon size within a diagram (24px, 32px, or 48px)
- Icons should be single-color (no multi-colored icons)
- Prefer outlined icons over filled for technical diagrams

### Spacing and Alignment

- Maintain consistent spacing between elements (16px, 24px, or 32px)
- Align elements to a grid
- Center-align text within shapes
- Leave adequate whitespace around diagrams

### Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum for text)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey meaning
- Provide alt text for all images
- Use patterns or labels in addition to colors when differentiating elements
