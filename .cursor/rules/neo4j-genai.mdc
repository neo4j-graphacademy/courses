## Neo4j GenAI Guidelines

Reference: https://neo4j.design/40a8cff71/p/80d226-gen-ai

### Terminology

| Term | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **AI** | Acceptable shorthand for Artificial Intelligence |
| **GenAI** | Generative AI - for content generation features |
| **LLM** | Large Language Model - when technically relevant |
| **Natural Language** | User input in plain English (not Cypher) |
| **AI-assisted** | Features that use AI to help users |
| **AI-generated** | Content created by AI |

### Describing AI Features

**Accurate Expectations**
- Be specific about what AI can and cannot do
- Avoid overpromising ("AI will perfectly understand...")
- Use phrases like "AI-assisted" rather than "AI-powered"

**Example Phrasing:**
- ✅ "Generate queries using AI assistance"
- ✅ "AI can help create initial Cypher queries"
- ❌ "AI will write perfect queries for you"
- ❌ "Let AI handle all your queries"

### AI Feature Documentation

When documenting AI features:

1. **Explain the input** - What the user provides (natural language prompt)
2. **Describe the process** - What the AI does with the input
3. **Show the output** - What the user receives
4. **Note limitations** - When AI might not work well
5. **Provide guidance** - Tips for better results

### Writing About AI-Generated Content

```asciidoc
== Using AI to Generate Queries

Enter a description of what you want to query, and the AI generates Cypher for you.

For example, entering "Find all movies released in 2020" produces:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.released = 2020
RETURN m
----

TIP: Review AI-generated queries before running them. The AI provides a starting point that you may need to refine.
```

### Visual Representation of AI

- Use a sparkle/star icon (✨) to indicate AI features
- Color: Lime (#00CC52) for AI accent elements
- Label AI-generated content clearly

### Tone for AI Content

- **Helpful, not magical** - AI is a tool, not a replacement for understanding
- **Transparent** - Acknowledge that AI has limitations
- **Educational** - Help users learn from AI suggestions
- **Encouraging** - Prompt users to experiment with AI features

### AI in Diagrams

When showing AI in architecture or flow diagrams:

```
User Input --> [AI Processing] --> Generated Output --> User Review
```

- Show AI as a processing step, not an endpoint
- Include human review/validation in the flow
- Use the GenAI icon or sparkle symbol
