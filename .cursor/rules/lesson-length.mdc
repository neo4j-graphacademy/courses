## Lesson Length Guidelines

### Maximum Length

**Lessons should fit within 2-3 full screen scrolls** to maintain learner engagement and prevent cognitive overload.

**Line Count Limits:**
- **Target**: 100-150 lines of AsciiDoc content
- **Maximum**: 200 lines (hard limit - lessons exceeding this must be split)
- **Ideal**: 80-120 lines for optimal readability

### Why This Matters

- **Cognitive Load**: Shorter lessons reduce mental fatigue and improve retention
- **Progress Perception**: Learners feel more accomplished with frequent lesson completions
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Shorter lessons work better on smaller screens
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and review shorter lessons

### How to Measure

1. **Count total lines** in `lesson.adoc` (excluding blank lines at end)
2. **Estimate reading time**: ~1 line per second for average reader
3. **Check slide count**: If using slides, aim for 10-20 slides max

### When to Split a Lesson

Split a lesson if it:
- Exceeds **200 lines** (hard limit)
- Contains **more than 3 major concepts** or topics
- Takes **more than 5 minutes** to read
- Has **more than 20 slides**
- Covers **multiple distinct workflows** that could be separate lessons

### How to Split Lessons

**Option 1: Split by Workflow Steps**
- Lesson 1: "Preparing your data" (steps 1-3)
- Lesson 2: "Creating your model" (steps 4-6)
- Lesson 3: "Running the import" (steps 7-11)

**Option 2: Split by Concepts**
- Lesson 1: "Understanding the tool" (concept introduction)
- Lesson 2: "Using the tool" (hands-on steps)

**Option 3: Split by Complexity**
- Lesson 1: "Basic usage" (simple case)
- Lesson 2: "Advanced features" (complex scenarios)

### Examples

**Good Lesson Length:**
- 120 lines: Covers one concept with clear steps
- 95 lines: Focused topic with examples
- 150 lines: Comprehensive but still digestible

**Too Long (Needs Splitting):**
- 400 lines: Multiple concepts, should be 2-3 lessons
- 300 lines: Too many steps, split by workflow
- 250 lines: Multiple topics, split by concept

### Checklist

Before finalizing a lesson:
- [ ] Lesson is under 200 lines (hard limit)
- [ ] Lesson is ideally 100-150 lines
- [ ] Lesson covers 1-2 concepts maximum
- [ ] Lesson can be read in under 5 minutes
- [ ] If using slides, lesson has 10-20 slides max
- [ ] Lesson has a clear, single learning objective

### Enforcement

- **Automated Check**: Run `find . -name "lesson.adoc" -exec wc -l {} \;` to check all lessons
- **Pre-commit**: Consider adding a check that flags lessons over 200 lines
- **Review Process**: During course review, flag lessons that exceed limits
