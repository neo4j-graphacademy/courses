## Lesson Length Guidelines

### Topic Limits

**Lessons should introduce a maximum of 3 topics** to maintain learner engagement and prevent cognitive overload.

**Word Count Guidelines:**
- **Average per topic**: 200 words (±50 words, so 150-250 words per topic)
- **Maximum lesson length**: 750 words (3 topics × 250 words)
- **Minimum lesson length**: 450 words (3 topics × 150 words)
- **Ideal lesson length**: 600 words (3 topics × 200 words)

### Why This Matters

- **Cognitive Load**: Limiting topics reduces mental fatigue and improves retention
- **Progress Perception**: Learners feel more accomplished with frequent lesson completions
- **Focused Learning**: Fewer topics per lesson allow deeper understanding
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and review lessons with clear topic boundaries

### How to Measure

1. **Count topics**: Identify distinct concepts or topics in the lesson (maximum 3)
2. **Count words per topic**: Use word count tool to measure each topic section
3. **Verify balance**: Ensure each topic has 150-250 words (average 200 words)
4. **Check total**: Total lesson should be 450-750 words

### When to Split a Lesson

Split a lesson if it:
- Contains **more than 3 topics** (hard limit)
- Any topic exceeds **250 words** (consider splitting that topic into its own lesson)
- Total lesson exceeds **750 words** (likely contains more than 3 topics)
- Covers **multiple distinct workflows** that could be separate lessons

### How to Split Lessons

**Option 1: Split by Topics**
- Lesson 1: Topic 1 (150-250 words)
- Lesson 2: Topic 2 (150-250 words)
- Lesson 3: Topic 3 (150-250 words)

**Option 2: Split by Workflow Steps**
- Lesson 1: "Preparing your data" (2-3 topics, 450-750 words)
- Lesson 2: "Creating your model" (2-3 topics, 450-750 words)
- Lesson 3: "Running the import" (2-3 topics, 450-750 words)

**Option 3: Split by Complexity**
- Lesson 1: "Basic concepts" (3 topics, 450-750 words)
- Lesson 2: "Advanced features" (3 topics, 450-750 words)

### Examples

**Good Lesson Structure:**
- 3 topics × 200 words = 600 words: Well-balanced lesson
- 2 topics × 225 words = 450 words: Focused lesson with adequate depth
- 3 topics × 180 words = 540 words: Concise but complete

**Too Long (Needs Splitting):**
- 4+ topics: Exceeds maximum, split into multiple lessons
- 1 topic with 400+ words: Split the topic into subtopics
- 3 topics but 900+ words: Topics are too long, reduce word count per topic

### Checklist

Before finalizing a lesson:
- [ ] Lesson contains maximum 3 topics (hard limit)
- [ ] Each topic has 150-250 words (average 200 words)
- [ ] Total lesson is 450-750 words
- [ ] Each topic has a clear learning objective
- [ ] Topics are logically connected and build on each other
- [ ] Lesson can be read in under 5 minutes

### Enforcement

- **Automated Check**: Use word count tool to verify topic and total word counts
- **Pre-commit**: Consider adding a check that flags lessons with more than 3 topics or exceeding 750 words
- **Review Process**: During course review, verify topic count and word distribution
