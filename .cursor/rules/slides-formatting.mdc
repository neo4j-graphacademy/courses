# Slides Formatting Guide

## What are Slides?

Slides are a presentation-style formatting system used in GraphAcademy lessons for **instructor-led training**. They render content in a **16:9 aspect ratio** presentation format, transforming traditional long-form content into visually engaging, digestible slides.

Each slide represents a single concept, section, or topic that can be displayed independently during training sessions, similar to presentation slides in PowerPoint or Google Slides.

**Important**: Slides are ONLY for theory lessons (`:type: lesson`). Challenge lessons (`:type: challenge`) are designed for learners to read and work through independently, so they should NOT have slide formatting.

## How Slides Work

Slides are implemented using AsciiDoc role markers (`[.slide]`) applied to section headers. These markers tell the rendering system to treat the content as a separate slide unit.

### Basic Syntax

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Section Title

Content goes here. This will be rendered as a single slide.
```

### Slide Modifiers

Slides support various modifiers that can be chained together:

- **`.discrete`**: Removes the section from the table of contents/navigation
- **`.col-2`**: Creates a two-column layout for content and images (or two text columns)
- **`.reverse`**: Reverses the HTML flow order (image appears above text in linear reading, but stays on right in slide view)
- **`.overflow-hidden`**: Hides overflow content (useful for images)

### Content Visibility

- **`.transcript-only`**: Content wrapper that appears only in transcripts, not on slides (use for complex tables, detailed data)
- **`[TIP,role=transcript-only]`**: Hides tip boxes from slides but keeps them in transcripts

**Example with multiple modifiers:**

```asciidoc
[.slide.discrete.overflow-hidden.col-2]
=== Subsection Title
```

## Rules for Applying Slides

### 1. Text-Only Sections

**Apply `[.slide]` to:**

- Sections containing only text content
- Lists and bullet points
- Code blocks
- Tables without accompanying images

**Example:**

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Snapshot Types

Aura provides two types of snapshots to help you protect your data.

A **full snapshot** captures your entire database at a specific point in time.

A **differential snapshot** only records the changes since the last full snapshot.
```

### 2. Text + Image Sections (Two-Column Layout)

**Apply `[.slide.col-2]` when:**

- Content includes an image that should be displayed alongside text
- The image is medium to large size (typically screenshots, diagrams)
- Content length is SHORT TO MEDIUM (1-4 paragraphs or bullet points)

**Structure:**

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2]
== Section Title

[.col]
====
Text content goes in the first column.

This can include multiple paragraphs, lists, or other content.
====

[.col]
====
image::images/screenshot.png[Alt text]
====
```

### 3. Reverse Layout (Image First in Flow, Right in Slides)

**Apply `[.slide.col-2.reverse]` when:**

- The image is a screenshot or opening diagram that provides essential context
- The image should appear ABOVE the content in linear/flow reading (for learners reading through)
- But the image should remain on the RIGHT in the 16:9 slide presentation view (for instructors)
- This is typically used when the visual context is essential before reading the explanation
- **Can be used even with wide images** - the image will scale to fit the column in slide view

**Important:** `.reverse` affects the HTML flow order (top-to-bottom), NOT the slide column positions. In slide view, images still appear on the right.

**Example:**

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2.reverse]
== Restore from Backup File

[.col]
====
image::images/restore-from-backup-file.png[Restore interface]
====

[.col]
====
You can use the **Restore from backup file** tab to upload a previously exported backup file.

Supported formats:
* `.backup` files (latest version)
* `.dump` files (version 4.x)
====
```

In this example, when reading linearly, the image appears first (giving context), but in the 16:9 slide presentation, it displays on the right.

### 4. Subsections: Full Slides vs. Discrete

**When to use full `[.slide]` for subsections (===):**

- The subsection introduces a NEW major concept that deserves navigation visibility
- Content is substantial enough to stand alone
- You want the subsection to appear in the lesson navigation/TOC
- Especially when there are ONLY 2-3 main subsections that divide a topic

**When to use `[.slide.discrete]`:**

- Multiple small subsections that would clutter navigation
- Sub-subsections (==== and deeper)
- Content that elaborates on a parent topic
- Step-by-step progressions where you want slides but not TOC entries

**Example of full slide subsections:**

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Comparing summary and details views

* **Summary view** - groups identical queries together
* **Details view** - shows individual executions

[.slide]
=== Summary View

Content about summary view...

[.slide]
=== Details View

Content about details view...
```

**Example of discrete subsections:**

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2.discrete]
=== Restore from a Snapshot

[.col]
====
Click on the arrow icon to restore the snapshot.
====

[.col]
====
image::images/restore-from-snapshot-confirm.png[Confirmation dialog]
====
```

### 5. Two-Column Text Layouts

**Apply `[.slide.col-2]` for text-only layouts when:**

- You have two related subsections that are SHORT and complementary
- Content in each column is roughly balanced
- Each column contains a subsection (===) with related content
- The two topics work better side-by-side for comparison or balance

**Example:**

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2]
== Measuring Improvement

[.col]
=== Before and After Comparison

Steps and calculations...
====

[.col]
====
=== Validate with Query Logs

Verification steps...
====
```

### 6. Small Inline Images

**Do NOT use `.col-2` for:**

- Small icons (typically < 50px wide)
- Inline UI elements
- Images that appear mid-sentence

**Keep inline:**

```asciidoc
The arrow icon image:images/restore-from-snapshot.png[Restore icon] allows you to restore the snapshot.
```

## Content Length Considerations

### Short Content (1-2 sentences or a small list)

- Use `[.slide.col-2]` with image if visual is important
- Content should fit comfortably in a column without scrolling

### Medium Content (3-5 paragraphs or moderate list)

- Use `[.slide.col-2]` if image enhances understanding
- Ensure text column doesn't become too long relative to image

### Long Content (6+ paragraphs, large tables, multiple code blocks)

- Use standard `[.slide]` even if an image is present
- Place image below content or break into multiple slides
- Consider splitting into multiple shorter slides

## Image Size Guidelines

### Determining Layout by Image Aspect Ratio

Since slides render in a **16:9 aspect ratio**, use the image's aspect ratio (width:height) to determine the best layout, not absolute pixel dimensions.

**Small Icons (aspect ratio ~1:1, typically UI elements):**

- Keep inline with text
- Do NOT use `.col-2`
- Examples: arrows, buttons, small badges

**Square to Slightly Wide Images (aspect ratio 1:1 to 4:3):**

- Ideal for `[.slide.col-2]` layout
- Fits well in a column on 16:9 slides
- Examples: dialog boxes, compact screenshots, square diagrams

**Wide Images (aspect ratio 16:9 to 16:10 - typical screenshots):**

- **Can use `[.slide.col-2.reverse]` layout** - image scales to fit column in 16:9 slides
- Image appears above text in linear reading, on right in slide view
- Text should be concise (bullet points or short paragraphs)
- Details may be harder to read but context is maintained

**Very Wide Images (aspect ratio > 2:1 - full browser screenshots):**

- Can still use `[.slide.col-2.reverse]` if text is brief and image provides essential context
- OR use standard `[.slide]` with image below text if details are critical
- Test readability in 16:9 format - prioritize instructor presentation needs

**Tall/Portrait Images (aspect ratio < 3:4):**

- Excellent for `.col-2` layout
- Can balance longer text in the other column
- Examples: mobile screenshots, tall dialog boxes, vertical workflows

## Best Practices

1. **Think 16:9 Presentation**: Remember slides are for instructor-led training in 16:9 format - design for that context

2. **Consistency**: Apply slides consistently throughout a lesson - don't mix slide and non-slide content arbitrarily

3. **One Concept Per Slide**: Each slide should cover a single concept, action, or topic

4. **Balance**: In `.col-2` layouts, aim for visual balance between columns (text and image should be roughly similar height)

5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Use multiple slides to break down complex topics rather than cramming everything into one long slide

6. **Discrete for Sub-topics**: Use `.discrete` for subsections that elaborate on a parent topic but don't need separate navigation entries

7. **Image Aspect Ratios**: Check image aspect ratios to determine if they'll work well in a column on 16:9 slides

8. **Use Reverse for Context**: Apply `.reverse` when an image provides essential context that should appear first in linear reading flow

9. **Test Readability**: After applying slides, review the rendered 16:9 output to ensure text and images are readable and well-balanced

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Introduction Slide

```asciidoc
[.slide.discrete]
== Introduction

Brief overview of what will be covered in this lesson.
```

### Pattern 2: Concept with Visual

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2]
== Understanding Feature X

[.col]
====
Explanation of the feature and how it works.
====

[.col]
====
image::images/feature-x.png[Feature X interface]
====
```

### Pattern 3: Step-by-Step Instructions

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2]
== Accessing the Feature

[.col]
====
To access this feature:

1. Navigate to the main console
2. Click the menu icon
3. Select the option
====

[.col]
====
image::images/menu-selection.png[Menu with option highlighted]
====
```

### Pattern 4: Multiple Related Slides

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2]
== Main Topic

[.col]
====
Initial content and context.
====

[.col]
====
image::images/overview.png[Overview]
====

[.slide.col-2.discrete]
=== Specific Detail

[.col]
====
Detailed explanation continuing the main topic.
====

[.col]
====
image::images/detail.png[Detail view]
====
```

### Pattern 5: Wide Image with Context (Using .reverse)

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2.reverse]
== Understanding the Interface

[.col]
====
image::images/wide-screenshot.png[Interface screenshot]
====

[.col]
====
Key features of the interface:

* Feature A - does X
* Feature B - does Y
* Feature C - does Z

This layout helps you understand the visual context.
====
```

### Pattern 6: Two-Column Text Layout

```asciidoc
[.slide.col-2]
== Process Steps

[.col]
=== Preparation

1. Gather requirements
2. Review data
3. Plan approach
====

[.col]
====
=== Execution

1. Implement changes
2. Test thoroughly
3. Validate results
====
```

### Pattern 7: Hiding Complex Details

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Available Filters

[.transcript-only]
====
The following filters are available:
====

[cols="2,4,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Filter | Description | Type | Example
| ... complex table that's discussed verbally ...
|===

[TIP,role=transcript-only]
.Advanced Usage
====
Detailed code examples and tips for transcript readers...
====
```

## Hiding Complex Content from Slides

Use **`.transcript-only`** to hide content that doesn't work well in slide format:

### When to Hide Content

**Complex tables with many columns:**

```asciidoc
[.slide]
== Filtering query logs

[.transcript-only]
====
You can filter query logs by the following criteria:
====

[cols="2,4,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Filter | Description | Type | Example
... detailed table ...
|===
```

**Detailed tip boxes:**

```asciidoc
[TIP,role=transcript-only]
.Setting a custom application name
====
Detailed code examples and explanations...
====
```

**Why hide this content:**

- Complex tables are hard to read on slides - discuss verbally instead
- Detailed tip boxes distract from main teaching points
- Code examples in tips are better in transcript for reference
- Keeps slides focused on key concepts for instructor presentation

## When NOT to Use Slides

Do not apply slide formatting to:

- **Challenge lessons** (`:type: challenge` in frontmatter) - these are for learners to read independently
- Quiz sections (marked with `[.quiz]`)
- Summary sections (marked with `[.summary]`)
- Questions includes (these have their own formatting)
- Collapsible content blocks (`[%collapsible]`)

## Migration Checklist

When converting existing content to slides:

- [ ] **Check lesson type**: Only apply slides to `:type: lesson` - SKIP `:type: challenge` lessons entirely
- [ ] Identify natural content breaks (one concept per slide)
- [ ] Mark text-only sections with `[.slide]`
- [ ] Check each image aspect ratio and content length
- [ ] Apply `[.slide.col-2]` or `[.slide.col-2.reverse]` for images (even wide ones work)
- [ ] Consider `.reverse` when image provides essential context that should appear first in linear flow
- [ ] Decide if subsections should be full `[.slide]` (for navigation) or `[.slide.discrete]` (hidden from TOC)
- [ ] Wrap complex tables in `[.transcript-only]` blocks if they don't present well on slides
- [ ] Mark detailed tips as `[TIP,role=transcript-only]` if they're better for reading
- [ ] Consider `[.slide.col-2]` for two related text subsections that complement each other
- [ ] Test rendered 16:9 output for balance and readability
- [ ] Verify images remain readable when displayed in columns
- [ ] Ensure consistency across the entire lesson
