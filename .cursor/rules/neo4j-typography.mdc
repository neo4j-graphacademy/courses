## Neo4j Typography Guidelines

Reference: https://neo4j.design/40a8cff71/p/85a15c-typography

### Font Families

| Usage | Font | Fallback |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Headings** | Nunito Sans | sans-serif |
| **Body Text** | Open Sans | sans-serif |
| **Code/Monospace** | Fira Code, Source Code Pro | monospace |

### Heading Hierarchy

| Level | Size | Weight | Usage |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| H1 | 32px | Bold (700) | Page titles, course names |
| H2 | 24px | Bold (700) | Section headers |
| H3 | 20px | Semi-bold (600) | Subsection headers |
| H4 | 18px | Semi-bold (600) | Minor sections |
| Body | 16px | Regular (400) | Paragraph text |
| Small | 14px | Regular (400) | Captions, hints |

### Section Title Guidelines

Use **gerund (-ing) form** for section titles that describe actions or processes:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Create an instance" | "Creating an instance" |
| "Connect to your database" | "Connecting to your database" |
| "Import data" | "Importing data" |
| "Manage your instance" | "Managing your instance" |
| "Understand costs" | "Understanding costs" |

**Exceptions** (use noun phrases):
- Conceptual sections: "What is Neo4j Aura?", "The cost structure"
- Reference sections: "Summary", "Prerequisites", "Check your understanding"
- Named features: "Aura Tiers", "Data Importer service"

### Writing Style

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Use plain language that technical and non-technical readers understand
2. **Active voice** - Write "Create an instance" not "An instance should be created"
3. **Instructional vs. Informative tone** - Choose phrasing based on the learning objective and action required:
   * **Direct imperative for required actions** - Use when the learner must perform the action to complete the lesson or task. This creates clear, actionable steps: "Click the button" or "Enter your credentials" or "Run the query"
   * **"You can" for optional alternatives** - Use when presenting additional capabilities or alternative approaches that enhance understanding but aren't required. This informs learners about options without mandating action: "You can view and change settings in the preferences menu" or "You can also connect using a different authentication method"
   * **"To [action]" for informative guidance** - Use when explaining how to accomplish something that provides context while still being instructional. This format introduces the purpose before the action: "To change your instance name, click the edit icon" or "To connect to your database, enter the connection URI in the dialog"
4. **Consistent terminology** - Use the same terms throughout (instance, not database/instance interchangeably)
5. **Avoid ambiguous references** - Replace "This is..." or "That is..." with specific subjects
6. **Lesson introductions** - Use "In the previous lesson" when the topic was actually covered in the previous lesson. Use "So far in this course" when providing broader context that spans multiple lessons or when the connection isn't directly from the previous lesson.

### Phrases to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "This is perfect for..." | "[Feature/Action] works well for..." |
| "This is useful when..." | "[Feature] helps when..." or "Use [feature] when..." |
| "That is already there" | Rephrase with specific subject |
| "with confidence" | Remove or rephrase |
| "confidently" | Remove or rephrase |
| "you can now" | Remove "now" or rephrase |
| "Now that you..." | Start directly with the next action |
| "Think of X as..." | "X serves as..." or "X functions as..." |
| "integrated" (for built-in tools) | Remove or use "built-in" |
| "powerful" | Be specific about capabilities |
| "core feature" | Describe the actual functionality |
| "Day 0" | "at creation time" or "fixed at creation" |
| "Neo4j's cloud platform" | "a fully managed DBaaS where Neo4j manages the cloud infrastructure" |
| "cloud platform" (for Aura) | "managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)" |
| "X vs. Y" or "X versus Y" | Use instructional phrasing: "Understand which settings are fixed at creation and which can be changed later" or "X and Y" for comparisons |

### Avoiding "vs" Comparisons

Avoid using "vs" or "versus" in section titles and content. Instead, use instructional phrasing that explains the relationship or differences:

**For comparisons:**
- ❌ "Scheduled vs on-demand snapshots"
- ✅ "Scheduled and on-demand snapshots" or "Understanding scheduled and on-demand snapshots"

**For explaining differences:**
- ❌ "Fixed vs changeable settings"
- ✅ "Fixed and changeable settings" or "Understand which settings are fixed at creation and which can be changed later"

**For tool comparisons:**
- ❌ "Query vs Explore"
- ✅ "Query and Explore tools" or "Understanding when to use Query and Explore"

**For choosing between options:**
- ❌ "When to use AuraDB vs. self-managed Neo4j"
- ✅ "When to use AuraDB or self-managed Neo4j" or "Understanding when to use AuraDB and self-managed Neo4j"

**Exception:** Proper nouns like "VS Code" (Visual Studio Code) are acceptable.

### Acronym Usage

**Acronyms must be defined on first use before they can be used standalone.**

**Rules:**
- Always write out the full term on first use
- If you need to use an acronym repeatedly, define it in parentheses on first use, then you can use the acronym afterward
- Use "Availability Zone" instead of "AZ" (never use "AZ" as an acronym)
- Use "Virtual Dedicated Cloud" instead of "VDC" (never use "VDC" as an acronym unless defined first)

**Examples:**

Bad:
```
Business Critical provides multi-AZ clusters for high availability.
You can use VDC when you need dedicated infrastructure.
```

Good:
```
Business Critical provides multi-Availability Zone clusters for high availability.
You can use Virtual Dedicated Cloud (VDC) when you need dedicated infrastructure. After the first use, you can use VDC.
```

**Exceptions:** Common, well-known acronyms that don't need definition:
- API (Application Programming Interface)
- UI (User Interface)
- CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
- HTTP/HTTPS
- AWS, GCP, Azure (cloud provider names)
- RBAC (if defined earlier in the course)
- SSO (if defined earlier in the course)

### Text Formatting

- **Bold** for UI elements: Click **Create Instance**
- *Italic* for emphasis or introducing new terms
- `Monospace` for code, commands, file names, and technical values
- Use sentence case for headings (capitalize first word only)

### Line Length

- Aim for 60-80 characters per line for readability
- Break long paragraphs into shorter ones (3-4 sentences max)

### Lists

- Use bullet points for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Start each item with a capital letter
