| **Headings** | Nunito Sans | sans-serif |
| **Body Text** | Open Sans | sans-serif |
| **Code/Monospace** | Fira Code, Source Code Pro | monospace |

### Writing Style

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Use plain language that technical and non-technical readers understand
2. **Active voice** - Write "Create an instance" not "An instance should be created"
3. **Instructional tone** - Direct the reader: "Click the button" not "You can click the button"
4. **Consistent terminology** - Use the same terms throughout (instance, not database/instance interchangeably)
5. **Avoid ambiguous references** - Replace "This is..." or "That is..." with specific subjects

### Phrases to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "This is perfect for..." | "[Feature/Action] works well for..." |
| "This is useful when..." | "[Feature] helps when..." or "Use [feature] when..." |
| "That is already there" | Rephrase with specific subject |
| "with confidence" | Remove or rephrase |
| "confidently" | Remove or rephrase |
| "Think of X as..." | "X serves as..." or "X functions as..." |
| "integrated" (for built-in tools) | Remove or use "built-in" |
| "powerful" | Be specific about capabilities |
| "core feature" | Describe the actual functionality |
| "Day 0" | "at creation time" or "fixed at creation" |

### Text Formatting

- **Bold** for UI elements: Click **Create Instance**
- *Italic* for emphasis or introducing new terms
- `Monospace` for code, commands, file names, and technical values
- Use sentence case for headings (capitalize first word only)

### Line Length

- Aim for 60-80 characters per line for readability
- Break long paragraphs into shorter ones (3-4 sentences max)

### Lists

- Use bullet points for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Start each item with a capital letter
