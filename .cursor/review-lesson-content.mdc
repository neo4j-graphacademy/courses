# Lesson Review Checklist

You are an expert technical curriculum developer.

Review the following lesson for structure, pedagogy, and clarity. Use the Cursor Theory Lesson Checklist. Provide a pass/fail for each section with a short comment. Then suggest specific, actionable improvements.

The lesson content is in `lesson.adoc` in the folder. Any questions are in the `./questions/` subfolder with a suffix of `.adoc`. You must also review and fix any questions in the lesson.

Use this checklist to review any beginner-level theory lesson and ensure it meets the standards for pedagogy, clarity, and structure.

## ✅ Goal

Ensure the lesson:

- Is short and focused
- Introduces no more than three new concepts
- Uses consistent analogies and examples from the actual course content (NOT generic analogies)
- Builds on prior lessons if applicable
- Prepares the learner for a hands-on challenge next
- Aligns with the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy: _remember_ and _understand_

## 📋 Checklist

### 0. Grammar and Formatting

- [ ] Is the content written in US English? Do any spellings need to be corrected?
- [ ] Does the content contain any grammar mistakes, typos or other errors?
- [ ] All content should be written in **AsciiDoc** format with proper line breaks (two line breaks between sentences and lists)
- [ ] Is the title action oriented and in sentence case (eg. Fooing a bar)?
- [ ] Are level 2 headers action-oriented and in sentence case (e.g., "Installing the driver")?
- [ ] Do all admonitions have a title?
- [ ] Do any links to the Aura console point to `https://console.neo4j.io/graphacademy` (not `console.neo4j.io` without `/graphacademy`)?

An example of a good admonition:

```asciidoc
[WARNING]
.Overwriting existing data
=====
Restoring a snapshot overwrites all current data in your instance. Make sure you export a current snapshot first if you might need to recover the current state later.
=====
```

### 1. Length and Scope

- [ ] Is the content short enough to read in under 5 minutes?
- [ ] Does it introduce **no more than two** new concepts?

### 2. Tone and Clarity

- [ ] Is the tone casual, friendly, and succinct?
- [ ] Is the language clear and free of jargon?
- [ ] Is it free of filler, motivational fluff, or salesy language?
- [ ] Does the content use affirmative language "you will.." rather than "we will"?
- [ ] Are there any conversational but empty statements with no educational content?

### 3. Pedagogical Fit

- [ ] Does it focus on the **"remember"** and **"understand"** levels of Bloom's Taxonomy?
- [ ] Does it build logically on any **previous lessons**?
- [ ] Does the lesson have questions, and if so, are the answers for the questions covered in the main lesson content?

### 4. Opening Structure

The introduction must follow a specific two-part pattern:

**Part 1: Opening Statement (1-2 sentences)**
Choose the appropriate approach:

- **Option A - Direct continuation**: If building directly on knowledge from the previous lesson (e.g., you learned MATCH, now CREATE)
  - Reference what was learned in the previous lesson
  - Explain why the current topic follows naturally from it
  - Example: "You learned how to use MATCH to read data from the graph. To modify the graph, you need to learn how to create nodes and relationships."

- **Option B - New/related topic**: If NOT directly continuing from previous lesson
  - Make a statement about the primary topic you're teaching
  - Can establish importance or connect to broader course themes
  - Example: "Heap memory usage directly relates to how often the Java Virtual Machine must perform garbage collection. When heap usage is high, garbage collection runs more frequently, which can cause query pauses."

**Part 2: Learning Objective (1 sentence)**

- Must start with "In this lesson, you will learn..." (or "you'll learn")
- Clearly states what the learner will gain from the lesson

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Does the introduction follow the two-part pattern (opening statement + learning objective)?
- [ ] If directly building on previous lesson: Does it reference what was learned AND explain why the current topic follows?
- [ ] If NOT directly building on previous lesson: Does it make a statement about the primary topic being taught?
- [ ] Does the learning objective start with "In this lesson, you will learn..."?
- [ ] Does it avoid combining context and learning objective into one sentence?
- [ ] Does it avoid opening with generic analogies unrelated to the course content?
- [ ] Does it avoid explicit "Building on What You Know" headers?

**Good Examples:**

✅ **Option A - Direct continuation (building on previous lesson):**

```
You learned how to use MATCH to read data from the graph. To modify the graph, you need to learn how to create nodes and relationships.

In this lesson, you will learn how to use the CREATE clause to add data to your graph.
```

✅ **Option A - Direct continuation (monitoring series):**

```
In the previous lesson, you learned how to monitor CPU usage. CPU usage alone doesn't tell the full story—storage metrics reveal whether your database can handle your data volume.

In this lesson, you will learn how to monitor storage usage and identify when you're running out of space.
```

✅ **Option B - New/related topic (not direct continuation):**

```
Heap memory usage directly relates to how often the Java Virtual Machine must perform garbage collection. When heap usage is high, garbage collection runs more frequently, which can cause query pauses and performance degradation.

In this lesson, you will learn how to monitor garbage collection metrics and understand their impact on database performance.
```

❌ **Bad - Combines everything into one sentence:**

```
Now that you understand heap memory usage, you'll learn how to monitor garbage collection and its impact on performance.
```

❌ **Bad - Generic opening without context:**

```
In modern databases, garbage collection is important.

This lesson covers garbage collection monitoring.
```

### 5. Concept Delivery

For each concept:

- [ ] Is there a clear, plain-language definition?
- [ ] Are analogies consistent with the actual course content and examples being used?
- [ ] Are concrete examples drawn from the real-world context of the lesson (not generic movie recommendations unless that's the actual course topic)?
- [ ] Is there a short sentence someone might say aloud to explain it informally?
- [ ] (Optional) Is there a suggestion for a visual aid?
- [ ] **Core concepts should be transparent** - avoid explicit "Core Concept 1:" labels in headers
- [ ] Is there any assumed understanding here that needs to be addressed?

Consider the content in the previous lessons before judging the concepts. You can check `../../course.adoc` for prerequisite courses to see if the concept has already been explained.

### 6. Structure Compliance

Does the lesson follow this order?

- [ ] Introduction that follows the two-part pattern (see section 4 above)
- [ ] 1-2 concepts with action-oriented headers (each with definition, analogy from course context, example, spoken phrase, visual if needed)
- [ ] Practical context (where this fits in a system or pipeline)
- [ ] Simple teaser for the next lesson (what they'll do next, without salesy language)

### 7. Scaffolding and Progression

- [ ] Does the lesson clearly prepare the learner for a hands-on challenge?
- [ ] Does it evolve from prior knowledge logically?
- [ ] Does it avoid promotional and transformational language ("You'll see firsthand how this transforms...")?

### 8. Question Reviews

#### Single and multiple choice questions

If the lesson does not have questions inside the `questions/` folder, you can skip this step.

- [ ] Are the question titles in title case?
- [ ] Does the question have a brief title followed by one or more paragraphs asking a question?
- [ ] Do questions with multiple answers say "Select all that apply:" or similar?
- [ ] Does the question have a hint that guides the user towards the answer without explicitly giving it?
- [ ] Is the hint friendly and empathetic, or could it be considered antagonistic?
- [ ] Does the question have a solution that gives the user the answer and explains why it is correct?
- [ ] Does the solution highlight only the correct answer(s) in bold?
- [ ] The lesson should not be sequential (`:sequential: true`) if there is only one question.

#### Verify questions

If the question is a hands-on challenge and includes the :type: challenge

## Task

Your task is to review the document and provide suggestions. Fix anything that can be fixed directly in the file. If the problem cannot be fixed, provide a check list that can be ticked off one-by-one at the top of the file.

Also review and fix any questions.
