# Lesson Review Checklist

You are an expert technical curriculum developer.

Review the following lesson for structure, pedagogy, and clarity. Use the Cursor Theory Lesson Checklist. Provide a pass/fail for each section with a short comment. Then suggest specific, actionable improvements.

The lesson content is in `lesson.adoc` in the folder.  Any questions are in the `./questions/` subfolder with a suffix of `.adoc`.  You must also review and fix any questions in the lesson.

Use this checklist to review any beginner-level theory lesson and ensure it meets the standards for pedagogy, clarity, and structure.

## âœ… Goal

Ensure the lesson:
- Is short and focused
- Introduces no more than three new concepts
- Uses consistent analogies and examples from the actual course content (NOT generic analogies)
- Builds on prior lessons if applicable
- Prepares the learner for a hands-on challenge next
- Aligns with the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy: *remember* and *understand*

## ðŸ“‹ Checklist

### 0. Grammar and Formatting

- [ ] Is the content written in US English?  Do any spellings need to be corrected?
- [ ] Does the content contain any grammar mistakes, typos or other errors?
- [ ] All content should be written in **AsciiDoc** format with proper line breaks (two line breaks between sentences and lists)
- [ ] Is the title action oriented and in sentence case (eg. Fooing a bar)?
- [ ] Are level 2 headers action-oriented and in sentence case (e.g., "Installing the driver")?
- [ ] Do all admonitions have a title?

An example of a good admonition: 

```asciidoc
[WARNING]
.Overwriting existing data
=====
Restoring a snapshot overwrites all current data in your instance. Make sure you export a current snapshot first if you might need to recover the current state later.
=====
```

### 1. Length and Scope

- [ ] Is the content short enough to read in under 5 minutes?
- [ ] Does it introduce **no more than two** new concepts?

### 2. Tone and Clarity

- [ ] Is the tone casual, friendly, and succinct?
- [ ] Is the language clear and free of jargon?
- [ ] Is it free of filler, motivational fluff, or salesy language?
- [ ] Does the content use affirmative language "you will.." rather than "we will"?

### 3. Pedagogical Fit

- [ ] Does it focus on the **"remember"** and **"understand"** levels of Bloom's Taxonomy?
- [ ] Does it build logically on any **previous lessons**?
- [ ] Does the lesson have questions, and if so, are the answers for the questions covered in the main lesson content?

### 4. Opening Structure

- [ ] Does the opening structure explain how this lesson builds upon the concepts learned in the previous lesson?
- [ ] Does it explain succinctly what the user will learn in this lesson?
- [ ] Does it avoid opening with generic analogies unrelated to the course content?
- [ ] Does prior knowledge reference flow naturally in the introduction without explicit "Building on What You Know" headers?

### 5. Concept Delivery

For each concept:

- [ ] Is there a clear, plain-language definition?
- [ ] Are analogies consistent with the actual course content and examples being used?
- [ ] Are concrete examples drawn from the real-world context of the lesson (not generic movie recommendations unless that's the actual course topic)?
- [ ] Is there a short sentence someone might say aloud to explain it informally?
- [ ] (Optional) Is there a suggestion for a visual aid?
- [ ] **Core concepts should be transparent** - avoid explicit "Core Concept 1:" labels in headers

Consider the content in the previous lessons before judging the concepts. You can check `../../course.adoc` for prerequisite courses to see if the concept has already been explained.

### 6. Structure Compliance

Does the lesson follow this order?

- [ ] Intro that references previous lessons and states learning objectives
- [ ] 1-2 concepts with action-oriented headers (each with definition, analogy from course context, example, spoken phrase, visual if needed)
- [ ] Practical context (where this fits in a system or pipeline)
- [ ] Simple teaser for the next lesson (what they'll do next, without salesy language)

### 7. Scaffolding and Progression

- [ ] Does the lesson clearly prepare the learner for a hands-on challenge?
- [ ] Does it evolve from prior knowledge logically?
- [ ] Does it avoid promotional and transformational language ("You'll see firsthand how this transforms...")?


### 8. Question Reviews


#### Single and multiple choice questions 

If the lesson does not have questions inside the `questions/` folder, you can skip this step.

- [ ] Are the question titles in title case?
- [ ] Does the question have a brief title followed by one or more paragraphs asking a question?
- [ ] Do questions with multiple answers say "Select all that apply:" or similar?
- [ ] Does the question have a hint that guides the user towards the answer without explicitly giving it?
- [ ] Is the hint friendly and empathetic, or could it be considered antagonistic?
- [ ] Does the question have a solution that gives the user the answer and explains why it is correct?
- [ ] Does the solution highlight only the correct answer(s) in bold?


#### Verify questions

If the question is a hands-on challenge and includes the :type: challenge

- [ ]



## Task

Your task is to review the document and provide suggestions. Fix anything that can be fixed directly in the file. If the problem cannot be fixed, provide a check list that can be ticked off one-by-one at the top of the file.

Also review and fix any questions.
