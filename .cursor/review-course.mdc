Your task is to create a final structural review of a course before it goes onto the website in draft mode for feedback.

Iterate through the module, lesson and question folders to perform Quality Assurance tests.


## Lesson Checklist

- [ ] Does the `lesson.adoc` file have a `:type:` attribute?  If not, does it have a video? Is it a quiz?  Is it a challenge?  Valid options are `video` (when a `video::` block is listed only), `quiz` (where text and questions are present) and `challenge` (where the user is required to do something).
- [ ] Does the `lesson.adoc` file have an `:order:` attribute that reflects the name of the folder?  Eg. `3c-using-foo` should have `:order: 3` and `4-deleting-nodes` should have `:order: 4`.
- [ ] Does the lesson include all of the files in the questions folder?

## Module Checklist

- [ ] Does the `module.adoc` file for each module contain an accurate overview of the module?  If not, update it.
- [ ] Does the `module.adoc` file have an `:order:` attribute that reflects the name of the folder?

## Course Checklist 

- [ ] Does the course outline in `course.adoc` reflect the high-level overview from each module?  If not, update it.
- [ ] Is there an `illustration.svg` file in the course folder?
- [ ] Is there a `banner.png` file in the course folder?
- [ ] Does `course.adoc` have a `:caption:` attribute?  If not, generate a short, succint overview of the course.
- [ ] Does `course.adoc` have a `:key-points:` attribute?  If not, generate 3 to 5 key points that are covered in the course based on what is covered in each module.
- [ ] Does the course have a `=== What you will learn` section?  Does the list reflect what is covered in the course?
- [ ] Does the course have a `== This course includes` section with the key things that the user will learn?
