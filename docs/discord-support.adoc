== Most common questions

* Cannot execute code against the sandbox.
** Does the course have a connection to the sandbox?
*** They should log in to sandbox.neo4j.com in a different tab and sign in with the same credentials they use to sign in to GraphAcademy.
**** Do they see the $neo4j prompt in the sandbox window for the course? Sometimes it takes a minute or so for the $neo4j prompt to appear.

* If the Challenge does not validate:
** Did they possibly modify the graph in sandbox.neo4j.com, but possibly the wrong database?
** Are they using the same sandbox instance for 2 courses? This happens when the user is currently going through 2 courses at the same time.
