= Transferring enrollments between accounts

To transfer an enrolment from an old user to a new one, you must manually run a Cypher statement.

1. Ask the user to log in with their _new_ account and let you know the authentication method (Google account, email & password etc.)
2. Run the following Cypher statement

:params { old: "adam@neo4j.com", new: "graphacademy@neo4j.com"}

MATCH (new:User {email: $new})
MATCH (old:User {email: $old})-[r:HAS_ENROLMENT]->(e)
DELETE r
MERGE (new)-[:HAS_ENROLMENT]->(e)
// if new user does not have an id  add one
MATCH (new: User {email: $new})
WHERE new.id IS NULL
SET new.id = coalesce(new.id, randomUuid())
