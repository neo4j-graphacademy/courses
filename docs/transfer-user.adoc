= Transferring enrollments between accounts

To transfer an enrolment from an old user to a new one, you must manually run a Cypher statement.

1. Ask the user to log in with their _new_ account and let you know the authentication method (Google account, email & password etc.)
2. Run the following Cypher statement:


[source,cypher]
----
:params { old: "adam@neo4j.com", new: "graphacademy@neo4j.com"}

MATCH (new:User {email: $new})
MATCH (old:User {email: $old})-[r:HAS_ENROLMENT]->(e)
DELETE r
MERGE (new)-[:HAS_ENROLMENT]->(e)
SET new.id = coalesce(new.id, randomUuid())
----

Or, if you have the ID of the accounts from the user's public profile, you can use those instead:

[source,cypher]
----
:params { old: "xxxxxxxx-000x-xx00-x000-x0000x00000", new: "xxxxxxxx-000x-xx00-x000-x0000x00001"}

MATCH (new:User {id: $new})
MATCH (old:User {id: $old})-[r:HAS_ENROLMENT]->(e)
DELETE r
MERGE (new)-[:HAS_ENROLMENT]->(e)
----


Or, in the `website` repository, you can run the following command to transfer from the user node with the `id` property of the fourth argument to the one with the `id` property of the fifth.
The third parameter can be `id` or `email`.

```
npm run cmd:transfer-enrolments id xxxxxxxx-000x-xx00-x000-x0000x00000 xxxxxxxx-000x-xx00-x000-x0000x00001
```
