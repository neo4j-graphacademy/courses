= T-shirts

NOTE:

Effective March 15, 2023, all t-shirt orders for folks in India are placed in this spreadsheet and NOT added to printful.
We have a vendor who will have access to this spreadsheet to ship to India.

== Here are some common problems:

* Could not order t-shirt
** Make sure they passed the certification:
[source,cypher]
----
match (u:User)-[:HAS_ENROLMENT]-(x:CompletedEnrolment)--(c:Certification)
where u.email = 'USER-email'
return u,x
----

** Check printful (https://www.printful.com/dashboard/default/orders) to see if the order is in the system.
** Make sure they have not already received a t-shirt according to the "old" Community DB
