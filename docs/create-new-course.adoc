= Creating a new course

This is the primary repo for a new course:

* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses

[NOTE]
All courses should have their own branches that are off of main.
You should work on one course at a time so that all commits for the PR will be related to the same course.

If your course will also need supporting files, you will need to create an additional supporting repo for  your course.
Here are the current supporting repos for our courses:

* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/importing-data
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-nodejs
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-python
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-typescript
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-go
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-java
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-dotnet

[NOTE]

== Creating course content

. If you have not done so yet, clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses
. Add a local branch in git:
.. git checkout main
.. git pull origin main
.. git branch -a to see local branches
.. git checkout -b <local branch name for the new course>
.. git pull origin main
. In your asciidoc development environment of choice:
.. Add a directory under courses
.. Use the same course structure as other courses

[NOTE]
Use a later course such as cypher-aggregations as a model or one of the app-dev courses.

[start=4]
. In the *course.adoc* file, make sure the following attribute is set so the course will be deployed, but not yet published for non-Neo4j users.
*:status: draft*
. Commit your changes to the branch in the repo:
.. git status   (to see files modified/deleted/added)
.. git add *
.. git status (to see files to be committed)
.. git commit  -m "description of the changes"
.. git push origin <local branch name>
. Create a Pull Request for the branch
.. Go to https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses and go to the branch you just committed
.. Add a Pull Request
.. Add a title and if need be description of the PR
.. Add reviewers for the PR if you want it reviewed
. Merge the PR into main
.. If you have the PR review needed and are ready to merge, merge the PR

== Test the course

. Deploy the course changes (see *deploy-merged-prs*)
. Go through the course to QA it and make changes as necessary, then repeat the commit/PR/deploy
. Ask for review of the course in the #graphacademy channel
.. Neo4j users can scroll down and instead of expressing interest in the course, can enroll if they have a neo4j email in GraphAcademy
.. Ask users to provide feedback that contains the course page link with their feedback in a doc
. Make changes and commit/PR/deploy again per user feedback
. Review the course again in GraphAcademy
. Make videos for the course (*create-videos.adoc*)
. Make changes and commit/PR/deploy again
. Review the course again in GraphAcademy

== Publish the course

. Add a banner.png  and badge,svg for the course (discuss with Adam)
. Set the course live:  :status: active
. Make changes and commit/PR/deploy again
. Write a developer blog post about the new course and publish (see developer-blog.adoc)
