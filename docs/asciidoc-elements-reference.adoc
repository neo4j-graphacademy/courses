== Best Practices

=== Content Organization Guidelines

==== Avoid Numbered References
**❌ Don't use:**
- "In Lesson 2, we learned..."
- "From Module 1, you'll remember..."
- "As we saw in Lesson 3..."

**✅ Use instead:**
- "In the previous lesson, we learned..."
- "Earlier, you learned..."
- "As we saw when building the knowledge graph..."
- "When we explored retrievers..."

**Why:** Numbered references create maintenance problems when content gets reorganized, lessons are reordered, or modules are restructured.

=== Slide Design
1. **Keep slides concise** - Use bullet points and short phrases
2. **Use transcript-only for details** - Put lengthy explanations in transcript blocks
3. **Balance columns** - Ensure column content is roughly equal in length
4. **Include alt text** - Always provide descriptive alt text for images

=== Content Organization
1. **Start with discrete slide** - Use `[.slide.discrete]` for introduction
2. **End with summary** - Always include a `[.summary]` section
3. **Add continue button** - Include `read::Continue[]` for navigation
4. **Use consistent titles** - Follow the same heading structure throughout

=== Accessibility
1. **Alt text for images** - Describe what the image shows
2. **Logical heading hierarchy** - Use proper heading levels (==, ===, etc.)
3. **Meaningful link text** - Avoid "click here" type links
