= Updating an existing course

The repos used for GraphAcademy courses include:

Course content:

* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses

Files that support a course:

* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/importing-data
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-nodejs
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-python
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-typescript
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-go
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-java
* https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-dotnet

[NOTE]
All updates to the *course* repo should have their own branches that are off of *main*.
The exception to this are the files for a course where all work is done off of main (no branches)
Ideally, you should update one course at a time so that all updates for the PR will be related to the same course.

== Updating course content

If a course lesson/challenge/questions change, then you must use these steps to update a course.

[NOTE]
You need not change course files if your changes *only* apply to the files for supporting a course (the app-** and importing-data repos)

.  If you have not done so already, clone the git repo for a course: https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses
//? how to make the git command copyable
.. [copy]git checkout main
.. git pull origin main
.. If there is already a local branch:
... git branch -a to see local branches
... git checkout <local branch name>
.. If there is no local branch:
... git branch -a to see local branches
... git checkout -b <local branch name>
... git pull origin main
.. Edit the course in your asciidoc editor of choice
.. Commit your changes to the branch in the repo:
... git status   (to see files modified/deleted/added)
... git add *
... git status (to see files to be committed
... git commit  -m "description of the changes"
... git push origin <local branch name>
.. If ready to, create a Pull Request for the branch
... Go to https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses and go to the branch you just committed
... Add a Pull Request
... Add a title and if need be, a description of the PR
... Add reviewers for the PR if you want it reviewed
.. If you have the review needed and are ready to merge, merge the PR

**Next:**

. Update course supporting files (if applicable)
. Deploy the course  and/or supporting file changes (see *deploy-merged-prs.adoc*)

== Updating course's supporting files

[NOTE]
Make sure that any changes to a course's support files do not warrant a change to a lesson/challenge/question. If so you must also update the coursew files.


.  If you have not done so already, clone the git repo for a course supporting files.
.. [copy]git checkout main
.. git pull origin main
.. Edit the course in your asciidoc editor of choice
.. Commit your changes to the repo:
... git status   (to see files modified/deleted/added)
... git add *
... git status (to see files to be committed
... git commit  -m "description of the changes"
... git push
.. If ready to, create a Pull Request for the branch
... Go to https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses and go to the branch you just committed
... Add a Pull Request
... Add a title and if need be, a description of the PR
... Add reviewers for the PR if you want it reviewed
.. If you have the review needed and are ready to merge, merge the PR

**Next:**

. Update course (if applicable)
. Deploy the course  and/or supporting file changes (see *deploy-merged-prs.adoc*)
