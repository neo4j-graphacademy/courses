= Deploy to GraphAcademy

[NOTE]
Make sure that any PR for a course has been merged before you deploy.

. If you have not done so already, clone the git repo(s) that have merged PRs that you want to deploy.  For changes to a course, you may need to deploy multiple repos. The repos that we currently have include:
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/importing-data
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-nodejs
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-python
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-typescript
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-go
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-java
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-dotnet
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/neo4j-browser
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/neoflix
.. https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/neoflix-cypher
. For each repo that you want to deploy:
.. git checkout main
.. git pull origin main
.. npm version patch
.. git push --tags origin main
.. Make a note of the tag number
.. Go to the repo you want to deploy.
.. Click Actions
.. Click on the number to see it progressing (make sure the restarting-cluster step completes successfully; it is OK if the invalidate cache step fails)
.. Go to the course live in graphacademy.neo4j.com to confirm the course or changed course.
