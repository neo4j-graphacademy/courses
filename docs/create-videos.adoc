= Creating videos for a course

[NOTE]
At this writing, there is no standard tools used for creating videos.
Elaine has used Camtasia for creating videos, but a course developer is free to use whatever tool they are comfortable using.

A course has an introductory video and every lesson that is not a Challenge has a video.

At this writing, this folder contains all assets for the videos created thus far:

The components you must create for a video are:

. **Keynote** file to:
.. Introduce course/lesson
.. Create the .png that will be uploaded to Youtube for the video image
.. Show content that is not a demo
.. Outro
. **.mp4** file that is uploaded to Youtube

The audio for a lesson video should match the content for the lesson.
[NOTE]
Elaine typically recorded the audio and then captured the video to possibly sync to the audio, but this is not always easy to do!
