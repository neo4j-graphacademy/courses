[NOTE]
.LangSmith API Warning
====
The agent uses a prompt hosted on the LangChain hub.

The agent will still run successfully but you will receive a `LangSmithMissingAPIKeyWarning` warning if you don't have a LangSmith API key.

You can link:https://docs.smith.langchain.com/administration/how_to_guides/organization_management/create_account_api_key[Create a LangSmith Personal Access Token API Key] and assign it to the `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` environment variable to remove the warning.
