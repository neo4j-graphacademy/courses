.Allow Dangerous Requests
====
You are trusting the generation of Cypher to the LLM.
It may generate invalid Cypher queries that could corrupt data in the graph or provide access to sensitive information.

You have to opt-in to this risk by setting the `allow_dangerous_requests` flag to `True`.

In a production environment, you should ensure that access to data is limited, and sufficient security is in place to prevent malicious queries.
