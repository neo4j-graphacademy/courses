[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Start with critical alerts only** is correct.

Beginning with critical alerts helps avoid alert fatigue by focusing on conditions that require immediate attention. You can add additional alerts over time as you understand your system's normal operating patterns.

**Create alerts for every metric** - Leads to alert fatigue and noise. **Set very low thresholds** - Causes too many false positives. **Configure alerts after problems occur** - Reactive rather than proactive monitoring.
