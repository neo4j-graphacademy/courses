.Solution
====
**OAuth2 with client ID and secret** is correct.

The Aura metrics endpoint requires OAuth2 authentication using a client ID and client secret generated in your Aura settings. The token URL is `https://api.neo4j.io/oauth/token`.

**Basic authentication** - Aura does not support basic authentication for the metrics endpoint. **API key authentication** - The endpoint uses OAuth2, not API keys. **No authentication** - Authentication is required to access metrics.
