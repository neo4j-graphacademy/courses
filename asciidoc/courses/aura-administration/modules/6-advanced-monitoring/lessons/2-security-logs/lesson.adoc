== Introduction

Security logs track authentication, authorization, and other security-related events in your Aura database.

In this lesson, you will learn how to access and use security logs for auditing and compliance purposes.


== Accessing Security Logs

To access security logs:

. Navigate to your Aura instance
. Click **Operations**
. Select **Logs**
. Choose the **Security** tab

Security logs provide a complete audit trail of security events.


== Security Log Interface

The security log interface provides:


=== Filter Options

* **Status**: Info, Warning, Error
* **Executing user**: Database user who performed the action
* **Authenticated user**: User who authenticated the session
* **Driver**: Client driver used
* **Message text**: Search within log messages


=== Two Main Tabs

**Summary tab**: Aggregated view of security events

**Details tab**: Individual security event records


== The Summary Tab


=== What It Shows

For each unique security event pattern:

* **Status**: Info, Warning, or Error
* **Message**: Event description
* **Executing user**: User who performed the action
* **Count**: Number of occurrences
* **From**: First occurrence time
* **To**: Last occurrence time
* **Authenticated users**: List of users involved


=== Common Events

**Successful authentication**:

* Message: "Successful authentication"
* Status: Info
* Indicates normal login activity


**Failed authentication**:

* Message: "Authentication failed"
* Status: Warning or Error
* May indicate attacks or configuration issues


**Authorization failures**:

* Message: "Permission denied"
* Status: Warning
* User attempted unauthorized operation


**Connection events**:

* Message: "Logged in" / "Logged out"
* Status: Info
* Tracks session lifecycle


## The Details Tab


=== What It Shows

For each security event:

* **Status**: Info, Warning, Error
* **Message**: Specific event description
* **Executing user**: User who performed the action
* **Time**: When the event occurred
* **Authenticated user**: Original authenticated user
* **Database**: Target database
* **Driver**: Client driver information


== Common Security Monitoring Use Cases


=== Audit Compliance

Track all database access for compliance requirements:

**Filter settings**:

* Time period: Audit period (e.g., last 30 days)
* No other filters (capture all events)

**Export** the logs for compliance reporting.


=== Failed Login Monitoring

Identify potential security threats:

**Filter settings**:

* Status: Error or Warning
* Message text: "authentication failed"

**Look for**:

* Repeated failures from same source
* Failures for non-existent users
* Brute force attack patterns


=== Permission Issues

Debug authorization problems:

**Filter settings**:

* Status: Warning
* Message text: "permission" or "denied"

**Identify**:

* Users lacking necessary permissions
* Role configuration issues
* Application misconfiguration


=== Suspicious Activity

Identify unusual patterns:

**Look for**:

* Logins at unusual times
* Access from unexpected locations
* Unusual user activity patterns
* Privilege escalation attempts


== Security Event Types


=== Authentication Events

**Successful login**:

----
Status: Info
Message: Successful authentication
User: app_user
----

Normal operation - user successfully authenticated.


**Failed login**:

----
Status: Warning
Message: Authentication failed: Invalid credentials
User: attempted_user
----

May indicate:

* User typo
* Expired credentials
* Attack attempt


=== Authorization Events

**Permission denied**:

----
Status: Warning
Message: Permission denied: Insufficient privileges
User: app_user
----

User attempted operation they're not authorized for.


**Role change**:

----
Status: Info
Message: Role granted to user
User: admin
----

Administrative action modifying permissions.


=== Session Events

**Session started**:

----
Status: Info
Message: Logged in
User: app_user
----

User session began.


**Session ended**:

----
Status: Info
Message: Logged out
User: app_user
----

User session terminated (normally or abnormally).


== Security Best Practices

Review security logs weekly, monitoring for failed authentication patterns, permission denied events, and anomalies. Alert on multiple failed attempts, permission violations, and unusual activity.

For user management, review accounts regularly, remove departed personnel, use least-privilege access, and rotate credentials periodically. Retain logs per compliance requirements and maintain an audit trail.


== Investigating Security Incidents

**Multiple Failed Logins**: Filter by Status: Warning, the username, and recent time period. Check if the driver is from a known application, look for automated attack patterns, verify the account is legitimate, and check if a successful login followed. Block malicious IPs or reset compromised passwords.

**Permission Denied Errors**: Filter for Status: Warning and "permission" in messages. Identify affected users and operations, check for recent permission changes, then grant access or fix role assignments as needed.

**Correlating with Other Data**: Match security events with query logs (failed auth followed by queries, permission denials with specific queries), resource metrics (login events during CPU spikes), and application logs (errors matching database permission denials).

== Summary

You learned how to access and use security logs for your Aura instances.

Security logs provide an audit trail of authentication, authorization, and session events.

Regular review of security logs helps identify security threats, debug permission issues, and maintain compliance with audit requirements.

Filter security logs by status, user, and message text to find specific events and patterns.

Congratulations! You've completed the Aura In Production course and are now equipped to effectively monitor and manage Neo4j Aura databases in production environments.
