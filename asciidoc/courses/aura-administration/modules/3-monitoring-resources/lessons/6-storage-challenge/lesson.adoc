=  Addressing a storage emergency
:type: challenge
:order: 6

In the previous lesson, you learned when to scale your instance and how to monitor storage growth patterns.

Now, you'll apply that knowledge to a real-world scenario.

You sign into your Aura Console and access the metrics dashboard for your instance at 11:45 on Monday morning.

You notice that the storage usage percentage has jumped from 80% to 95% in the past 3 hours.

Looking through the query logs, you can see thousands of write queries that are creating new data in the database.

== Summary

You've now applied your knowledge of storage monitoring to a real-world emergency scenario.

When storage reaches critical levels with rapid growth, you should scale the instance to maintain operational stability.

In the next module, you'll learn how to monitor instance-level performance metrics including memory usage, page cache, and garbage collection.
