= Mitigating Out of Memory Errors in Write Queries

What should you do to mitigate Out of Memory errors in write operations that occur at scheduled times?

* [ ] Use `EXPLAIN` or `PROFILE` to review the query plan
* [x] Break large write operations into smaller batches using `CALL { } IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS`
* [ ] Scale the instance to provide more heap memory
* [ ] Add `LIMIT` clauses to restrict the number of writes

Process data incrementally instead of loading everything into memory.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Break large write operations into smaller batches using `CALL { } IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS`** is correct.

Use `CALL { } IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS` to process data incrementally. This prevents transactions from accumulating too many changes in memory before commit.

**`EXPLAIN` or `PROFILE`** - for read queries only. **Scaling** - scheduled errors have fixable query-level causes. **`LIMIT` clauses** - for read queries, not write operations.
