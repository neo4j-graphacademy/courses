= High CPU Usage Response

You notice your Aura instance CPU usage has been consistently at 90-95% for the past 3 hours during normal business operations.

What should you do first?

* [ ] Wait and monitor for another day to confirm it's not temporary

* [ ] Restart the instance to clear any issues

* [x] Review query logs to identify resource-intensive queries, then consider scaling

* [ ] Immediately scale up the instance without investigation

.Hint
====
When CPU is consistently high, you need to understand the cause before taking action. Consider what information would help you make an informed decision.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Review query logs to identify resource-intensive queries, then consider scaling** is correct.

This is the best approach because 90-95% sustained usage indicates the instance is under-provisioned or queries are inefficient, query logs will show if specific queries are consuming excessive CPU, you may be able to optimize queries instead of scaling, and understanding the root cause ensures the right fix.

Why the alternatives are less effective: Waiting another day prolongs poor performance for users, restarting doesn't address the underlying cause, and scaling without investigation might be unnecessary if queries can be optimized.

After reviewing query logs, you may find you can optimize problematic queries, or you may confirm that scaling is needed for the workload.
