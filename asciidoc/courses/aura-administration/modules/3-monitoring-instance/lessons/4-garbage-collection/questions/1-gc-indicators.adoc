= Garbage Collection Analysis

Your monitoring shows:

. Total GC time: 12% of runtime
. Old Gen GC: Occurring every 5 minutes, taking 3-5 seconds each
. Heap usage: 88-92%

What's causing the user-facing freezes?

* [ ] Young generation GC is too frequent

* [x] High heap usage causing excessive Old Gen GC

* [ ] Normal GC behavior for Neo4j

* [ ] Database needs restart to clear GC issues

Review the GC thresholds in this lesson. What percentage of time in GC indicates a problem, and what's causing the Old Gen GC frequency?

.Solution
====
**High heap usage causing excessive Old Gen GC** is correct.

GC analysis: **Total GC: 12%** is critical (should be <2%, warning at 5-10%), **Old Gen GC: Every 5 minutes** is too frequent (should be hours apart), **Old Gen duration: 3-5 seconds** causes user-facing pauses, and **Heap: 88-92%** is too high (should be below 80%). The root cause is high heap memory usage forcing frequent, expensive Old Gen garbage collections.

**Impact on users**: Application "freezes" for 3-5 seconds every 5 minutes, creating poor user experience and potential query timeouts.

**Solution**: Scale instance to get more heap memory, which will reduce heap usage percentage, decrease Old Gen GC frequency, and eliminate user-facing pauses.

Why the other answers are wrong: Young Gen isn't mentioned as problematic, 12% GC time is NOT normal (it's at critical level), and restarting won't fix the underlying memory capacity issue.

When Old Gen GC is frequent and heap usage is high, the instance needs more memory.
