= Heap Memory Threshold

Your monitoring shows heap memory usage has been between 82-88% for the past week.

According to best practices, what action should you take?

* [ ] This is normal - no action needed

* [ ] Restart the instance to clear memory

* [x] Investigate and plan to scale - heap should stay below 80%
* [ ] Wait until it reaches 95% before taking action

.Solution

**Investigate and plan to scale - heap should stay below 80%** is correct.

Heap usage best practices: **Normal** is 30-70% with occasional spikes to 80%, **Warning** is sustained 80-85%, and **Problem** is >85% sustained.

At 82-88% sustained for a week, you're in the warning/problem zone. This leads to increased garbage collection frequency, performance degradation, and risk of out-of-memory errors.

Recommended actions:
1. Review query logs for memory-intensive queries
2. Check if specific queries can be optimized
3. Plan instance scaling if workload is legitimate

Why the other answers are wrong: 82-88% is NOT normal (it's too high), restarting doesn't fix the underlying memory needs, and waiting until 95% risks crashes and severe performance issues.

Heap usage should not exceed 80% for long periods. Short spikes are normal, but sustained high usage requires action.
