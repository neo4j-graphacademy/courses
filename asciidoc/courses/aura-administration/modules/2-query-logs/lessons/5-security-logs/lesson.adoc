== Introduction

Security logs provide a complete audit trail of authentication, authorization, and session events in your Aura database. They help you identify security threats, debug permission issues, and maintain compliance with audit requirements.

In this lesson, you will learn how to access and use security logs to monitor database access and investigate security incidents.


== Accessing Security Logs

To access security logs, navigate to your Aura instance, click **Operations**, select **Logs**, and choose the **Security** tab.

Security logs are available for 30 days, and each request can retrieve up to 24 hours of data.


== Security Log Interface

The security log interface provides filters to narrow your search and two views to analyze security events.


=== Filter Options

You can filter security logs by:

* **Status**: Info, Warning, Error
* **Executing user**: Database user who performed the action
* **Authenticated user**: User whose credentials were used to authenticate the session
* **Driver**: Client driver used to connect
* **Message text**: Search within log messages (case-insensitive)


=== Summary and Details Views

The **Summary tab** shows aggregated security events grouped by status and executing user. This view displays the count, time range, and users involved for each event pattern.

The **Details tab** shows individual security event records with specific timestamps, users, databases, and driver information.


== Understanding Security Events

Security logs track three main categories of events.


=== Authentication Events

**Successful authentication** events have an Info status and the message "Successful authentication". These indicate normal login activity.

**Failed authentication** events have a Warning or Error status and the message "Authentication failed". These may indicate credential issues, expired passwords, or attack attempts.


=== Authorization Events

**Permission denied** events have a Warning status and indicate a user attempted an operation they're not authorized to perform. These help identify role configuration issues or application misconfiguration.

**Role change** events have an Info status and track administrative actions that modify user permissions.


=== Session Events

**Logged in** and **Logged out** events have an Info status and track the session lifecycle. These help you understand user activity patterns and session duration.


== Common Security Monitoring Scenarios


=== Monitoring Failed Logins

To identify potential security threats, filter by Status: Error or Warning and Message text: "authentication failed".

Look for repeated failures from the same user, failures for non-existent users, or patterns suggesting brute force attacks. Check the Driver field to see if attempts come from known applications.


=== Debugging Permission Issues

To troubleshoot authorization problems, filter by Status: Warning and Message text: "permission" or "denied".

Identify which users lack necessary permissions and which operations they attempted. Check if recent permission changes caused the issues.


=== Audit Compliance

To track all database access for compliance requirements, set the time period to your audit period (e.g., last 30 days) without additional filters.

Export the logs using the download option for compliance reporting.


=== Investigating Suspicious Activity

Review security logs for logins at unusual times, access from unexpected drivers, privilege escalation attempts, or unusual user activity patterns.

Correlate security events with query logs to identify failed authentication followed by queries or permission denials with specific query patterns.


== Security Log Best Practices

Review security logs weekly to establish baseline patterns. Monitor for repeated failed authentication attempts, which may indicate attacks or configuration issues.

Alert on permission violation patterns that suggest applications are misconfigured or users need role adjustments.

Retain logs according to your compliance requirements and maintain an audit trail for regulatory purposes.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to use security logs to monitor database access and investigate security incidents.

Security logs track authentication, authorization, and session events with filters for status, executing user, authenticated user, driver, and message text. The Summary view shows aggregated patterns while the Details view shows individual events.

Common use cases include monitoring failed logins for security threats, debugging permission issues, maintaining audit compliance, and investigating suspicious activity patterns.

In the next module, you will learn about monitoring instance-level resources including heap memory, storage, and connections.
