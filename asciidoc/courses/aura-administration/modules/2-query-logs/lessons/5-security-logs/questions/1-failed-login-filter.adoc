= Filtering for Suspicious Driver Activity

Your production Java application uses the `app_service` database user and always connects with the `neo4j-java/5.x` driver.


While reviewing security logs, you notice several **successful login** entries for the `app_service` user from a `neo4j-python/5.x` driver—which your application never uses.


You want to filter the security logs to show **only these suspicious Python driver connections** for further investigation.


Which combination of filters would display exactly this suspicious activity?


* [x] Executing user: "app_service"
* [x] Driver: "neo4j-python"
* [ ] Status: Error
* [ ] Database: "neo4j"

You're looking for successful logins from a specific user using an unexpected driver. What filters would show exactly that?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Executing user: "app_service"** and **Driver: "neo4j-python"** are both correct.


This combination isolates exactly the suspicious activity: the `app_service` account connecting from an unexpected Python driver. These two filters are sufficient to show all instances of this specific security concern.


**Status: Error** - This wouldn't help because the scenario mentions **successful** logins. Successful authentications have Info status, so filtering for Error would exclude the suspicious activity you're trying to find.


**Database: "neo4j"** - Database is not available as a filter option in the security logs interface. The available filters are Status, Executing User, Authenticated User, Driver, and Message text.


The key insight: Use the minimum filters needed to isolate the anomaly—in this case, the specific user account and the unexpected driver that's connecting.
