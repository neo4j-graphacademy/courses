= Detecting Suspicious Driver Activity

Your production Java application uses the `app_service` database user and connects with the `neo4j-java/5.x` driver. Security logs suddenly show activity for the `app_service` user from a `neo4j-python/5.x` driver.

Which filters would help you investigate this potential security threat?

Select all that apply.

* [x] Executing user: "app_service"
* [x] Driver: "neo4j-python"
* [ ] Status: Error or Warning
* [ ] Message text: "authentication failed"
* [ ] Authenticated user: "neo4j"

.Solution
====
**Executing user: "app_service"** and **Driver: "neo4j-python"** are both correct.

This combination helps you identify all activity from the compromised `app_service` account using the unexpected Python driver. A Java application suddenly showing Python driver activity is a red flag for credential compromise or unauthorized access. The Executing user field shows who performed the action, while the Driver field reveals what client connected.

**Status: Error or Warning** - This would only show failed operations, not successful unauthorized access. **Message text: "authentication failed"** - The authentication succeeded (which is the concern), so this won't help. **Authenticated user: "neo4j"** - This filters for a different user account, not the compromised service account.
