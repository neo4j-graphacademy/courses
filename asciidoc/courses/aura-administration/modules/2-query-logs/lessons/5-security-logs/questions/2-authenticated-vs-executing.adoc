* [ ] Authenticated User shows who ran the query, Executing User shows who owns the database
* [ ] They always show the same user and are redundant fields
* [x] Authenticated User shows whose credentials were used, Executing User shows who performed the action
* [ ] Authenticated User is for console access, Executing User is for database access

**Authenticated User shows whose credentials were used, Executing User shows who performed the action** is correct.

These fields differ when impersonation is used. The Authenticated User is the user whose credentials authenticated the session, while the Executing User is the user who actually performed the action. This distinction is important for audit trails and security investigations.

**Who ran the query vs database owner** - Both fields relate to users performing actions, not database ownership. **Always the same** - These fields differ when impersonation is used, making them distinct. **Console vs database** - Both fields apply to database access, not console access.
