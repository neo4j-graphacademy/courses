.Solution
====
**Authenticated User shows whose credentials were used, Executing User shows who performed the action** is correct.


These fields differ when impersonation is used. Authenticated User is who logged in, while Executing User is who actually performed the action. This distinction is critical for audit trails when investigating security incidents.
