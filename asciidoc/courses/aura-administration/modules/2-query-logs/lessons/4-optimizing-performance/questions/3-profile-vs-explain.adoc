= PROFILE vs EXPLAIN

What is the key difference between using `PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN` when analyzing query performance?

* [ ] PROFILE shows the query plan while EXPLAIN shows the results
* [ ] EXPLAIN is faster because it uses cached data
* [x] PROFILE executes the query and returns actual statistics while EXPLAIN only shows the planned execution
* [ ] PROFILE can only be used on read queries while EXPLAIN works on all queries

.Solution
====
The correct answer is **PROFILE executes the query and returns actual statistics while EXPLAIN only shows the planned execution**.

PROFILE runs the query and provides real performance metrics including actual database hits, rows processed, and time spent in each operation. EXPLAIN only shows the planned execution steps without running the query.
