= Query Prioritization

Which metric is most important when prioritizing queries for optimization?

* [ ] The longest single query duration
* [x] Total time spent (frequency × duration)
* [ ] The number of page faults
* [ ] The planning time

.Hint
====
Consider the overall impact on database resources, not just individual query speed.

.Solution
====
The correct answer is **Total time spent (frequency × duration)**.

This metric captures the overall impact of a query on your database. A frequently-run query with moderate duration often has more total impact than a rarely-run slow query.

**The longest single query duration** measures individual query speed but ignores how often it runs. **The number of page faults** indicates caching issues but doesn't measure total resource consumption. **The planning time** shows whether queries are parameterized but doesn't reflect execution impact.
