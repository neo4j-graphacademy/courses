= Query performance patterns

In the Summary view, you notice a query has a minimum execution time of 50ms but a maximum execution time of 5000ms. 

What does this large discrepancy most likely indicate?

* [ ] The query has syntax errors that occur intermittently
* [ ] The database is running out of memory
* [x] The query may be hitting dense nodes with many relationships
* [ ] The query is not using proper authentication

The lesson describes what a large difference between Min time and Max time columns indicates about query variability.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is **The query may be hitting dense nodes with many relationships**.

A large difference between the Min time and Max time columns is a good indicator of variability in query performance. This can be caused by various factors, such as the query running through a node with a high number of relationships which can be a sign that the data model should be refactored to improve performance.
