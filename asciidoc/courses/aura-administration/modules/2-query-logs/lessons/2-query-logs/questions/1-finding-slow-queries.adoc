= Choosing the right view

A user reported that their product search was slow yesterday at 2:30 PM. You want to see the exact queries that ran at that time, including which driver and user executed them. Which view should you use?

Select the correct answer.

* [ ] Summary view, because it shows aggregate statistics
* [x] Details view, because it shows individual query executions with timing and metadata
* [ ] Query timeline, because it shows spikes in activity
* [ ] Summary view sorted by Total time spent

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is **Details view, because it shows individual query executions with timing and metadata**.

The Details view shows individual query executions with additional information on a query-by-query basis, including the time it took to execute the query, the user who executed it, the driver that executed it, and the application that executed it. This view is useful when investigating specific issues, like what happened at a particular time.
