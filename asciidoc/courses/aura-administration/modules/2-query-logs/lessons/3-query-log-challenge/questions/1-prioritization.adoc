= Query Optimization Priority

Which query should you prioritize optimizing for the biggest impact?

* [x] Query A - consumes most total database time
* [ ] Query B - good candidate for indexing
* [ ] Query C - highest execution count
* [ ] All three need equal attention

.Solution
====
**Query A - consumes most total database time** is correct.

**Total impact calculation**:

**Query A**: 2,500 executions × 9 seconds = 22,500 seconds = **375 minutes**. These are the slowest queries (9 seconds each) with moderate frequency (2,500 times), creating a MASSIVE total impact (6+ hours of database time!).

**Query B**: 15,000 executions × 0.3 seconds = 4,500 seconds = **75 minutes**. These are fast queries (300ms each) with very high frequency (15,000 times), creating a moderate total impact.

**Query C**: 10,000 executions × 0.03 seconds = 300 seconds = **5 minutes**. These are very fast queries (30ms each) with high frequency (10,000 times), creating minimal total impact (performing excellently!).
