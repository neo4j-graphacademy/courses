= Managing Snapshots
:type: lesson
:order: 1

== Introduction

A **snapshot** is a point-in-time copy of your database. Like a photograph, it captures everything that exists at that moment.

In this lesson, you'll learn about snapshot types, how to access them, and retention policies for different Aura tiers.


== Snapshot Types

Aura provides two types of snapshots to help you protect your data and maintain operational flexibility.


=== Scheduled Snapshots

Scheduled snapshots run automatically - no manual intervention needed. Frequency depends on your tier.

For instances running the latest version of Neo4j, **AuraDB Professional** and **AuraDS Professional** create snapshots once per day. **AuraDB Business Critical** creates snapshots every hour. **AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud** creates both daily full snapshots and hourly differential snapshots. **AuraDS Enterprise** creates daily snapshots.

If you're running Virtual Dedicated Cloud instances on Neo4j 4.x, you'll get scheduled snapshots every 6 hours.

[NOTE]
.Full vs. Differential Snapshots
====
Understanding the difference between snapshot types is important for your recovery strategy. A **full snapshot** captures your entire database at a specific point in time - it's complete and self-contained. A **differential snapshot**, on the other hand, only records the changes since the last full snapshot, making it more efficient but dependent on the full snapshot that came before it.

Keep in mind that differential snapshots are not exportable and cannot be used to create new instances. They're designed purely for restore operations on your existing instance.
====


=== On Demand Snapshots

Create a snapshot anytime using the **Take snapshot** button in the Aura console. Useful before major changes or migrations.

For AuraDB Free instances, on demand snapshots are the only snapshot type available.


== Accessing Snapshots

To view and manage snapshots:

. Navigate to your Aura instance card in the console
. Click the more menu icon (**…**) on the instance card
. Select **Inspect**
. Select the **Snapshots** tab

The Snapshots tab displays a list of available snapshots with their creation time, type, and available actions.

Use the **Show exportable only** toggle to filter snapshots by whether they can be exported.


== Snapshot Actions

Each snapshot has three actions via the more menu (**…**): export, create instance, and restore.


=== Export

Export downloads a snapshot as a backup file for offline storage or use with other Neo4j installations.

**AuraDB instances** export as `.backup` files (latest version) or `.dump` files (version 4.x). **AuraDS instances** export as `.tar` files.

[IMPORTANT]
.Exportability Restrictions
====
There are some limits to be aware of. For Virtual Dedicated Cloud instances running Neo4j latest version, you can only export one full snapshot per day. This is by design to balance data protection with system resources.

Remember that differential backups cannot be exported at all - only full snapshots can be downloaded.
====


=== Create Instance from Snapshot

This creates a new instance with data from the snapshot. Your original instance remains unchanged.

Use this to test changes, debug production issues, or provide realistic test data without affecting production.


=== Restore

Restore reverts your instance to the snapshot state. Access via the arrow icon next to the more menu.

[WARNING]
.Overwriting existing data
====
Restoring **overwrites all current data** in your instance. The operation is destructive and irreversible.

To verify snapshot data without overwriting, create a new instance from the snapshot instead.
====


== Snapshot Retention

Different tiers offer different retention policies:

[NOTE]
.On-Demand Snapshot Retention
====
On-demand snapshots are restorable and exportable for the same period as the total retention for your tier.
====


== Best Practices

Take an on-demand snapshot before major database changes for a specific recovery point.

Test restore procedures regularly to confirm they work before you need them in production.

Download critical snapshots as backup files for recovery options independent of Aura.

Use **Show exportable only** filter to identify downloadable snapshots. Differential backups aren't exportable.

Understand your tier's retention policies - restorable versus exportable periods differ. Professional tier: 7 days for both. Higher tiers vary for full versus differential backups.

For testing or troubleshooting, create new instances from snapshots rather than restoring to production.

== Summary

You now know how to manage snapshots for your Aura instances.

You've learned about automatic snapshot schedules, retention policies, and how to access the Snapshots page in the Aura console.

Next up, you'll learn how to use snapshots to create test environments from production data.
