= Managing Snapshots
:type: lesson
:order: 1

== Introduction

The data in your Aura instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.

A **snapshot** is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

In this lesson, you will learn about snapshot types, how to access and manage them, and the retention policies for different Aura tiers.


== Snapshot Types

Aura provides two types of snapshots to help you protect your data and maintain operational flexibility.


=== Scheduled Snapshots

Scheduled snapshots run automatically based on your Aura tier without manual intervention.

The frequency depends on your tier. For instances running the latest version of Neo4j, **AuraDB Professional** and **AuraDS Professional** create snapshots once per day. **AuraDB Business Critical** creates snapshots every hour. **AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud** creates both daily full snapshots and hourly differential snapshots. **AuraDS Enterprise** creates daily snapshots.

If you're running Virtual Dedicated Cloud instances on Neo4j 4.x, you'll get scheduled snapshots every 6 hours.

[NOTE]
.Full vs. Differential Snapshots
====
Understanding the difference between snapshot types is important for your recovery strategy. A **full snapshot** captures your entire database at a specific point in time - it's complete and self-contained. A **differential snapshot**, on the other hand, only records the changes since the last full snapshot, making it more efficient but dependent on the full snapshot that came before it.

Keep in mind that differential snapshots are not exportable and cannot be used to create new instances. They're designed purely for restore operations on your existing instance.
====


=== On Demand Snapshots

On demand snapshots are manually triggered using the **Take snapshot** button in the Aura console. You can create them at any time.

For AuraDB Free instances, on demand snapshots are the only snapshot type available.


== Accessing Snapshots

To view and manage snapshots:

. Navigate to your Aura instance card in the console
. Click the more menu icon (**…**) on the instance card
. Select **Inspect**
. Select the **Snapshots** tab

The Snapshots tab displays a list of available snapshots with their creation time, type, and available actions.

Use the **Show exportable only** toggle to filter snapshots by whether they can be exported.


== Snapshot Actions

The more menu (**…**) next to each snapshot provides access to three actions: export, create instance, and restore.


=== Export

Exporting downloads a snapshot as a backup file for offline storage or use with other Neo4j installations. **AuraDB instances** export as `.backup` files (latest version) or `.dump` files (version 4.x). **AuraDS instances** export as `.tar` files.

Exported files provide data recovery options independent of Aura's infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
.Exportability Restrictions
====
There are some limits to be aware of. For Virtual Dedicated Cloud instances running Neo4j latest version, you can only export one full snapshot per day. This is by design to balance data protection with system resources.

Remember that differential backups cannot be exported at all - only full snapshots can be downloaded.
====


=== Create Instance from Snapshot

Creating a new instance from a snapshot produces an independent instance populated with data from the snapshot point in time. The original instance remains unchanged.

This enables testing changes, debugging production issues in isolation, and providing realistic test data without affecting production.


=== Restore

The restore action (accessed via the arrow icon next to the more menu) reverts the instance to the state captured in the snapshot.

[WARNING]
====
Restoring from a snapshot **overwrites** all current data in the instance, replacing it entirely with the snapshot data. The operation is destructive and irreversible.

The console requires confirmation before proceeding. To verify snapshot data without overwriting current data, create a new instance from the snapshot instead.
====


== Snapshot Retention

Different tiers offer different retention policies:

[NOTE]
.On-Demand Snapshot Retention
====
On-demand snapshots are restorable and exportable for the same period as the total retention for your tier.
====


== Best Practices

Effective snapshot management requires consistent operational procedures:

Take an on-demand snapshot before making major database changes. While automatic snapshots run on schedule, a snapshot immediately before a risky operation provides a specific recovery point.

Test restore procedures regularly. Restore a snapshot to a test instance and verify data integrity. This confirms that recovery processes function correctly before they're needed in production.

Download snapshots as backup files for critical data. This provides recovery options independent of Aura's infrastructure.

Use the **Show exportable only** filter in the Snapshots tab to identify downloadable snapshots. Differential backups are not exportable.

Understand your tier's retention policies, including the difference between restorable and exportable retention periods. Professional tier provides 7 days for both. Higher tiers have different periods for full versus differential backups.

Create new instances from snapshots for testing or troubleshooting rather than restoring to production instances. This maintains production stability during investigation.

== Summary

You learned how to manage snapshots for your Aura instances.

You learned about automatic snapshot schedules, retention policies, and how to access the Snapshots page in the Aura console.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to use snapshots to create test environments from production data.
