.Solution
====
The correct answer is **Daily**.

Aura Professional instances have automatic daily snapshots with 7-day retention.

Business Critical and Virtual Dedicated Cloud (latest version) have hourly differential snapshots plus daily full snapshots. Virtual Dedicated Cloud 4.x instances have snapshots every 6 hours.

Aura Free does not support automatic snapshots - only on-demand snapshots.
