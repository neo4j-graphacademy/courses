= Test Environment Strategy

What is the best course of action to provide a test environment for this scenario?

* [ ] Create a production-sized instance from a snapshot and leave it running for the week
* [x] Create a smaller test instance from a snapshot and delete it when testing is complete
* [ ] Give developers access to production for testing
* [ ] Create a new instance and manually import test data

Consider both the data volume needs and how to minimize costs during a week-long testing period with intermittent usage.

**Create a smaller test instance from a snapshot and delete it when testing is complete** is correct.

This is the most cost-effective approach because: **Create from snapshot** gets real production data (50GB), **Smaller instance** means test instances can be smaller than production (adequate for testing performance and functionality), **Delete when done** means you only pay for the instance while actively testing, and **Recreate as needed** means you can create new test instances from snapshots for additional test iterations.

Cost comparison for 1 week:

- Full-size instance running continuously: $$$$
- Smaller instance, deleted after testing: $-$$
- Production access: Free but EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
- Manual data import: Time-consuming and data may not reflect production characteristics

Why the alternatives have drawbacks: Full-size instance running continuously is unnecessarily expensive, production testing risks data corruption and user impact (NEVER do this), and manual import is time-consuming and may not replicate production data patterns.

**Best practices**: Use clear naming (e.g., `test-migration-2024-11-07`), choose an appropriate smaller size for testing (doesn't need to match production), consider anonymizing sensitive data if required by compliance, delete the instance promptly when testing is complete, and document which snapshot was used for the test instance.
