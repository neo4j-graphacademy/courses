= Recovering from Data Deletion

What is the best course of action to recover from this situation?

* [ ] Wait for tonight's automatic snapshot and restore from that

* [x] Create a new instance from the 1:00 AM snapshot and manually replay changes

* [ ] Upgrade to Business Critical tier for hourly snapshots first

* [ ] Ask developers to recreate the deleted data manually

Consider what data you have available right now in your snapshots, and what actions you can take immediately to restore service.

**Create a new instance from the 1:00 AM snapshot and manually replay changes** is correct.

This is the best immediate action because you have a snapshot from before the deletion (1:00 AM), creating a new instance preserves your current production instance, you can compare the two instances to identify what was deleted, you can then manually restore the missing data to production, and this minimizes risk while giving you recovery options.

Why the alternatives don't work: Waiting for tonight's snapshot means 24+ hours of downtime (unacceptable), upgrading tiers doesn't help recover already-deleted data, and manual recreation is error-prone and time-consuming without a reference.

**Note**: The new instance will have data as it was at 1:00 AM. Changes made between 1:00 AM and 2:15 PM (13 hours) won't be in that snapshot. You may need to replay those changes from application logs.

For future prevention, consider upgrading to Business Critical tier for hourly snapshots if this type of incident poses significant business risk.
