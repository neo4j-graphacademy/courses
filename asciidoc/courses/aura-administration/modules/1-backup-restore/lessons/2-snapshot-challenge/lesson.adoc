== Scenario

You are the database administrator for an e-commerce platform running on Aura Professional.

The development team has reported that they accidentally deleted critical product category data in production at 2:15 PM today.

Your instance has automatic daily snapshots enabled with 7-day retention.

The last successful snapshot was taken at 1:00 AM this morning, before the accidental deletion occurred.

== Summary

When accidental data deletion occurs, the best approach is to create a new instance from the most recent snapshot before the incident.

This preserves your current state while giving you a recovery option.

For Business Critical tier with hourly differential snapshots, you would have backups much closer to the incident time, minimizing data loss.

This scenario highlights the importance of understanding your snapshot schedule and retention policy for your tier.
