= Understanding Restore Operations

What happens when you restore an Aura instance from a snapshot or backup file?

* [ ] The new data is merged with existing data in the instance

* [x] All existing data is overwritten and replaced with the snapshot/backup data

* [ ] Only deleted data is restored, existing data remains unchanged

* [ ] The restore creates a new instance automatically to preserve existing data

.Solution
====
**All existing data is overwritten and replaced with the snapshot/backup data** is correct.

Both restore operations - restoring from a snapshot and uploading a backup file - completely **overwrite all data** in your instance.

This means:

* Your current data is completely replaced
* You cannot undo this operation
* You should create a new instance instead if you need to preserve existing data


**Best practice**: If you're uncertain about losing current data, create a new instance from the snapshot instead of restoring to an existing instance. This preserves your current data while giving you access to the snapshot data.
