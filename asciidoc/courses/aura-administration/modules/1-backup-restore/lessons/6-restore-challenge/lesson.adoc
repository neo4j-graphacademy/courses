=  Restore Decision
:type: challenge
:order: 6


== Scenario

At 3:00 PM on Friday, your monitoring alerts show that failed queries have spiked from 0.1% to 45% of all queries over the past hour.

Investigation reveals that a deployment at 2:00 PM introduced a data migration that corrupted relationship properties affecting millions of edges.

Your application is currently experiencing severe issues and users cannot complete critical business operations.

You have:

* Automatic snapshots from 1:00 AM today (before the deployment)
* The ability to restore from snapshot (requires 30-45 minutes downtime)
* A development team that says they "might" be able to fix the data corruption with a script in 2-3 hours

== Summary

In production incidents affecting users, restoring from a known good backup is often the fastest path to recovery.

Key decision factors:

* **Severity**: 45% query failure rate is severe and affecting users
* **Recovery time**: Restore takes 45 minutes (known) vs. fix takes 2-3 hours (estimated)
* **Risk**: Restore is proven vs. fix script is uncertain
* **Data loss**: 13 hours of data needs to be replayed or accepted as lost

Best practice: Restore to recover service, then investigate how to replay lost changes from logs or application records.

Always communicate with stakeholders about data loss and coordinate before executing the restore.
