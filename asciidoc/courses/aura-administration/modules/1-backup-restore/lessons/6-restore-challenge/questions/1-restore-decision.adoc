= Production Incident Response

What is the best course of action to respond to this production incident?

* [ ] Wait for the development team to create a fix script

* [x] Restore from 1:00 AM snapshot to recover service immediately

* [ ] Roll back the application deployment and investigate

* [ ] Contact Neo4j support for guidance

Consider the severity (45% query failure), the certainty of each option, and the business impact of extended downtime.

.Solution

**Restore from 1:00 AM snapshot to recover service immediately** is correct.

This is the best immediate action because:

**Severity**: 45% query failure is critical - users can't work. **Certainty**: Restore takes 30-45 minutes (known time), while a "fix script" might work in "2-3 hours" (uncertain). **Business impact**: Friday afternoon means you need service restored ASAP.

**Restore timeline**: Start restore at 3:00 PM, complete restore at 3:30-3:45 PM, and service is restored with data from 1:00 AM.

**Trade-off**: Lose 13 hours of data (1:00 AM to 2:00 PM).

**After restore**: Service is back online, users can work, the team can investigate how to replay lost transactions from logs, and you can deploy a fixed version in a controlled manner.

Why waiting or rolling back the application won't work: Waiting 2-3 hours (maybe) means users suffer longer, app rollback doesn't fix already-corrupted data, and support can't fix this immediately.

**Best practice**: In production incidents with severe user impact:
1. Restore service first (restore from backup)
2. Accept data loss if necessary
3. Investigate replay/recovery options after service is restored
4. Document and communicate data loss to stakeholders

**Key principle**: Known, fast recovery > uncertain, slow fixes during outages.
