= Compaction Decision

You observe:

. Allocated space: 500GB
. Used space: 280GB
. Difference: 220GB (44% unused)

This occurred after a major data cleanup where 3 million nodes were deleted last month.

When should you perform database compaction?

* [ ] Never - the space will be reused automatically

* [ ] Immediately - any unused space should be reclaimed

* [x] When ready for planned downtime - the 44% gap justifies compaction

* [ ] Wait until the gap reaches 75%

**When ready for planned downtime - the 44% gap justifies compaction** is correct.

Compaction guidance: **Small gap (<30%)** is normal with no action needed, **Large gap (>30-40%)** means compaction is beneficial, and **Very large gap (>50%)** means compaction is recommended.

At 44% unused space (220GB), compaction is justified because there's significant wasted storage (220GB), storage costs are accumulating, space after major deletions won't be reused quickly, and 44% is well above the 30-40% threshold.

**Compaction benefits**: Reclaim 220GB of storage, reduce storage costs, and gain slight performance improvement. **Important**: Compaction requires downtime, so plan during a maintenance window.

Why the other answers are wrong: Space after major deletions won't be reused efficiently, you don't need to compact immediately (plan for a maintenance window), and 44% already justifies compaction (don't wait for 75%).

**When to compact**: When there's a large gap between allocated and used space (>30-40%), after major data deletions, when storage costs are a concern, or during scheduled maintenance windows.
