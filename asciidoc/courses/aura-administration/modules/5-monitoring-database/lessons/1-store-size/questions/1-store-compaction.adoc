.Solution
====
**Allocated space is significantly larger than used space after major deletions** is correct.

A large difference indicates storage waste from deleted data that hasn't been reclaimed. Compaction would reclaim this unused space and potentially reduce storage costs.

**Equal spaces** would indicate no waste. **Slightly larger allocated space** is normal due to Neo4j's allocation strategy. **Growing used space** indicates data growth, not waste.
