= Replan Event Causes

What is the primary cause of consistently high replan rates?

* [ ] Too many schema changes
* [x] Queries not using parameters
* [ ] Insufficient memory
* [ ] Heavy write load

====
Consider how query plan caching works and what prevents plan reuse.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Queries not using parameters** is correct.

When queries use literal values instead of parameters, each unique value triggers a new execution plan. This prevents Neo4j from reusing cached plans and causes unnecessary replanning. Using parameterized queries allows the database to reuse the same plan for all executions.

**Too many schema changes** cause occasional spikes, not consistent high rates. **Insufficient memory** affects query execution but not plan caching. **Heavy write load** may trigger more frequent checkpoints but doesn't directly cause replan events.
