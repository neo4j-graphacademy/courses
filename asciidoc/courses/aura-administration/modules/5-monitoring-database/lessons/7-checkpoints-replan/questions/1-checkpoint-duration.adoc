= Checkpoint Duration Threshold

In Aura, what checkpoint duration value warrants investigation?

* [ ] Over 1 minute
* [ ] Over 5 minutes
* [x] Over 10 minutes
* [ ] Over 30 minutes

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Checkpoints typically run every 15 minutes or every 100,000 transactions. Normal checkpoints take several seconds to several minutes. Aura has a lower threshold than self-managed Neo4j.

.Solution
====
**Over 10 minutes** is correct for Aura.

Checkpoint duration consistently over 10 minutes in Aura indicates potential issues such as I/O problems, heavy write load, or storage performance problems. This threshold signals that the checkpoint process is taking significantly longer than the expected several seconds to several minutes.

**Over 1 minute** and **over 5 minutes** are within normal ranges for checkpoints. **Over 30 minutes** is the threshold for self-managed Neo4j deployments, but Aura uses a lower 10-minute threshold due to the managed infrastructure.
