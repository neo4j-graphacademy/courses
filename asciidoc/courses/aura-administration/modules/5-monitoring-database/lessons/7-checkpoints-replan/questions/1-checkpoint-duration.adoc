.Solution
====
**Over 30 minutes** is correct.

Checkpoint duration over 30 minutes indicates potential issues such as I/O problems, heavy write load, or storage performance problems. This threshold signals that the checkpoint process is taking significantly longer than the expected several seconds to several minutes.

**Over 5 minutes** and **over 10 minutes** are within normal ranges for checkpoints. **Over 60 minutes** is too high a threshold and would miss performance issues that should be investigated earlier.
