= Understanding Latency Percentiles

What does a large gap between the 50th percentile and 99th percentile latency indicate?

* [ ] The database needs more memory

* [ ] Network connectivity is unreliable

* [x] Specific slow queries need optimization rather than scaling

* [ ] All queries are performing poorly

Consider what it means when most queries are fast but the slowest ones are much slower.

**Specific slow queries need optimization rather than scaling** is correct.

A large gap indicates most queries execute quickly (low median) but a small percentage are very slow (high 99th percentile). This pattern shows the instance handles queries well overall, but specific queries are outliers needing optimization. Scaling won't fix inefficient queries.

**More memory** would affect all queries uniformly. **Network issues** would impact all percentiles. **All queries performing poorly** would show high values across all percentiles.
