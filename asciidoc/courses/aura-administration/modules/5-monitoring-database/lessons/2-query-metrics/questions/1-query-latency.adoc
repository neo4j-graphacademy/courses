= Query Latency Interpretation

Your database metrics show:

. 50th percentile latency: 35ms
. 75th percentile latency: 95ms
. 99th percentile latency: 8,200ms
. Failed queries: <1%

What does this tell you?

* [ ] Overall performance is excellent - no action needed

* [ ] The database needs scaling immediately

* [x] Most queries are fast, but specific slow queries need optimization

* [ ] Network latency is causing issues

Compare the 50th percentile (median) to the 99th percentile. What does a large gap indicate?

**Most queries are fast, but specific slow queries need optimization** is correct.

Latency analysis: **50th percentile: 35ms** is excellent (half of queries are very fast), **75th percentile: 95ms** is good (75% of queries under 100ms), and **99th percentile: 8,200ms** is a problem (slowest 1% taking 8+ seconds). **The gap** between median (35ms) and 99th percentile (8,200ms) is huge - over 200x difference!

This pattern indicates the database and instance are performing well overall, but specific queries (the slowest 1%) are extremely slow, these outlier queries need optimization, and scaling won't fix poorly written queries.

**Action**:
1. Filter query logs for duration > 5000ms
2. Identify the specific slow queries
3. Optimize those queries (add indexes, rewrite, etc.)
4. Measure improvement

Why the other answers are wrong: Can't ignore 8-second queries affecting users, scaling won't fix inefficient queries, and network latency would affect all queries, not just 1%.

**Key lesson**: When 99th percentile is much higher than median, optimize specific queries rather than scaling.
