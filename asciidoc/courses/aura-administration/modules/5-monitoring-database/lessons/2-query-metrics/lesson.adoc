== Introduction

Query performance directly affects user experience. Slow queries frustrate users, while failed queries may indicate application problems or resource constraints.

In this lesson, you will learn how to monitor query rates, failed queries, and query latency percentiles.

== Understanding Query Metrics

Aura provides two types of query metrics at the database level to help you monitor performance.

**Query rate** shows how many queries execute per minute. This includes both successful queries and failed queries. Query rate helps you understand database load and identify unusual patterns like sudden spikes or drops.

**Query latency** shows how long queries take to execute, measured in percentiles. The _50th percentile_, or the median query time shows typical performance, the _75th percentile_ shows how most queries perform, and the _99th percentile_ captures your slowest queries.

// UI Description: Queries per minute is the number of successful queries executed per minute on this database.

// UI Description: Failed queries per minute is the number of failed queries executed per minute on this database.

// UI Description: The query execution time in milliseconds where 50% of queries executed faster than the
// reported time. This also corresponds to the median of the query execution time. Available from Neo4j Version 5.

// UI Description: The query execution time in milliseconds where 75% of queries executed faster than the
// reported time. Available from Neo4j Version 5.

== Monitoring Query Performance

Monitor both query rate and latency together to understand database health.

As a general guideline, failed queries should be very low, typically less than 1% of total queries. High failed query rates indicate application errors, syntax problems, permission issues, or resource constraints causing timeouts. Review query logs to identify failing queries and their root causes.

A stable or gradually increasing query rate with low latency indicates a healthy database. Sudden changes in query rate may indicate new deployments, application issues, or connectivity problems.

For query latency, a low 50th percentile, for example under 100ms, generally indicates typical queries are fast. If the 99th percentile is much higher than the median, specific queries need optimization rather than scaling the instance. A wide spread between percentiles indicates inconsistent query performance.

== Interpreting Query Patterns

Different patterns reveal different issues and require different actions.

**High query rate with increasing latency** indicates resource pressure. The database may be handling more load than it can process efficiently. Review CPU, memory, and page cache metrics to identify bottlenecks.

**Low failed queries with high 99th percentile latency** indicates specific slow queries need optimization. Most queries work well, but outliers affect user experience. Use query logs to identify and optimize the slowest queries.

**Increasing failed queries over time** indicates growing problems. Resource pressure may cause query timeouts, or application issues may be spreading. Investigate failed queries immediately to prevent further degradation.

== When You Should Optimize or Scale

Use query metrics to decide between optimization and scaling.

If the 99th percentile latency is very high, as a guideline more than 10x the median, you should optimize specific queries first. Scaling won't fix poorly written queries. Review query logs for duration above your threshold and add indexes or rewrite queries.

If all percentiles are high, you have systemic performance issues. Review all instance metrics including CPU, memory, and page cache before scaling. The instance may be undersized for your workload.

Monitor query metrics before and after making changes to validate improvements. Set latency targets based on your specific use case, for example under 100ms for user-facing queries or under 5 seconds for reports. These thresholds will vary depending on your application requirements and user expectations.

== Summary

Query rate and latency metrics help you monitor database performance. Failed queries should be very low, and the 99th percentile latency reveals slow queries that impact user experience. A large gap between median and 99th percentile indicates specific queries need optimization rather than scaling.

In the next lesson, you will learn about monitoring transactions and identifying transaction issues.
