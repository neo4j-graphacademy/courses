= Interpreting Rollback Rates

Your database shows 200 committed transactions per minute and 12 rolled back transactions per minute. What does this indicate?

* [ ] The database is performing normally
* [x] You should investigate application errors or constraint violations
* [ ] The instance needs to be scaled immediately
* [ ] Rollback rates are too low and should be higher

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Consider what percentage 12 rollbacks represents out of 200 commits and whether that's within the normal range.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**You should investigate application errors or constraint violations** is correct.

With 12 rollbacks out of 200 commits, the rollback rate is 6%, which exceeds the expected 5% threshold. This indicates problems with your application code, constraint violations from duplicate data, or concurrent update conflicts. Review your query logs filtered by "status: failed" to identify which queries are failing and why.

**Performing normally** would show rollback rates under 5%. **Needs scaling** is incorrect because rollbacks indicate application logic issues, not capacity problems. **Too low** is backwards - lower rollback rates are better.
