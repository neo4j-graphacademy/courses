= Understanding Active Transaction Patterns

What indicates that active transactions might not be closing properly?

* [ ] Active transactions increase during peak hours

* [ ] Active transactions fluctuate throughout the day

* [x] Active transactions continuously grow during low activity periods

* [ ] Active transactions return to baseline after workload spikes

Consider when growing active transactions would be expected versus when they indicate a problem.

.Solution
====
**Active transactions continuously grow during low activity periods** is correct.

While increases during high activity are normal, continuous growth during periods of low activity indicates transactions are not being closed properly. This suggests a connection leak where sessions or transactions remain open indefinitely. Always ensure sessions are closed using try-with-resources or context managers, and that transactions are explicitly committed or rolled back.

**Increase during peak hours**, **fluctuate throughout the day**, and **return to baseline** all describe normal, healthy transaction patterns that reflect changing workload levels.
