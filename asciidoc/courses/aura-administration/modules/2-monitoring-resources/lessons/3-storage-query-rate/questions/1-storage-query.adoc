= Storage and Query Rate Analysis

You're analyzing metrics and notice:

1. Storage has grown steadily from 200GB to 500GB over 3 months
2. Query rate has remained stable at 1,000 queries/minute

What does this pattern indicate?

* [ ] The instance is misconfigured and needs attention
* [x] Write-heavy workload with stable read patterns
* [ ] Query performance is degrading
* [ ] Database compaction is urgently needed

====
Consider what causes storage to grow while query rate stays the same. What types of operations add data without increasing query volume?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Write-heavy workload with stable read patterns** is correct.

This pattern indicates data is being added regularly (storage growing) while read query volume hasn't changed (stable query rate). This is typical of applications with continuous data ingestion, such as logging systems, IoT data collection, or event streaming. This is a normal, healthy pattern for certain workload types.

Why the other answers are wrong: Nothing indicates misconfiguration (this is normal for some applications), query performance issues would show in latency metrics not query rate, and compaction is only needed when there's a large gap between allocated and used space, which isn't indicated here.

**Action:** Monitor trends to plan for future storage scaling as data continues to grow.
