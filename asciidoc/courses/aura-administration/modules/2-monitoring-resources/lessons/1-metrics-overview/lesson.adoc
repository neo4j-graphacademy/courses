== Introduction

The Metrics dashboard is your primary tool for monitoring the health and performance of your Aura instances.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to navigate the Metrics dashboard and understand the three main monitoring categories: Resources, Instance, and Database.


== Accessing the Metrics Dashboard

To access the Metrics dashboard:

. Navigate to your Aura instance in the console
. Click on the instance name
. Select the **Metrics** tab

The Metrics dashboard provides real-time and historical data about your instance's performance.


== Dashboard Layout

The Metrics dashboard has three tabs:

**Resources**: High-level resource utilization (CPU, storage, query rate). Use for capacity health checks.

**Instance**: Neo4j instance metrics (memory, connection pools, garbage collection). Use to evaluate Neo4j performance.

**Database**: Database-specific metrics (store size, transactions, query latency). Use for query performance and data growth analysis.

Switch between tabs to investigate issues or track trends.


== Dashboard Controls

The Metrics dashboard includes several controls for customizing your view:


=== Date Range Filter

Choose from preset ranges (15 min, 1 hr, 6 hr, 24 hr, 7 days, 30 days) or define a custom range.

[TIP]
.Choosing the right time range
====
**Troubleshooting active issues**: Use 15 min to 1 hour for real-time visibility.

**Trend analysis and capacity planning**: Use 7 to 30 days to identify growth trends and recurring patterns.
====


=== Refresh

The refresh button updates all metrics with the latest data.

Metrics are automatically refreshed, but you can manually refresh for immediate updates when troubleshooting issues.


=== Detail View

Splits chart bars by availability zone (e.g., `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`).

Use this to spot region-specific issues. If one zone shows degraded performance while others are normal, it's an infrastructure issue, not application.


== Understanding Metric Charts

Each metric chart displays time series data (values over the selected time period), the current value (most recent measurement), the metric name, and the unit of measurement (cores, bytes, percentage, etc.).


=== Reading Time Series Charts

The dashboard uses different chart types for different metrics. Line charts show trends over time (e.g., CPU usage). Area charts display cumulative metrics (e.g., storage). Bar charts show discrete values (e.g., transaction counts per minute).

Chart type affects data interpretation. Interpret spikes according to the visualization method.


== When to Check Metrics

Establish a regular metrics review schedule:

**Daily**: Perform health checks on production instances to identify issues before they escalate.

**Before/after changes**: Compare metrics when making configuration changes to measure impact.

**During incidents**: Use metrics to identify root causes of performance issues.

**For capacity planning**: Analyze trends over time to predict future capacity requirements and identify growth patterns.


[NOTE]
.Tier-specific metrics
====
Not all metrics are available for all Aura tiers.

Some advanced metrics require Aura Professional or higher.

== Interpreting Metrics

When you're looking at metrics, you're watching for four types of changes:

**Spikes**: These are sudden increases that might indicate problems. A CPU spike might mean you have an inefficient query. A spike in failed queries means users are hitting errors right now.

**Trends**: These are gradual changes over time - like storage filling up or query latency increasing. Trends give you advance warning before you hit capacity limits.

**Patterns**: These are recurring behaviors specific to your workload - like daily peaks during business hours or weekly spikes. Understanding your normal patterns helps you avoid false alarms.

**Anomalies**: These are unexpected values or behaviors that don't match your established patterns. Anomalies typically mean something needs investigation.

Make sure you establish baseline metrics for your workload. What's normal for one system might be abnormal for another.

== Summary

You now know how to navigate the Metrics dashboard for your Aura instances.

You've learned about the three main monitoring categories - Resources, Instance, and Database - and how to use dashboard controls to customize your view.

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to monitor CPU usage and identify performance bottlenecks.
