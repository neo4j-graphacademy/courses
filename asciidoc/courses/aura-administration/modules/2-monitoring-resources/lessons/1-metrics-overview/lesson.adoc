== Introduction

The Metrics dashboard is your primary tool for monitoring the health and performance of your Aura instances.

In this lesson, you will learn how to navigate the Metrics dashboard and understand the three main monitoring categories: Resources, Instance, and Database.


== Accessing the Metrics Dashboard

To access the Metrics dashboard:

. Navigate to your Aura instance in the console
. Click on the instance name
. Select the **Metrics** tab

The Metrics dashboard provides real-time and historical data about your instance's performance.


== Dashboard Layout

The Metrics dashboard is organized into three tabs, each displaying different categories of metrics.

The **Resources** tab displays high-level resource utilization: CPU, storage, and query rate. Use this tab for capacity health checks.

The **Instance** tab displays Neo4j instance-level metrics: memory usage, connection pools, and garbage collection. Use this tab to evaluate Neo4j performance.

The **Database** tab displays database-specific metrics: store size, transaction counts, and query latency percentiles. Use this tab for query performance analysis and data growth monitoring.

Each tab contains multiple time-series charts. Switch between tabs to investigate issues or track trends.


== Dashboard Controls

The Metrics dashboard includes several controls for customizing your view:


=== Date Range Filter

The date range filter lets you zoom in or out on your metrics timeline. You can choose from preset ranges - 15 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days - or define a custom date range if you need to look at a specific period.

[TIP]
.Choosing the right time range
====
Time range selection depends on the monitoring objective.

For troubleshooting active issues, use shorter ranges (15 minutes to 1 hour). This provides real-time visibility with sufficient detail to identify patterns.

For trend analysis and capacity planning, use longer ranges (7 to 30 days). This identifies growth trends, recurring patterns (daily or weekly spikes), and capacity adequacy.
====


=== Refresh

The refresh button updates all metrics with the latest data.

Metrics are automatically refreshed, but you can manually refresh for immediate updates when troubleshooting issues.


=== Detail View

Detail view splits chart bars by availability zone, showing metrics for each region separately (e.g., `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`).

This enables identification of region-specific issues. If one availability zone shows degraded performance while others remain normal, this indicates infrastructure rather than application problems. Detail view also shows cluster member performance and geographic workload distribution.


== Understanding Metric Charts

Each metric chart displays time series data (values over the selected time period), the current value (most recent measurement), the metric name, and the unit of measurement (cores, bytes, percentage, etc.).


=== Reading Time Series Charts

The dashboard uses different chart types for different metrics. Line charts show trends over time (e.g., CPU usage). Area charts display cumulative metrics (e.g., storage). Bar charts show discrete values (e.g., transaction counts per minute).

Chart type affects data interpretation. Interpret spikes according to the visualization method.


== When to Check Metrics

Establish a regular metrics review schedule:

**Daily**: Perform health checks on production instances to identify issues before they escalate.

**Before/after changes**: Compare metrics when making configuration changes to measure impact.

**During incidents**: Use metrics to identify root causes of performance issues.

**For capacity planning**: Analyze trends over time to predict future capacity requirements and identify growth patterns.


[NOTE]
.Tier-specific metrics
====
Not all metrics are available for all Aura tiers.

Some advanced metrics require Aura Professional or higher.

== Interpreting Metrics

Metric interpretation focuses on identifying four types of changes:

**Spikes**: Sudden increases indicating potential issues. CPU spikes may indicate inefficient queries. Failed query spikes indicate active user-facing errors.

**Trends**: Gradual changes over time, such as storage filling up or query latency increasing. Trends provide advance warning before capacity limits are reached.

**Patterns**: Recurring behaviors specific to the workload, such as daily peaks during business hours or weekly spikes. Understanding normal patterns prevents false alarms.

**Anomalies**: Unexpected values or behaviors that deviate from established patterns. Anomalies typically indicate issues requiring investigation.

Establish baseline metrics for your workload. Normal behavior varies between systems.

== Summary

You learned how to navigate the Metrics dashboard for your Aura instances.

You learned about the three main monitoring categories (Resources, Instance, Database) and how to use dashboard controls to customize your view.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to monitor CPU usage and identify performance bottlenecks.
