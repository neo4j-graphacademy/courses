.Solution
====
**Database** is correct.

The Metrics dashboard has three tabs: **Resources** (high-level metrics like CPU, storage, and query rate), **Instance** (Neo4j instance-level metrics like memory, connections, and GC), and **Database** (database-specific metrics including store size, transactions, and query latency).

Query latency percentiles (50th, 75th, 99th) are database-level metrics found in the Database tab.
