= Connection Churn Indicator

What indicates high connection churn that suggests connection pooling is not configured properly?

* [ ] High number of idle connections with low open/close rates
* [ ] Running connections that increase during high activity
* [x] High open and close rates with few idle connections
* [ ] Balanced open and close rates over time

Think about what happens when connections are created for every query instead of being reused.

**High open and close rates with few idle connections** is correct.

High connection churn occurs when applications constantly create and close connections instead of reusing them from a pool. This creates high open and close rates with few connections sitting idle in a pool. Connection churn is expensive because establishing new connections requires authentication, network setup, and resource allocation.

**High idle connections with low rates** indicates good pooling. **Running connections increasing** is normal workload scaling. **Balanced open/close rates** is healthy when combined with stable idle connections.
