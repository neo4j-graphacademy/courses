= Connection Pool Purpose

What is the primary purpose of using connection pools with Neo4j?

* [ ] To increase the maximum number of concurrent queries
* [x] To reuse connections and reduce connection establishment overhead
* [ ] To automatically close connections after each query
* [ ] To prevent connection leaks in application code

Think about why establishing a new connection for every query would be inefficient.

.Solution
====
**To reuse connections and reduce connection establishment overhead** is correct.

Connection pools maintain idle connections that can be reused for multiple queries. Establishing a new connection for every query is expensive because it requires authentication, network setup, and resource allocation. Reusing connections from a pool eliminates this overhead.

**Increasing concurrent queries** is not the primary purpose; that depends on instance limits. **Automatically closing connections** is incorrect; pools keep connections open for reuse. **Preventing connection leaks** is an application responsibility, not a pool feature.
