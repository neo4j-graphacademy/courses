= Connection Pool Health

You observe these Bolt connection metrics:

. Running connections: 20 (varies with workload)
. Idle connections: 80 (stable)
. Opened rate: 25/minute
. Closed rate: 25/minute

What does this indicate?

* [ ] Connection leak - opened rate is too high
* [x] Healthy connection pooling with efficient reuse
* [ ] Connection pool is too large
* [ ] Application needs to increase pool size

Look at the relationship between running, idle, and the open/close rates. What pattern indicates healthy connection pooling?

**Healthy connection pooling with efficient reuse** is correct.

This is a healthy pattern because the pool maintains ready connections (**Stable idle connections: 80**), there's normal turnover (**Balanced open/close rates: 25/min each**, not excessive), running connections vary with workload (normal query execution), and there's **Low churn** (connections are being reused, not constantly recreated).

Healthy connection pooling looks like idle connections available in the pool, low balanced open/close rates, running connections scaling with workload, and efficient resource usage.

Why the other answers are wrong: 25/minute is low, not high (connection leak would show 500+ opens/minute), 80 idle connections is reasonable (not excessive), and the pool is working well (no need to increase size).

Compare to unhealthy patterns: **Connection leak** shows 500+ opens/min with few idle connections, **No pooling** shows very high open/close rates (same as query rate), and **Pool exhaustion** shows no idle connections with connection timeouts.

This pattern shows proper connection pool configuration and usage.
