= Heap Memory Threshold

What does sustained heap memory usage above 80% indicate?

* [ ] Normal operation for complex workloads
* [ ] The garbage collector is working efficiently
* [x] Memory pressure requiring optimization or scaling
* [ ] Temporary spike that will resolve automatically

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Memory pressure requiring optimization or scaling** is correct.

Sustained heap usage above 80% indicates memory pressure that causes increased garbage collection, slower queries, and risk of Out of Memory errors. The expected baseline is 20-50% with temporary spikes to 60-80%.

**Normal operation** is incorrect because sustained high usage is not normal. **Efficient garbage collector** is wrong because high heap usage increases garbage collection frequency. **Temporary spike** is incorrect because sustained means it persists, not resolves automatically.
