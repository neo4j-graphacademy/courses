= Optimizing Heap Usage

What is the recommended first step when heap usage is consistently above 80%?

* [ ] Immediately scale the instance to a larger size
* [x] Optimize queries and transaction management
* [ ] Restart the instance to clear memory
* [ ] Reduce the number of concurrent connections

====
Inefficient queries will consume memory regardless of instance size.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct course of action is to **Optimize queries and transaction management**.

Always investigate and optimize your query patterns before scaling, as inefficient queries will eventually consume any amount of memory. Use `LIMIT` clauses, batch operations, and keep transactions short-lived to reduce heap memory usage.

It would be premature to scale the instance without optimization. Restarting the instance only temporarily clears memory but doesn't fix the underlying cause. Reducing connections doesn't address query or transaction issues consuming heap memory.
