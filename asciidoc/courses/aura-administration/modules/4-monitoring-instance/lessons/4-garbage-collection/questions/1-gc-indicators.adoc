= Garbage Collection Indicators

What does frequent old generation garbage collection indicate about your instance?

* [ ] Queries are creating too many temporary objects
* [ ] Young generation memory is too small
* [x] Long-lived objects are consuming most of the heap
* [ ] The database needs to be restarted

Consider what type of objects are stored in the old generation.

.Solution
====
**Long-lived objects are consuming most of the heap** is correct.

Old generation garbage collection handles long-lived objects like cached data and transaction state. When old generation collections become frequent, it indicates these objects are consuming most of the available heap memory, and the JVM is working hard to reclaim space.

**Queries creating temporary objects** affect young generation, not old generation. **Young generation size** would cause frequent young generation collections, not old generation collections. **Restarting the database** does not address the underlying memory capacity issue.
