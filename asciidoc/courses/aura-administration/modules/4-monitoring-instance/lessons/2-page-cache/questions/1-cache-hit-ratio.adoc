= Page Cache Hit Ratio Target

Your page cache hit ratio has dropped to 92% and usage ratio is at 100%.

What does this indicate?

* [ ] Performance is excellent - no action needed

* [ ] The database has a configuration error

* [x] The graph is larger than available memory - consider scaling

* [ ] Queries are poorly written

What is the target range for page cache hit ratio? What does it mean when the usage ratio is at 100%?

**The graph is larger than available memory - consider scaling** is correct.

Page cache hit ratio analysis: **Ideal** is 98-100% (graph fits in memory), **Good** is 90-98% (mostly fits), and **Poor** is <90% (significant disk reads).

At 92% with 100% usage ratio, the entire page cache is in use, hit ratio is declining because the graph doesn't fully fit, many queries are reading from disk (slow), and performance is degraded. This indicates the database has grown beyond available page cache memory.

**Solution**: Scale to a larger instance with more memory so the graph fits in the page cache.

Why the other answers are wrong: 92% is below the ideal 98-100% target, nothing indicates configuration error (this is a capacity issue), and while some queries might benefit from optimization, the root cause is insufficient memory for the data size.

The ideal state is 98-100% hit ratio with the full graph in memory.
