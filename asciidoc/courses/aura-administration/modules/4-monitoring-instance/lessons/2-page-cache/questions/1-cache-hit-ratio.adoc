= Page Cache Hit Ratio

What does the page cache hit ratio measure?

* [ ] The percentage of queries that complete successfully
* [ ] The amount of memory allocated to the page cache
* [x] The percentage of times data was found in memory versus read from disk
* [ ] The number of cache evictions per minute

**The percentage of times data was found in memory versus read from disk** is correct.

The hit ratio measures how often data is already in the page cache (cache hit) versus needing to be read from disk (cache miss). A high hit ratio means most data is found in memory, which is much faster than disk reads.

**Query completion** measures success rate, not cache performance. **Memory allocation** is measured by the usage ratio, not the hit ratio. **Cache evictions** are a separate metric that tracks how often data is replaced in memory.
