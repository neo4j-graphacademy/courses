= Page Cache Metrics Relationship

When the page cache usage ratio reaches 100%, what typically happens to the hit ratio?

* [ ] It improves because the cache is fully utilized
* [ ] It stays the same because they are independent metrics
* [x] It may start declining as data is constantly evicted and reloaded
* [ ] It immediately drops to zero

.Solution
====
**It may start declining as data is constantly evicted and reloaded** is correct.

When the usage ratio reaches 100%, the entire page cache is full. If queries need data that isn't cached, Neo4j must evict existing data to make room. This constant cycle of evicting and reloading data causes more cache misses, which lowers the hit ratio.

**Improving** is incorrect because a full cache leads to more evictions. **Staying the same** is incorrect because the metrics are related through memory availability. **Dropping to zero** is incorrect because some data remains cached even during constant eviction cycles.
