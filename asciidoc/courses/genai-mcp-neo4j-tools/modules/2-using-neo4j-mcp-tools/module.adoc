= Using Neo4j MCP Tools 
:order: 2

In this module, we will take a look at some of the MCP tools offered by Neo4j and how you can use them to build applications.

We will use the `mcp-neo4j-cypher` server to query the movies recommendations dataset and use the Filesystem MCP server from the previous module to save the files to disk.
