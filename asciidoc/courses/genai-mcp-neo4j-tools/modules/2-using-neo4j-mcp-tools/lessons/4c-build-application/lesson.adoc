= Building applications with MCP tools
:type: challenge 
:order: 4
:optional: true

In the previous lessons, you learned how to set up and use Neo4j MCP tools to explore databases and test queries. Now it's time to put everything together and see the real power of MCP tools in action.

One of the most exciting aspects of using MCP tools with AI agents is their ability to work collaboratively. The agent will select the correct tools in sequence, executing them one after another until the task is complete.

You can use this to your advantage by getting the agent to quickly build entire applications for you. This is sometimes called "vibe coding" - where you describe what you want, and the AI figures out how to build it.

Your goal is to **instruct Copilot to build a Python program** that allows a user to enter a movie genre and returns the top 5 movies in that genre.

== Setting up environment variables

Before you begin, you'll need to set up your environment variables for the Neo4j connection.

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with the following variables:

[source,text,subs="attributes+"]
..env
----
NEO4J_URI={instance-scheme}://{instance-ip}:{instance-boltPort}
NEO4J_USERNAME={instance-username}
NEO4J_PASSWORD={instance-password}
ifdef::instance-database[]
NEO4J_DATABASE={instance-database}
endif::[]
----


== The challenge

Ask Copilot to create this application using the following prompt:

[source,text]
----
include::includes/prompt.txt[]
----

Copilot will use the MCP tools to:

1. **Explore the database schema** to understand the data structure
2. **Write and test a Cypher query** to ensure it works correctly
3. **Generate the Python application** that uses the Neo4j Python driver
4. **Validate the solution** by running test queries

[TIP]
.The power of validation
====
Notice how the prompt instructs the agent to validate the Cypher statement on real data before creating the application. This is a key practice - the agent will use the `read-neo4j-cypher` tool to test queries first, ensuring the final application actually works.
====

== Testing your application

Once Copilot has built your application, test it by running the program and entering [copy]#Mystery# as the genre.

If everything works correctly, you should have everything you need to answer the question to complete the challenge.

[NOTE]
.Probabilistic outputs
====
The output is probabilistic, so the application structure may vary slightly between runs, but you should get consistent results from the database queries. That's the goal of any good data application - reliable, accurate results regardless of how the code is structured.
====

== Extra credit

Why not ask Copilot to write a unit test for the application?

== Summary

You've experienced the power of using MCP tools to rapidly prototype and build applications. The agent was able to:

* Understand the database schema
* Write and validate Cypher queries
* Generate a complete Python application
* Test the solution end-to-end

This demonstrates how MCP tools can accelerate development workflows, allowing you to focus on the "what" while the AI handles the "how".
