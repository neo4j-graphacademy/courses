Create a simple command line application in python that:

1. Connects to Neo4j using the Neo4j Python driver using environment variables: NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD.
2. Accepts a Genre name as a text input 
2. Runs a Cypher statement that produces a list of the top five movies ordered by their imdbRating in descending order.  

Rules: 

* The query must filer on non-null values 
* You must use tools to understand the schema information 
* You must validate your Cypher statement on real data from the database before you write it to the application.
