Use Copilot to ask about the database schema. You can ask a vague question to get a comprehensive overview of the schema:

Or you can ask a more targetted question to get information about a specific node type:

.Solution
====
The correct answer is **RATED**.

According to the movies database schema, User nodes are connected to Movie nodes through the RATED relationship. This means users can rate movies, and this rating relationship is stored as an outgoing relationship from the User node to the Movie node.

The other options (WATCHED, LIKED, REVIEWED, FOLLOWS) are not present in this particular database schema.
