= Tool Safety and Permissions

Why might the `read-neo4j-cypher` tool be considered safer to run without explicit approval compared to the `write-neo4j-cypher` tool?

Select the correct answer:

* [ ] The read tool has better error handling than the write tool
* [ ] The read tool only works with small datasets
* [x] The read tool executes within read transactions and cannot modify data
* [ ] The read tool requires authentication while the write tool does not
* [ ] The read tool is faster than the write tool

.Hint
====
Think about the fundamental difference between reading and writing data. Consider what protections are built into each tool at the transaction level.

The lesson mentions two specific benefits of the read tool:
1. It adheres to routing policy in Neo4j clusters
2. It provides a safety guarantee about data modification

Which of these relates to why it might be considered safer to auto-approve?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is **The read tool executes within read transactions and cannot modify data**.

The `read-neo4j-cypher` tool can be considered safer for auto-approval because it executes queries within read transactions. This provides a fundamental safety guarantee - read transactions cannot perform write operations like `CREATE`, `MERGE`, `SET` or `DELETE`. 

Even if an LLM generates a potentially destructive Cypher statement, the driver will block these operations from running in read mode.
