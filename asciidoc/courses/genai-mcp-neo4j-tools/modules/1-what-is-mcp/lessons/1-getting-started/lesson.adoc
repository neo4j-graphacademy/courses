= What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol, commonly referred to as MCP, is an open protocol that enables agents and AI applications to work together in a standardized way.

Before we dive into MCP, let's familiarise ourselves with the concept of an **Agent**.

== What are Agents?

There are many defintions of an Agent, but for the context of this course, an Agent is a system that **acts independently** to **achieve a specific goal**.

A common type of framework for building agents is the **ReAct** framework.
When a ReAct agent receives an input, it will use a Large Language Model (LLM) to **reason** on the problem at hand, and use the descriptions of tools to select the correct tool(s) to solve the problem, and **act** by calling the tools, either in sequence or in parallel, to perform actions.

The agent will continue to reason and act until the goal is achieved.

An example of a tool may be a function that searches the web, calls an external API or uploads a file to a cloud storage service.


== Where does MCP fit in?

While agents may have access to tools within the scope of their application, MCP provides a standardized way for the agent to consume tools from other providers and either hosted remotely or accessed locally through Standard Input/Output (stdio).


== Architecture

The MCP protocol consists of the following elements.

=== Servers

The protocol follows a client-server archicture, similar to microservices, where **Servers** provide capabilities through a list of **tools**.
Each tool that the server hosts has additional metadata assigned to it, including a unique identifier, a description of when that tool can be used, and a list of parameters that the tool can receive.

Along with tools, servers provide access to **Resources**, read-only data that can be consumed by the client.
Each resource has its own unique URI, similar to an endpoint in a REST API, and can be used to provide quick acess to a record in a database.

MCP tools can also provide **Prompt templates**, allowing the client to use pre-written prompts that follow best practices.


which are templates that can be used to generate a prompt for the tool.

=== Clients 

The second piece of the MCP architecture is the **Client**.
A client is responsible for managing a one-to-one connection to a server.

When a client starts, it will connect to a server, and request a list of tools, resources and prompt templates that the server provides access to.  

// It is the responsibility of the client to decide which tool to use, and provide the appropriate parameters to the tool.


=== Hosts 

One or more clients are managed by a **Host**, an application or piece of software that maintains session state and context.
It is the responsibility of the host to decide which tool to use, and provide the appropriate parameters to the tool.
The host then delegates the responsibility of executing the tool to the client.

An example of a host may be Claude Desktop, Amazon Q, VS Code or Cursor.


=== Tools 

Each tool will have a unique identifier, a description of when that tool can be used, and a list of parameters that the tool can receive. 

For example, a tool for searching the web may be defined as:

* **id**: search-web
* **description**: Search the web for information
* **parameters**: query, a string

// TODO: verify, add more info when other types become available.
Tools can output a result as text or return Base-64 encoded images.

== Lesson summary

In this lesson, you learned:

* **Agents** are systems that act independently to achieve specific goals, often using the ReAct framework (reasoning and acting with tools)
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** provides a standardized way for agents to consume tools from external providers
* **MCP Architecture** consists of four key components:
  - **Servers** provide capabilities through tools, resources, and prompt templates
  - **Clients** manage one-to-one connections to servers
  - **Hosts** (like Claude Desktop) manage clients and decide which tools to use
  - **Tools** have unique identifiers, descriptions, and parameters
* **Real-world usage** involves configuring hosts to connect to MCP servers for enhanced functionality
