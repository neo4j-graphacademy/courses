.Solution
====
The correct answer is **Standard IO (stdio)**.

When an MCP server is run using `npx` (or any command-line tool), the host communicates with the server through standard input/output streams. The host writes JSON-RPC messages to the server's stdin, and reads responses from the server's stdout. This is the most common transport method for locally installed MCP servers.
