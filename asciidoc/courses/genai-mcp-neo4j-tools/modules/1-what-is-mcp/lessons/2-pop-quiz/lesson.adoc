== Summary 

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) consists of several key elements:

* **Servers** - Provide capabilities through tools, resources, and prompt templates in a client-server architecture
* **Clients** - Manage one-to-one connections to servers and request available tools, resources, and prompt templates
* **Hosts** - Applications (like Claude Desktop, Amazon Q, or Cursor) that maintain session state, manage clients, and decide which tools to use

In the next lesson, you will learn how to install your first MCP server.
