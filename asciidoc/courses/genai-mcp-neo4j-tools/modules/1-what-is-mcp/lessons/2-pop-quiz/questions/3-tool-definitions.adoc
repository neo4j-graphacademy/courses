The correct answers are:

1. **A unique identifier** - Each tool must have a unique name to be referenced.
2. **A description of when to use the tool** - Helps users understand the tool's purpose.
3. **A list of parameters** - Defines what inputs the tool accepts.

Version numbers, license keys, and memory requirements are not standard requirements for MCP tools.
