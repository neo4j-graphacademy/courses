= Installing the Neo4j Cypher MCP server
:type: challenge
:order: 4

In the previous lesson, you learned how to configure an MCP server in Claude Desktop.

In this challenge, you will install the Neo4j Cypher MCP server to VS Code and configure it to connect to your Neo4j database.

include::../../../../../../shared/courses/codespace/get-started.adoc[]

The setup instructions in the README will be open automatically when you open the Codespace.

Your environment variables required for step 2 can be found further down this page.

[NOTE]
.GitHub Codespace
====
You can keep the Codespace open while completing the course.
You can open your existing codespaces at link:https://github.com/codespaces[github.com/codespaces^].
====

[%collapsible]
.Develop on your local machine
====
You will need:

* link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code^].
* link:https://python.org[Python] .
* The ability to install packages using `pip`

You may want to set up a virtual environment using link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[`venv`^] or link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[`virtualenv`^] to keep your dependencies separate from other projects.

Clone the link:{repository-link}[github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools] repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools
----

Install `uv` using `pip`:

[source,bash]
----
pip install uv
----

You do not need to create a Neo4j database as you will use the provided sandbox instance.

The sandbox uses Neo4j's GenAI functions, you can find out more about how to configure them in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/[Neo4j GenAI integration documentation^].

== Interacting with Neo4j

To interact with a Neo4j database, we can use the link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher[Neo4j Cypher MCP Server^].  This server is one of a number of link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j[MCP servers offered by Neo4j^].
When configured with environment variables that point to a Neo4j database, the server will enable the host to:

* Obtain the schema of the database
* Execute Cypher statements that _read_ and _write_ data to the database


The server is written in Python, so you will use the `uvx` command to install the server from PyPI and run the server locally, and configure VS Code to communicate with the server using the Standard Input/Output (stdio) transport method.


== Installing and Configuring the Neo4j Cypher MCP Server

To configure the Neo4j Cypher MCP server to connect to your Neo4j instance, copy the complete configuration below into the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your Codespace:

..vscode/mcp.json
[source,json, subs="attributes+"]
----
{
  "servers": {
    "neo4j-cypher": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-neo4j-cypher"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "{instance-scheme}://{instance-ip}:7687",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "{instance-username}",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "{instance-password}",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "{instance-database}"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

This definition instructs VS Code to use the `uvx` command to run the `mcp-neo4j-cypher`.  The `env` section configures the environment variables to connect to your database.

[TIP]
====
You can use the VS Code **MCP: Add Server** command to create the initial configuration, then add the environment variables manually.
====


== Verify your installation

To verify that the server is installed correctly, you can use the Command Palette to execute the ***MCP: List servers*** command.

image::images/mcp-list-servers.jpg[MCP: List servers,width=450,align=center]

You should see a server named `neo4j-cypher` in the list.

image::images/mcp-listed-servers.jpg[neo4j-cypher server listed in MCP server list,width=450,align=center]

Select the server and then **Start Server**.  VS Code will connect to the server and pull the description of the tools available.

If you ask Copilot which MCP tools are available, you should get a list containing three tools.
Open the Copilot chat window by executing the **Chat: Open Chat (Agent mode)** command in the Command Palette or accessing the three line menu, selecting **View** and then **Chat**.

====
Tools are only available when you use Chat in **Agent mode**.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated how to install an MCP server and configure it with environment variables.

.Installing Multiple Neo4j Connections
====
You can install the Neo4j Cypher MCP server multiple times within the same host using the `--namespace` option.

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "movies-neo4j": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [ "mcp-neo4j-cypher@0.2.3", "--namespace", "movies" ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "recommendations",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "recommendations",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "recommendations"
      }
    },
    "local-neo4j": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [ "mcp-neo4j-cypher@0.2.3" ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "password",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_NAMESPACE": "local"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

This configuration will install two Neo4j Cypher MCP servers, one with tools prefixed with `movies-` for the movies database and one prefixed with `local-` for the local database.

====

In the next module, you will explore and understand the full capabilities of the Neo4j Cypher MCP server and its available tools.
