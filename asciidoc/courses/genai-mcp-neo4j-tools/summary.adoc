= Developing with Neo4j MCP Tools

== Understanding MCP Fundamentals

You now know how to:

* Understand the Model Context Protocol and its role in AI integrations
* Set up MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor with Neo4j servers
* Configure MCP servers securely with proper authentication
* Navigate the MCP ecosystem and discover available tools

== Working with Neo4j MCP Servers

You've mastered working with the link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher[Neo4j Cypher MCP server^].  You can also try the following Neo4j MCP servers:

* **https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher[mcp-neo4j-cypher^]**: Direct database interactions and Cypher query execution
* **https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-memory[mcp-neo4j-memory^]**: Building persistent knowledge graphs from conversations
* **https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cloud-aura-api[mcp-neo4j-cloud-aura-api^]**: Cloud database management and infrastructure provisioning
* **https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-data-modeling[mcp-neo4j-data-modeling^]**: Interactive graph data modeling and visualization
// * GraphRAG implementations using Neo4j as the knowledge base

// == Building Custom MCP Tools

// You've learned essential skills for creating:

// * Custom MCP servers using FastMCP framework
// * GraphRAG-powered tools that connect AI models to graph databases
// * Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
// * Testing and debugging MCP implementations with MCP Inspector

== Pro Tips

=== Security Best Practices

* Always review MCP server code before deployment
* Implement proper user consent flows for data access
* Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
* Test all MCP tools in safe environments before production use

=== Development Optimization

* Leverage the MCP Python SDK for rapid development
* Use MCP Inspector for testing and debugging servers
* Implement proper error handling and logging
* Design servers with focused, single-purpose functionality

=== Production Deployment

* Use OAuth 2.0 for secure remote server authentication
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for enterprise environments
* Monitor MCP tool usage for auditing and security
* Consider MCP tool whitelisting in production systems
