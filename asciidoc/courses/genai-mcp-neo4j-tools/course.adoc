Model Context Protocol, referred to as MCP, is an open standard designed to connect AI applications with tools and data sources.

It enables AI agents to access and interact with external resources as part of their reasoning step, allowing them to perform more complex tasks and collaborate effectively.

In this course, you will learn:

* How MCP Servers define sets of tools that AI agents can discover and use.
* How MCP Clients establish connections to access and call tools to perform tasks.
* How Neo4j's suite of MCP tools can help aid your development on top of Neo4j.
* How to build your own link:/knowledge-graph-rag/[GraphRAG^] tool to retrieve information from a Neo4j database.

== Prerequisites 

This course assumes that you have are familiar with the basics of Generative AI and Large Language Models.  If you are not, we recommend that you link:/courses/genai-fundamentals/[take the GenAI Fundamentals course^] first.

This course also uses `uv`, a Python package manager, and its `uvx` command to run MCP servers.  If you are not familiar with uv, you should also link:https://docs.astral.sh/uv/[review the uv documentation].

The course features hands-on challenges using link:https://github.com/settings/copilot[GitHub CoPilot^], you will need to enable either the free or Pro version.
