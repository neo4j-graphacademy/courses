Model Context Protocol, referred to as MCP, is an open standard designed to connect AI applications with tools and data sources.

It enables AI agents to access and interact with external resources as part of their reasoning step, allowing them to perform more complex tasks and collaborate effectively.

In this course, you will learn:

* How MCP Servers define sets of tools that AI agents can discover and use.
* How MCP Clients establish connections to access and call tools to perform tasks.
* How Neo4j's suite of MCP tools can help aid your development on top of Neo4j.
* How to build your own link:/knowledge-graph-rag/[GraphRAG^] tool to retrieve information from a Neo4j database.

The course features hands-on challenges using GitHub Codespaces, which are free to use for 60 hours a month.
