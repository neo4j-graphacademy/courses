Learn how to use the Model Context Protocol to create intelligent AI applications

[Learn more about this course](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools)

## Concepts

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - An open standard designed to connect AI applications with tools and data sources, enabling AI agents to access and interact with external resources
* **MCP Server** - Provides capabilities through tools, resources, and prompt templates that clients can discover and use
* **MCP Client** - Manages one-to-one connections to servers and executes tools on behalf of the host
* **MCP Host** - An application (like Claude Desktop, VS Code, or custom agents) that manages clients and determines which tools to use
* **MCP Tools** - Discrete functions with unique identifiers, descriptions, and parameters that can be invoked by AI agents
* **Agent** - A system that acts independently using tool calling to access information and take actions to achieve specific goals
* **Neo4j Cypher MCP Server** - A specialized MCP server that provides AI agents with the ability to read and write data to Neo4j databases
* **Schema Discovery** - The process of understanding database structure before generating queries to prevent AI hallucinations
* **stdio Transport** - Communication method where client starts server locally and communicates through standard input/output streams

### ReAct Framework

A continuous loop of planning, reasoning, and acting that agents use to achieve specific goals:

1. **Planning** - Analyze the task and break it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks
2. **Reasoning** - Select the most appropriate tools and actions for each sub-task based on available capabilities
3. **Acting** - Execute the selected tools and gather results from the actions taken
4. **Evaluation** - Check if the goal has been achieved or if further iterations are needed
5. **Feedback** - Use results to refine the approach and inform the next iteration of the loop

### MCP Server Features

MCP servers provide three main types of capabilities:

* **Tools** - Discrete functions that can be invoked by AI agents to perform specific actions (e.g., database queries, API calls, file operations)
* **Resources** - Static or dynamic content that can be read by clients (e.g., files, documents, configuration data)
* **Prompts** - Pre-defined prompt templates that can be used to guide AI interactions and provide consistent context

## Installation and Configuration

### VS Code MCP Configuration

```json
// .vscode/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neo4j-cypher": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-neo4j-cypher@0.2.3",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "<your-password>",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "neo4j"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Neo4j MCP Tools

### get-neo4j-schema Tool

**Purpose**: Discovers the database schema including node labels, properties, and relationships.

**Input**: Natural language requests about the database structure:
- "Describe the data model"
- "What node labels and relationship types are available in the database?"
- "How are User and Movie nodes related?"

**Output**:
```json
[
  {
    "label": "Movie",
    "attributes": {
      "budget": "INTEGER",
      "movieId": "STRING unique indexed",
      "imdbRating": "FLOAT indexed",
      "title": "STRING indexed",
      "year": "INTEGER indexed",
      "revenue": "INTEGER"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "IN_GENRE": "Genre"
    }
  },
  {
    "label": "User",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "STRING indexed",
      "userId": "STRING unique indexed"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "RATED": "Movie"
    }
  }
]
```

### read-neo4j-cypher Tool

**Purpose**: Executes safe read-only Cypher queries that don't modify data.

// Example query for top movies by revenue:
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.revenue IS NOT NULL
RETURN m.title AS title, m.revenue AS revenue
ORDER BY m.revenue DESC
LIMIT 10

**Output**:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Avatar",
    "revenue": 2847246203
  },
  {
    "title": "Avengers: Endgame", 
    "revenue": 2797501328
  },
  {
    "title": "Titanic",
    "revenue": 2257844554
  }
]
```

### write-neo4j-cypher Tool

**Purpose**: Executes write operations that modify database data (requires user approval).

**Input**: Natural language requests for data modification:
- "Create a new user named Sarah"
- "Add a 5-star rating from John to The Godfather"
- "Update the movie budget for Titanic to 200000000"

**Output**:
```json
[
  {
    "u": {
      "identity": 1234,
      "labels": ["User"],
      "properties": {
        "name": "Sarah",
        "userId": "sarah123"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Building Applications with MCP

* Use VSCode, Cursor, etc. to build an application with MCP tools.
* The `mcp-neo4j-cypher` tool can inspect the database, generate Cypher queries and run them.
* Agents can use MCP tools to generate a Cypher statement and validate it using real data before using it in an application.

## MCP Architecture Patterns

### Client-Server Communication

* MCP follows client-server architecture
* Server provides tools, client executes them

### Transport Methods

#### stdio -

Standard input/output - for local server communication

Example stdio configuration:

```json
{
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["mcp-neo4j-cypher@0.2.3", "--transport", "stdio"]
}
```

#### HTTP

Remote server via Server-Sent Events (SSE) or Streaming HTTP.


### Example tool definition structure
```json
{
  "id": "write-neo4j-cypher",
  "description": "Write data to the Neo4j database",
  "parameters": {
    "cypher": {"type": "string", "description": "The Cypher statement to execute"},
    "params": {"type": "dict", "description": "The parameters to replace in the code"}
  }  # No parameters required
}
```

### ReAct Agent Framework

```python
# ReAct loop implementation concept:
def react_agent_loop(user_input, available_tools):
    """
    Continuous loop of planning, reasoning, and acting
    """
    goal_achieved = False

    while not goal_achieved:
        # PLANNING: Analyze task and break into sub-tasks
        plan = analyze_task(user_input)

        # REASONING: Select appropriate tools for each sub-task
        selected_tools = select_tools(plan, available_tools)

        # ACTING: Execute tools and gather results
        results = execute_tools(selected_tools)

        # EVALUATION: Check if goal is achieved
        goal_achieved = evaluate_progress(results, user_input)

        # FEEDBACK: Use results to refine next iteration
        user_input = incorporate_feedback(results, user_input)

    return results
```
