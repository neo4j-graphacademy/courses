= The Driver 
:order: 1

In this module, you'll learn the fundamentals of working with Neo4j in Go applications. You will start by learning how to install the Neo4j Go Driver and use it to connect to a Neo4j database instance. 

You'll then write your first query using the driver's `ExecuteQuery()` method and learn how to process the results returned from the database.

By the end of this module, you'll have the foundation needed to start building Go applications with Neo4j.
