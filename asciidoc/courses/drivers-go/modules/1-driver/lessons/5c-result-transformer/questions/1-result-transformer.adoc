[source,go,role=nocopy noplay]
----
result, err := driver.ExecuteQuery(ctx,
    "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name AS name",
    nil,
    neo4j./*select:EagerResultTransformer*/,
)
----

- [ ] LazyResultTransformer
- [x] EagerResultTransformer
- [ ] StreamResultTransformer
- [ ] AllResultTransformer

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is `EagerResultTransformer`.

[source,go,role=nocopy noplay]
----
result, err := driver.ExecuteQuery(ctx,
    "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name AS name",
    nil,
    neo4j.EagerResultTransformer,
)
----

`EagerResultTransformer` loads all results into memory at once, which is useful for smaller result sets or when you need to access all results immediately.
