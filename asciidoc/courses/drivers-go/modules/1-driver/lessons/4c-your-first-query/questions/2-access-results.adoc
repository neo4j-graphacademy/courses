[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is `Get("born")`.

[source,go,role=nocopy noplay]
----
for _, record := range result.Records {
    born, _ := record.Get("born")
    fmt.Println(born)
}
----

The `Get()` method retrieves a value by key from a record and returns both the value and a boolean indicating if the key exists.
