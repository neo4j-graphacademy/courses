[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is `Type`. This property returns the type of the relationship as a string.

[source,go,role=nocopy noplay]
----
relationship, _ := record.Get("acted_in")
relObj := relationship.(neo4j.Relationship)
relType := relObj.Type  // returns: "ACTED_IN"
----

The `Type` property is the standard way to access the relationship type in Neo4j's Go driver.
