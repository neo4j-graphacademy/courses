== Course Description

In this course, you will learn how to interact with Neo4j in your Go project using the Neo4j Go Driver.

We will follow the steps to create an instance of the Neo4j Go Driver, learn how to open sessions and execute read and write transactions against a Neo4j Sandbox instance.

Enrolling on this coulrse will automatically creates a new `recommendations` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.



=== Prerequisites

By taking this course, we assume that you have a working knowledge of Go, dependency management with link:https://pkg.go.dev/[pkg.go.dev^] and wider Go ecosystem.
We also assume that you have at least a basic knowledge of Neo4j.

If you haven't already done so, we recommend that you also take the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals] course in order to gain a basic understanding of Neo4j and the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals] to understand how to query Neo4j using Cypher.
