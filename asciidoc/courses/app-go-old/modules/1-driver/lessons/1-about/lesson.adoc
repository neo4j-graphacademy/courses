= About the Driver
:type: quiz

In the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] course, we cover how to query Neo4j using a language called Cypher.
To execute a Cypher statement against a Neo4j database you will use an object called a *Driver*.


// tag::driver[]
> The **Driver** object is a thread-safe, application-wide fixture from which all Neo4j interaction derives.
>
> The Driver API is **topology independent**, so you can run the same code against a *Neo4j cluster* or a *single DBMS*.

// end::driver[]

To connect to and query Neo4j from within a Go application, you use the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/go[Neo4j Go Driver^].

The Neo4j Go Driver is one of five officially supported drivers, the others are Java, JavaScript, .NET, and Python.
There are also a wide range of Community Drivers available for other languages including PHP and Ruby.

You should create a **single instance** of the Driver in your application per Neo4j cluster or DBMS, which can then be shared across your application.

== Installing the Driver

The Neo4j Go Driver can be installed using the `go get` command.

[source,shell]
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v4

If you need to pin a specific link:https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/tags[4.x version^], you can run this instead:

[source,shell]
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v4@<4.x tag>


== Creating a Driver Instance

Each driver instance will connect to one DBMS, or Neo4j cluster, depending on the value provided in the connection string.

The driver dependency contains a `NewDriver()` function for creating a new driver instance.

The `NewDriver()` function requires one mandatory parameter, a **connection string** for the Neo4j cluster or DBMS - for example `neo4j://localhost:7687` or `neo4j+s://_dbhash_.databases.neo4j.io:7687`.

Additionally, you will also pass a parameter to represent the Neo4j user credentials.
You can provide basic username/password authentication by passing the username and password as well as a scheme.

Here is an example for how to create a driver instance:

.Creating a Driver Instance
[source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/example/main.go[tag=import]

// ...

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/example/main.go[tag=driver,indent=0]
----

The above example creates an _encrypted_ connection to the Neo4j server at `dbhash.databases.neo4j.io` on the default port number of `7687`.
The driver then attempts to authenticate against the server using a basic authentication with the username `neo4j`,  password `letmein` and an empty scheme.


=== Verifying Connectivity

You can verify that the connection details used during driver instantiation are correct by calling the `VerifyConnectivity()` method.
This function will raise a `Neo4jException` with a `code` property of `Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized` if a connection could not be made.

.Verify Connectivity
[source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the Neo4j Go Driver and how it can be used to connect to Neo4j from within a Go application.

In the next lesson, we will take a closer look at the first argument in the `neo4j.NewDriver()` function, the connection string.
