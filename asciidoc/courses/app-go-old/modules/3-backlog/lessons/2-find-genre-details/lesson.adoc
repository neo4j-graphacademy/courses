When the user clicks a genre in the list, they are taken to a list of movies for that genre.  This list is populated by an API request to `/api/genres/[name]`, for example http://localhost:3000/api/genres/Comedy.

The `FindOneByName()` method the the `GenreService` accepts one argument, the name of the genre, and should return the information about the genre, along with a count of movies and a poster image.

[IMPORTANT]
.What does this query do?
====
This query uses the `MATCH` clause for a `Genre` node with the name passed through with the function call as a parameter.
The query then finds the highest rated movie with a `poster` property and uses that image as the background to the card in the UI.

The `size()` function uses a precalculated value stored against the `Genre` node to return the number of incoming `IN_GENRE` relationships  the `Genre` node.

== Your Task

* Modify the `FindOneByName()` method on the `GenreService` to call the Neo4j database and return details for a genre.
* The `name` variable should be passed to the `run()` call as a parameter.
* If no records are found, an error should be returned.

In this Challenge, you modified the `FindOneByName()` method in the `GenreService` to retrieve genre information from Neo4j.

In the next Challenge, you will update multiple methods in the `MovieService` that return a paginated list of movies.
