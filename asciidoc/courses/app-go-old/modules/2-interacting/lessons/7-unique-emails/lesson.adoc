= Unique Email Addresses

In the link:../5-registering[Registering a User challenge^], you updated the `Save()` method in the link:{repository-blob}/main/pkg/services/auth.go[`AuthService`^] to create a new User node in the database.

There is still one `// TODO` comment remaining in this file.

Currently, it is still possible to use the same email address twice, we should take advantage of Unique Constraints in the database to guard against that.

This functionality could be handled by checking the database before running the `CREATE` Cypher statement, but this could still cause problems if the database is manually updated elsewhere.

Instead, you can pass the responsibility of handling the duplicate user error to the database by creating a Unique Constraint on the `:User` label, asserting that the `email` property must be unique.

This will create a potential error case that will need to be handled in the code.

To pass this challenge, you will need to:

1. <<Create a Unique Constraint>>
2. <<Handle the Resulting Error>>


== Handling Constraint Errors

If we take a look at `Save()` method, it is currently missing any error handling following the `tx.Run()` call.

.pkg/services/auth.go
[source,go,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{previous-branch}/pkg/services/auth.go[tag=register]
----

Furthermore, any errors will be sent back up the stack and will result in a `500 Bad Request` error.

Instead, in the case of a Constraint Error, a `DomainError` should be returned with an appropriate error message.
This way, the error can be better handled by the UI.

To do this, you will need to attempt to cast the `err` returned by the call to `tx.Run()` as a `neo4j.Neo4jError`.  If the error can be cast, you'll need to call the `Title()` method to check which type of error has been thrown.

.Error Handling Example
[source,go,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/pkg/challenges/error_test.go[tag="constrainterror"]
----

When a user _tries_ to register with an email address that has already been taken, the database will throw an `Neo.ClientError.Schema.ConstraintViolation` error.
Instead of this being treated as an internal server error, it should instead be treated as a `422 Unprocessable Entity`.
This will allow the front end to handle the error appropriately.

A `DomainError` struct exists in link:{repository-blob}/main/pkg/services/errors.go[`pkg/services/errors.go`^] which, when returned, will be marshalled into an appropriate error by the `serializeJson` function in link:{repository-blob}/main/pkg/routes/http.go[`pkg/routes/http.go`^]


== Completing the Challenge

To complete this challenge, you will first create a new constraint in your Sandbox database and modify the code to check the error returned by `tx.Run()` and in the case of a `ConstraintValidationFailed` error, return an instance of `DomainError` with an appropriate message.


=== Create a Unique Constraint

In order to ensure that a property and label combination is unique, you run a `CREATE CONSTRAINT` query.
In this case, we need to ensure that the `email` property is unique across all nodes with a `:User` label.

Click the **Run in Sandbox** button to create the constraint on your Sandbox.

.pkg/services/auth.go
[source,cypher]
----
include::{cypher-repository-raw}/main/cypher/2-interacting/6-unique-emails/constraint.cypher[]
----


=== Handle the Resulting Error

Now, when a user attempts to register with an email address that already exists in the database, a `Neo.ClientError.Schema.ConstraintValidationFailed` error will be thrown.

In the application, first cast the error as a `neo4j.Neo4jError`, this will allow you to check the individual parts of the error code.
If the `Title()` function equals `ConstraintValidationFailed`, return a modified error informing the user that an account already exists with the supplied email address.

// TODO: How will this translate to a 422 in the route handler?



Your code should look like this:

.pkg/services/auth.go

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/services/auth.go[tag="catch"]
----

After modifying the `Save()` method, scroll to <<Testing>> to verify that the code works as expected.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you have modified the `Save()` method to catch specific errors thrown by the database.

If you wanted to go further, you could use a Regular Expression to extract more specific information about the `ConstraintValidationFailed` error.

Now that a user is able to successfully register, in the next Challenge, you will update the `FindOneByEmailAndPassword()` method to find our user in the database.
