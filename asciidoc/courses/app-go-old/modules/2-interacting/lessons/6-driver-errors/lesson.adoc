= Handling Driver Errors

When executing a Cypher statement, certain exceptions and error cases may arise.
One error could be a _transient_ error that may be resolved if retried, for example a problem connecting to the database instance.
Another type of error could be something more permanent, for example a Syntax Error or a Constraint Error.

When calling `Run()`, the method will return two values, a result and an error.

By casting the resulting error to the type `neo4j.Neo4jError`, you are able to access properties which will allow you to further diagnose the error.

.Handling an Error

1. The `.Code` property provides a unique <<Error Code>>
2. The `.Msg` property provides more information on the error

Helper functions are also provided to retrieve the classification, category and title of the error code.

== Error Code

Each status code follows the same format, and includes four parts:

[source,role=nocopy]
----
Neo.[Classification].[Category].[Title]
(1)        (2)          (3)       (4)
----

1. Every Neo4j Error code is prefixed with `Neo`.
2. The Classification provides a high-level classification of the error - for example, a client-side error or an error with the database.
3. The Category provides a higher-level category for the error - for example, a problem with clustering, a procedure or the database schema.
4. The Title provides specific information about the error that has occurred.


== Common Exception Types

Depending on the nature of the error, you may receive one of the following exceptions:

* `neo4j.exceptions.Neo4jError` - Raised when the Cypher engine returns an error to the client.
* `neo4j.exceptions.ClientError` - The Client sent a bad request - changing the request might yield a successful outcome.
** `neo4j.exceptions.CypherSyntaxError` - Raised when the Cypher statement contains one or more syntax errors
** `neo4j.exceptions.CypherTypeError` - Raised when or more of the data types in the query is incorrect
** `neo4j.exceptions.ConstraintError` - Raised when action is rejected due to a constraint violation
** `neo4j.exceptions.AuthError` - Raised when authentication failure occurs.
** `neo4j.exceptions.Forbidden` - Raised when the action is forbidden for the authenticated user
* `neo4j.exceptions.TransientError` - The database cannot service the request right now, retrying later might yield a successful outcome

** `neo4j.exceptions.ForbiddenOnReadOnlyDatabase` - The write cypher you are requesting cannot be run on a readonly database
** `neo4j.exceptions.NotALeader` - The write query cannot be executed on the current server because it is not the leader of the cluster

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned how to interpret the errors thrown by the Neo4j Go Driver.

In the next Challenge, you will add a unique constraint to the database and handle constraint violation errors when a user attempts to register with an email address that already exists in the database.
