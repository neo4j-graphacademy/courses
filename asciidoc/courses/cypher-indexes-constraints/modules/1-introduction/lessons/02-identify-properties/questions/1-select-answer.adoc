= 1. What are the uniqueness constraints?

Refer to the data model shown at the beginning of this lesson.

Before we load the data into the graph, we need to add constraints for some node labels in the graph per our data model:

. The person data has a unique value for the tmdbId field.
. The movie data has a unique value for the movieId field.
. The user data has a field to uniquely identify itself. There may be reviewers with the same name.
. The genre data has a field to uniquely identify itself.

What properties do we define uniqueness constraints for? (select all that apply)

* [x] Person.tmdbId
* [x] Movie.movieId
* [ ] Actor.name
* [ ] Director.name
* [x] User.userId
* [ ] Genre.genreId
* [x] Genre.name

.Hint
====
You do not define uniqueness constraints for the Actor and Director labels as these nodes are created as Person nodes and a node only needs one unique identifier.

This data model requires four constraints.
