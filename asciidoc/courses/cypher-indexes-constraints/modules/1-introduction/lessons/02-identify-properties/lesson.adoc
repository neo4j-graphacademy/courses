== Data model for this course

This course uses the link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations[movie recommendations dataset^] as a starting point for your learning.

This is the same dataset that is used in the link:/courses/developer/[application development courses^] in GraphAcademy.

Here is the graph data model:

The node labels for the graph include:

* Person
* Actor
* Director
* Movie
* Genre
* User

The relationships for the graph include:

* ACTED_IN (with an  optional role property)
* DIRECTED (with an optional role property)
* RATED (with rating  and timestamp properties)
* IN_GENRE

Also notice that the nodes have a number of properties, along with the type of data that will be used for each property.

=== Step 1: Identify constraints

You use constraints to:

* Uniquely identify a node.
* Ensure a property exists for a node or relationship.
* Ensure a set of properties is unique and exists for a node (Node key).

==== Uniqueness constraints

You analyze the data requirements for the application and determine how each node will be uniquely identified.
In our Movie graph, we will define uniqueness constraints for these node labels:

* Movie nodes use  `movieId`.
* Person nodes use `tmdbId`.
* User nodes use `userId`.
* Genre nodes use `name`.

==== Existence constraints

Depending on how data is loaded or updated in the graph, you may want to further constrain that specific properties must exist
for nodes or relationships. These constraints are separate from the uniqueness constraints.

For example, you may want to enforce that every `role` property of the `ACTED_IN` relationship must have a value. Or that a `Person` node must have a value for the `name` property.

==== Node key constraints

In addition, there may be a combination of property values for a node that you want to ensure exist **and** are unique for every node with that label.

For example, there cannot be two Movie nodes in the graph that have the same title and year.

=== Step 2: Create constraints

Next you create the constraints per your analysis.

=== Step 3: Load the data

You typically load the data for your application and ensure that all data loaded correctly adhering to the constraints defined.
If a constraint is violated, the Cypher load will fail.

A best practice is to always use `MERGE` for creating nodes and relationships. `MERGE` first does a lookup (using the uniqueness constraint which is an index), then creates the node if it does not exist.

You can use `LOAD CSV` to load data or you can use the Neo4j Data Importer App. The Neo4j Data Importer App actually creates the uniqueness constraints for you.

=== Step 4: Identify indexes

Identifying the indexes for your graph depends on the most important use cases (queries) of your application.

For example, if this is an important query in your application:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
// Find all movies for this actor
// aName is a parameter with a string value for an actor
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WHERE p.name = $aName
RETURN m.title
----

The anchor of the query is the Person node with a specific name value.
This query can benefit from a RANGE index on the name property.

But if your important query is the following:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
// Find all actors for a movie with this in the title
// titleSubString is a portion of the title as a string
MATCH (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title CONTAINS $titleSubString
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

The anchor of the query is the title property of Movie nodes.
The test is `CONTAINS`. A RANGE index will help this query, but a TEXT index will perform better.

Through the remainder of this course, you will have an opportunity to create and use constraints and indexes.

=== Step 5: Create indexes

After you have loaded the data and identified the indexes you will need, you create the indexes.

As you test your application, an important part is testing the performance of the queries.
Use cases for the application may change so the identifying and creating indexes to improve query performance will be an ongoing process during the lifecycle of your application.
