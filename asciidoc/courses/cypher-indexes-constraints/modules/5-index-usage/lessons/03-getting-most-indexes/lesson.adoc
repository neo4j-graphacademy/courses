== Default implementations for an index

As you can see when you execute `SHOW INDEXES`, the implementation of the index is shown.

The default Neo4j implementations for indexes are:

[cols="50,50", options="header"]
|====
|*Index type*
|*Default implementation*
| Uniqueness constraint
| native-btree-1.0
| Node key
| native-btree-1.0
| b-tree
| native-btree-1.0
| Composite index
| native-btree-1.0
| TEXT index
| text-1.0
| Full-text
| fulltext-1.0
|====

Neo4j has its own implementation of native-btree-1.0 and text-1.0.
The fulltext-1.0 implementation uses lucene+native-3.0 (Apache Lucene).

With each release of Neo4j, there may be a new default implementation for an index so you should be aware of any migration of indexes that may be done between releases.

== Customizing full-text indexes (Java)

Perhaps due to your application environment requirements or due to the type of data in your graph, you may choose to use a different implementation for your indexes that performs better using your use cases.

You can change the implementation used for full-text indexes as described https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/full-text-analyzer-provider/[here^] for Java applications.

== Understanding limitations of indexes

Here is a helpful https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/index-limitations-and-workaround/[Knowledge-base article^] about the limitations of indexes in Neo4j.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned that you must fully understand the use and limitations of indexes for  your application.
This completes this course in Constraints and Indexes in Neo4j.
