= 2. How many indexes?

Suppose we have TEXT indexes on Scientist(name), Science(name), and Pioneer(name)

For this query:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (s:Scientist)-[:RESEARCHED]->(sc:Science)<-[:INVENTED_BY]-(p:Pioneer)
WHERE s.name CONTAINS 'William'
AND sc.name CONTAINS 'Neuro'
AND p.name CONTAINS 'John'
RETURN s.name, sc.name, p.name
----

How many indexes are used?

* [ ] 0
* [x] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
