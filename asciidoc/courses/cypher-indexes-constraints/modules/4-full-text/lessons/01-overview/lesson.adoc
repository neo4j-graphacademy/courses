== Full-text indexes

Full-text indexes are useful in applications that must parse property values for evaluating whether the property satisfies the criteria.
Full-text indexes rely on Apache Lucene for their implementation which makes their parsing capabilities very powerful.

With a full-text index, you can use Lucene's full-text query language to express how the values will be matched in a query.
A full-text index can be defined for multiple labels and/or properties, or for multiple relationship types and/or properties.

Unlike b-tree and TEXT indexes, you must call a procedure to use a full-text index at runtime.
That is, the query planner will not automatically use a full-text index unless you specify it in your Cypher code.

== Why use a full-text index?

Suppose you want to find all Movies that have certain phrases in their plots.
Performing this type of retrieval using b-tree or TEXT indexes could be very  expensive. For example:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.plot CONTAINS "murder"
AND m.plot CONTAINS "drugs"
RETURN m.title,m.plot
----

The default behavior in Neo4j is to use only one index for a query.
A subquery can use an additional index.
But for this query, the query engine needs to determine which predicate will be more efficient.
The first predicate  returns all "murder" rows. The second predicate returns all "drugs" rows.
For our dataset, the graph engine uses the index to select all properties that contain "drugs".
It can do so because it can determine using the data in the index, that the number of the rows that contain "drugs" is smaller than the number of rows that contain "murder".
For those rows, the query engine, then tests the properties for "murder".
That is, the index can only be used once for this query.

When using a full-text index, you can specify an expression that will find all properties that contain both strings, anywhere in them.
For example, if we had a full-text index on the Movie plot property named Movie_plot_ft, we could return the nodes that have both "murder" and "drugs" in them with this code:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes
('Movie_plot_ft', 'murder AND drugs')
YIELD node
----

This query uses Lucene's full-text query language to retrieve the nodes.

Another benefit of creating a full-text index is that you can specify an index on multiple properties associated with multiple labels.
