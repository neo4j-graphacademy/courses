= Using a full-text Index on a Relationship Property
:type: challenge
:order: 3
:sandbox: true

== Step 1: Create the full-text index

Suppose we want to enable some Lucene-type queries against the role properties of the ACTED_IN relationships in our graph.

Create a full-text index on the ACTED_IN relationship using the role property.
Name this index [copy]#ACTED_IN_role_ft#.

== Step 2: Query the graph with the full-text index

After having added this full-text index, write a query to return the role properties of all ACTED_IN relationships that contain **narrator** and **voice**.

This query should return 67 rows.

== Summary

In this Challenge, you demonstrated that you can create and use a full-text index for a relationship property.
In the next module, you will learn more about using indexes in Neo4j.
