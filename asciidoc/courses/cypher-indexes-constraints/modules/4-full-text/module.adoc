= Using Full-text Indexes in Neo4j
:sandbox: false
:order: 4

//[.transcript]
== Module overview

A full-text  index is based upon string values only, but  provides additional search capabilities that you do not get from RANGE or TEXT indexes that you have just learned about.
A full-text schema index can be used for:

* Node or relationship properties.
* Single property or multiple properties.
* Single or multiple types of nodes (labels).
* Single or multiple types of relationships.

One difference with full-text indexes in Neo4j is that you must explicitly specify their use whereas regular indexes are automatically used.

In this module, you will:

* Learn about using full-text indexes in Neo4j and why you would use them.
* Create a full-text index.
* Use a full-text index.
