= Using Indexes in Neo4j
:sandbox: false
:order: 3

//[.transcript]
== Module overview

Indexes are used to provide faster Cypher queries.
You have already learned that uniqueness constraints enable you to quickly look up a node.
This is because a uniqueness constraint is implemented as  an index.
You can also use indexes to make queries faster, even when multiple nodes or relationships have the same property value.

In this module, you will:

* Learn about the types indexes available in Neo4j and why you would use them.
* Create an index on a node property.
* Create an index on a relationship property.
* Create a composite index on a set of node properties.
* Create a TEXT index.
* Create a POINT index.
* Manage indexes in the graph.
