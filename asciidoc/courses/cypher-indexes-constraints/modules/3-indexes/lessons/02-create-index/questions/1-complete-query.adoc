= 1. Creating a RANGE index

Suppose we have a graph that contains Company nodes. One of the properties of a Company node is name.
We want to be able to optimize queries that test the names of companies.
What is the correct statement to create this RANGE index?

* [ ] `CREATE b-tree Company_name IF NOT EXISTS ON (Company.name)`
* [ ] `CREATE b-tree Company_name IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Company) ON (x.name)`
* [x] `CREATE INDEX Company_name IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Company) ON (x.name)`
* [ ] `CREATE INDEX Company_name IF NOT EXISTS ON (Company.name)`
