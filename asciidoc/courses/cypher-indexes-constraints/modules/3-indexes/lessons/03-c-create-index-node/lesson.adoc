= Creating a b-tree Index on a Node Property
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

== Performance improvement needed

In our Movie data model, we have identified this query as important and one that we need to make as fast as possible for our users.
Here is an example where we are testing the string "Austin" in all names of Person nodes.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS "Austin"
RETURN p.name
----

**Step 1:**

Profile this query and note if an index is used. Also note the number of db hits.
It uses an index, BTREE INDEX p:Person(name, url), the Node key constraint that you created earlier.
We no longer want this constraint, but rather want to focus on just the name.

**Step 2:**

Drop the Person_name_url_nodekey constraint.

**Step 3:**

Repeat the query with the profile. It should show more db hits.

**Step 4:**

Create a b-tree index for the name property of Person nodes.


* *`constraint_name`*: [copy]#Person_name#
* *`node_label`*: [copy]#Person#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#name#

**Step 5:**

Repeat the query with a profile.
Was your newly-created b-tree index used?
Are the number of db hits reduced?

== Summary

In this Challenge, you demonstrated that you can create a b-tree single property index in the graph to improve the performance of a query.
In the next Challenge, you will create a single property b-tree index on a relationship property.
