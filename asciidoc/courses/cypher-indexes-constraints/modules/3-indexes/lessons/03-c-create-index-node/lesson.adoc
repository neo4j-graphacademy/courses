= Creating a RANGE Index on a Node Property
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

== Performance improvement needed

In our Movie data model, we have identified this query as important and one that we need to make as fast as possible for our users.
Here is an example where we are testing the string "Austin" in all names of Person nodes.

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS "Austin"
RETURN p.name
----

**Step 1:**

Profile this query and note if an index is used. Also note the number of total db hits.
It uses an index, RANGE index p:Person(name, url), the Node key constraint that you created earlier.
We no longer want this constraint, but rather want to focus on just the name.

**Step 2:**

Drop the Person_name_url_nodekey constraint.

**Step 3:**

Repeat the query with the profile. It should show more total db hits.

**Step 4:**

Create a RANGE index for the name property of Person nodes.


* *`index_name`*: [copy]#Person_name#
* *`node_label`*: [copy]#Person#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#name#

**Step 5:**

Repeat the query with a profile.
Was your newly-created RANGE index used?
Is the elapsed time reduced?

== Summary

In this Challenge, you demonstrated that you can create a RANGE single property index in the graph to improve the performance of a query.
In the next Challenge, you will create a single property RANGE index on a relationship property.
