== TEXT Indexes in Neo4j

A TEXT index is designed for single properties of nodes or relationships that are strings.

A TEXT index can be used for:

* Equality checks `=`
* String comparisons  `ENDS WITH`, `CONTAINS`
* List membership x.prop IN ["a","b","c"]

[NOTE]
--
TEXT indexes cannot be used for existence checks like RANGE indexes can.

In addition, you should only create a TEXT index if you want to optimize `ENDS WITH` or `CONTAINS` tests which are faster with TEXT indexes.
In all other cases, you should use a RANGE index.

=== Syntax for creating a TEXT index for node property

Here is the syntax for creating a TEXT index for a single property of a node:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE TEXT INDEX <index_name> IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (x:<node_label>)
ON x.<property_key>
----

You specify the name of the index, the node label it will be associated with, and the name of the property.

* If an index already exists in the graph with the same name, no index is created.
* If an index does not exist in the graph with the same name:
** No index is created if there already is a TEXT index for that node label and property key.
** Otherwise, the TEXT index is created.

=== RANGE vs. TEXT for `CONTAINS` or `ENDS WITH` predicates

In some cases, TEXT indexes will outperform RANGE indexes.
Here is a query to find all Person nodes with a name that contains "Robert".

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS 'Robert'
RETURN p.name
----

Your graph should already have a RANGE index on the name property of Person nodes.

If you run this query, you will see it uses the RANGE index.
Rerun this query to get the true execution time. The first run of the query includes parsing the query and creating the execution plan.
The second run of the query will always yield shorter execution times which is what you should always do to measure query performance.

Now, let's create a TEXT index for this property. Execute this code:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE TEXT INDEX Person_name_text IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (x:Person)
ON (x.name)
----

You can list the indexes to see that there are now two indexes on this Person node property:

* Person_name  (RANGE)
* Person_name_text (TEXT)

Repeat the above query for the Person nodes that contain the string "Robert".
Notice that it uses the TEXT index.

You should execute this query twice to get its true performance statistics.
The TEXT index performs better than the RANGE index.
In the next Challenge, you will create duplicate data in the graph so you can see the benefit of a TEXT index.
It is important to ensure that whatever indexes you create for your graph will truly benefit the queries.

[NOTE]
.Execution time vs DB Hits
--
In many queries, the elapsed ms times are the same for two queries so we use the lower total db hits as a way of choosing which query is better.
Total db hits are generally a good measure to compare queries, but with an index such as a TEXT index, the db hits measurement may not be adequate for testing the query performance.
TEXT index usage may yield higher total db hits, but lower elapsed times.

=== TEXT index for list inclusion

Suppose we had created a TEXT index on the Person.bornIn property.
Execute this code:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE TEXT INDEX Person_bornIn_text IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (x:Person)
ON (x.bornIn)
----

This query would use the index:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE match (p:Person)
WHERE p.bornIn IN ["France", "Los Angeles, California, USA","Berlin, Germany" ]
RETURN p.name, p.bornIn
----

=== Why use a TEXT index?

Here are some reasons why you may choose a TEXT index over a RANGE index:

* TEXT indexes perform better than RANGE indexes if there are many duplicate properties.
* TEXT indexes take up less space in the graph

=== Syntax for creating a TEXT index for a relationship property

Here is the syntax for creating a TEXT index for a property of a relationship:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE TEXT INDEX <index_name> IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[x:<RELATIONSHIP_TYPE>]-()
ON (x.<property_key>)
----

You specify the name of the index, the relationship type it will be associated with, and the name of the property.

* If an index already exists in the graph with the same name, the index is not created.
* If an index does not exist in the graph with the same name:
** No index is created if there already is TEXT index for that relationship type and property key.
** Otherwise, the TEXT index is created.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create a TEXT index for a property of a node or relationship.
In the next Challenge, you will create duplicate properties in the graph to see that the TEXT index can be a benefit.
