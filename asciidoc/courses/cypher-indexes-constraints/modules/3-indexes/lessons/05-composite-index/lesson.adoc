== Why multi-property indexes?

Recall that a Node key defines multiple properties of a node that make it unique and require the properties to exist.
Previously, you created a Node key for the name and url properties of the Person nodes.
This ensured that these two values for a Person node would be unique and must exist in the graph.

A multi-property index (composite RANGE index) provides quick lookups for two or more properties of a node or relationship.

Suppose we had this query that was an important use case for our movie application:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.year = 2000 AND m.runtime <= 60
RETURN m.title, m.year, m.runtime
----

If you execute this query on the graph, you will see that it requires 27,927 total db hits to complete the query.
If you know that a query is important to your application, it would benefit from a composite index on the Movie nodes on the year and runtime properties.


=== Syntax for creating a Composite index for multiple properties of a node

Here is the syntax for creating a Composite index for multiple properties of a node:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE INDEX <index_name> IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (x:<node_label>)
ON (x.<property_key1>,x.<property_key2>,...)
----

You specify the name of the index, the node label it will be associated with, and the name of the property.

* If an index already exists in the graph with the same name, no index is created.
* If an index does not exist in the graph with the same name:
** No index is created if there already is an index for that node label and property keys.
** Otherwise, the index is created.

=== Creating the Composite index for a multiple properties of a node

We want to improve the performance of queries that test the year and runtime properties of a Movie node.

Execute this code to create the Composite index for these properties:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX Movie_year_runtime IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (x:Movie)
ON (x.year, x.runtime)
----

Repeat the above query with the `PROFILE`. You should see that with the index, only 10 total db hits occur.
The query plan now starts with the NodeIndexSeek() operation and uses the RANGE index you just created.


=== Composite index not used

If the query tests the existence of a property, it will not use this type of index.

For example, this query will not use the composite index if there are Movie nodes in the graph that do not have a year or runtime property.

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.year IS NULL AND m.runtime IS NULL
RETURN m.title, m.year, m.runtime
----

If the query tests only one property, the index will not be used:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.year = 2000
RETURN m.title, m.year, m.runtime
----


=== Syntax for creating a Composite index for a multiple properties of a relationship

Here is the syntax for creating a Composite index for a multiple properties of a relationship:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE INDEX <index_name> IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[x:<RELATIONSHIP_TYPE>]-()
ON (x.<property_key1>, x.<property_key2>,...)
----

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create a Composite index for multiple properties of a node or relationship.
In the next Challenge, you will create another Composite index and test it.
