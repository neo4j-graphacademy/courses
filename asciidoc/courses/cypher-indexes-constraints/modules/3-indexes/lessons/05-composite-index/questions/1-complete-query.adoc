= 1. Creating a Composite index

Suppose we have a graph that contains Company nodes.
We want to be able to optimize queries that test the size of the company and location, both of which are properties of Company nodes.
What is the correct statement to create this Composite index?

* [x] `CREATE INDEX Company_size_location IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Company) ON (x.size, x.location)`
* [ ] `CREATE b-tree Company_size_location IF NOT EXISTS ON (Company.size, Company.location)`
* [ ] `CREATE b-tree Company_size_location IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Company) ON (x.size, x.location)`
* [ ] `CREATE INDEX Company_size_location IF NOT EXISTS ON Company.size, Company.location`
