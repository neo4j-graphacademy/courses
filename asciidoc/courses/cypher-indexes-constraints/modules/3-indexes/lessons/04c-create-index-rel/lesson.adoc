= Creating a b-tree Index on a Relationship Property
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

== Performance improvement needed

In our Movie data model, we have identified another query as important and one that we need to make as fast as possible for our users.
Here is an example where we are testing the thr rating property value for the RATED relationships in the graph.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE r.rating >= 4
RETURN u.name, r.rating, m.title
----

**Step 1:**

Profile this query and note if an index is used. Also note the number of db hits.
It does not use an index.

**Step 2:**

Create a b-tree index for the rating property of the RATED relationship type.

* *`constraint_name`*: [copy]#RATING_rating#
* *`relationship_type`*: [copy]#RATED#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#rating#

**Step 3:**

Repeat the query with a profile.
Was your newly-created b-tree index used?
Are the number of db hits reduced?

== Summary

In this Challenge, you demonstrated that you can create a single property b-tree index on a relationship type in the graph to improve the performance of a query.
In the next lesson, you will learn how to create composite b-tree indexes.
