= Using a TEXT index
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

== Step 1: Create a new property

The database used for this course does not have the type of data that will benefit from a TEXT index.
A TEXT index performs better than a b-tree index when the property being index contains a lot of duplicate values.

Let's temporarily create some string properties in the graph that will contain many duplicates.
You will add a ratingValue property to all RATED relationships where the value is the concatenation of the user name, rating, and year of the movie.

Run this code that adds ratingInfo property to all RATING relationships (Note: It will take ~20 seconds to execute.)

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  "MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie) RETURN  left(toString(m.year),2) AS rY, id(r) AS rId",
  "MATCH ()-[r:RATED]->()  WHERE id(r) = rId SET r.ratingY = rY",
  {batchSize:1000})
----

== Step 2: Query the graph

After having added this property to all RATING relationships in the graph, we have this query that you can run:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH ()-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
// movies in the 1900's
WHERE r.ratingY CONTAINS "9"
RETURN m.title,m.year, r.rating
----

Repeat this query to get the true elapsed time and db hits. The second query is required because the first query adds the query to the query cache because it needs to parse the query and plan it.

== Step 3: Add b-tree index

Add a regular b-tree index to the graph using:

* *`index_name`*: [copy]#RATED_ratingY#
* *`relationship_type`*: [copy]#RATED#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#ratingY#

== Step 4: Repeat the query

After having added the b-tree index. Execute this query twice:
[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH ()-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
// movies in the 1900's
WHERE r.ratingY CONTAINS "9"
RETURN m.title,m.year, r.rating
----

Do you see that the b-tree index is used and the db hits and elapsed time is lower?

== Step 5: Add TEXT index

Add a TEXT index to the graph using:

* *`index_name`*: [copy]#RATED_ratingY_text#
* *`relationship_type`*: [copy]#RATED#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#ratingY#

== Step 6: Repeat the query

After having added the TEXT index. Execute this query twice:
[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH ()-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
// movies in the 1900's
WHERE r.ratingY CONTAINS "9"
RETURN m.title,m.year, r.rating
----

Do you see that the TEXT index is used?
This is because the query planner will use a TEXT index if one exists when the predicate uses `CONTAINS` or `ENDS WITH`.
Notice also that the db hits are the same but the elapsed time is lower.

== Summary

In this Challenge, you demonstrated that you can create a b-tree composite index in the graph to improve the performance of a query.
In the next lesson, you will learn how to create a TEXT index.
