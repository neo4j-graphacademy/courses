= 1. Creating a Node key constraint

Suppose we have a graph that contains Company nodes.
Every Company in the graph must have a unique name and location. These properties must be set in every Company node.
Before we load the Company data, we want to create a Node key constraint for the name and location properties.
What is the correct statement to create this constraint?

.Hint
====
You specify the type of constraint at the end of the clause for creating the constraint.

This Node key requires two properties.

The correct code for creating the uniqueness constraint is:

`CREATE CONSTRAINT Company_taxId_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Company) REQUIRE x.taxId IS UNIQUECREATE CONSTRAINT Company_name_location_nodekey IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Company) REQUIRE (x.name,x.location) IS NODE KEY`
