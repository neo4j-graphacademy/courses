= Creating Uniqueness Constraints
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

== Uniqueness required

In our Movie data model, we want to ensure that nodes are unique.
In your real application, you would create uniqueness constraints for nodes prior to loading the data.
For this course, we already have the data loaded, but we still want to constrain the graph so that nodes are unique.

In the previous lesson, you executed code to create a uniqueness constraint for Movie nodes.
In this Challenge, you will create three more uniqueness constraints in the graph.

In the sandbox on the right, modify the code to create these uniqueness constraints in the graph:

1. For the Person nodes:

* *`constraint_name`*: [copy]#Person_tmdbId_unique#
* *`node_label`*: [copy]#Person#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#tmdbId#

2. For the User nodes:

* *`constraint_name`*: [copy]#User_userId_unique#
* *`node_label`*: [copy]#User#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#userId#

3. For the Genre nodes:

* *`constraint_name`*: [copy]#Genre_name_unique#
* *`node_label`*: [copy]#Genre#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#name#

After you have created the constraints, list them:

[NOTE]
--
If you create incorrect constraints with different names or property_key names, do not worry.
You can create new ones, provided the constraint_name or property_key is unique.
Later in this course you will learn how to remove constraints from the graph.

If you reload this page, the graph will be reset to what it should be at the beginning of the challenge.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can create uniqueness constraints in the graph.
In the next lesson, you will learn how to create existence constraints.
