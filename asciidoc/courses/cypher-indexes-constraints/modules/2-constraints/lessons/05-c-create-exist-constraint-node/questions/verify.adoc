.Hint
====
Constraint names, label names, and property key names are all case-sensitive.
The node labels you should specify are for Movie and User nodes (case-sensitive).
The property keys you should specify are for title and name (case-sensitive).

If you mis-specify a label or property key, the constraint will not be created.

You can type `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` after you have created each constraint.

If you mess up, you can reload this Challenge page and you should be where you need to be at the beginning of this Challenge.
