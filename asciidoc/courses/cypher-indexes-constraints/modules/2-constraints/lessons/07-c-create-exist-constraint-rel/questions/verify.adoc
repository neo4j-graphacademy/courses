.Hint
====
Constraint names, relationship types, and property key names are all case-sensitive.

The pattern you should specify for creating the constraint is:

`()-[x:RATED]-()`

If you mis-specify a relationship type or property key, the constraint will not be created.

You can type `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` after you have created each constraint.

If you mess up, you can reload this Challenge page and you should be where you need to be at the beginning of this Challenge.
