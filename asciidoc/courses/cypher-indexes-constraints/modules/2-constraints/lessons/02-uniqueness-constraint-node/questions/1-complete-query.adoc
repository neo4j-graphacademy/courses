= 1. Creating a uniqueness constraint

Suppose we have a graph that contains Company nodes. One of the properties of a Company node is taxId.
Every Company in the graph must have a unique taxId.
Before we load the Company data, we want to create a uniqueness constraint for the Company.taxId property.

What is the correct statement to create this constraint?
