== Managing constraints

Managing constraints in the graph includes:

* Creating constraints (`CREATE CONSTRAINT...`)
* Listing constraints (`SHOW CONSTRAINTS`)
* Dropping constraints

You have already learned how to create and list the constraints in the graph.
In this lesson, you will learn how to drop a constraint.

=== Syntax for dropping a constraint

You use this statement to drop a constraint by its name:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
.Drop Constraint Syntax
----
DROP CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>
----

=== Dropping a constraint

Execute this statement to list the constraints in the graph so you can view the names of the constraints:

[source,cypher]
.List constraints
----
SHOW CONSTRAINTS
----

Now, drop the constraint that you created in the last Challenge named **Person_name_url_nodekey**.

[source,cypher]
.Dropping a Constraint
----
DROP CONSTRAINT Person_name_url_nodekey
----

=== Creating list of constraints to drop

You can use `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` to create a list of constraints to drop:

[source,cypher]
.Listing Constraints
----
SHOW CONSTRAINTS YIELD name  RETURN collect('DROP CONSTRAINT ' + name + ';') AS Statements
----

=== Using APOC for dropping all indexes and constraints

The link:https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/indexes/schema-index-operations/[APOC library^] has a number of procedures you can use to manage indexes.

Here is the code that will drop all indexes and constraints in the graph. Give it a try:

[source,cypher]
.Drop Constraints using APOC
----
CALL apoc.schema.assert({},{},true)
----

=== Recreate All Constraints

Execute this code to recreate the constraints created in this module:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT Movie_movieId_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Movie) REQUIRE x.movieId IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT Movie_released_title_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Movie) REQUIRE (x.released,x.title) IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT Person_tmdbId_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Person) REQUIRE x.tmdbId IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT User_userId_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:User) REQUIRE x.userId IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT Genre_name_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Genre) REQUIRE x.name IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT Person_name_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Person) REQUIRE x.name IS NOT NULL;
CREATE CONSTRAINT Movie_title_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Movie) REQUIRE x.title IS NOT NULL;
CREATE CONSTRAINT User_name_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:User) REQUIRE x.name IS NOT NULL;
CREATE CONSTRAINT RATED_timestamp_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR ()-[x:RATED]-() REQUIRE x.timestamp IS NOT NULL;
CREATE CONSTRAINT Movie_imdbId_nodekey IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Movie) REQUIRE x.imdbId IS NODE KEY;
CREATE CONSTRAINT Person_name_url_nodekey IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Person) REQUIRE (x.name,x.url) IS NODE KEY

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to drop constraints from the graph.
In next Challenge, you will drop some more constraints.
