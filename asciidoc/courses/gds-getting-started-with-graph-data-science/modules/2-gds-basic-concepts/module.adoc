== Module overview

In this module, you will learn:

* The three-step GDS workflow: Project → Run → Write
* How to create graph projections using Cypher queries
* Different types of graph projections: monopartite, bipartite, and multipartite
* How to manage graphs in the GDS catalog

This hands-on module uses the Movies dataset to teach practical GDS syntax and workflows.

By the end, you'll have the foundational skills needed to work with algorithms in Module 3.
