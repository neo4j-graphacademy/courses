.Solution
====
**The user rated at least one movie in that genre** is correct.

The projection pattern `User → RATED → Movie → IN_GENRE → Genre` creates connections between users and genres when users have rated movies that belong to those genres. This bipartite structure reveals user genre preferences based on their rating behavior.
