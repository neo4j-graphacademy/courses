== 2. Benefits of Label Preservation

You've created a user-genre projection with preserved labels. What advantage does this give you over a default projection?

* [ ] It uses less memory
* [ ] It runs algorithms faster
* [x] You can run algorithms on only Users or only Genres by filtering node labels
* [ ] It automatically creates recommendations

Think about what the `nodeLabels` parameter allows you to do when calling algorithms.

.Solution
====
**You can run algorithms on only Users or only Genres by filtering node labels** is correct.

When you preserve labels in your projection, you can use the `nodeLabels` configuration parameter:

```cypher
CALL gds.degree.stream('users-genres', {
  nodeLabels: ['Genre']
})
```

This runs the algorithm only on Genre nodes, showing which genres have the most user connections. Without label preservation, you can't make this distinction—all nodes are treated identically.
