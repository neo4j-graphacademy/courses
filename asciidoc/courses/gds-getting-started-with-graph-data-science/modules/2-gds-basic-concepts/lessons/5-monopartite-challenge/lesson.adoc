== Challenge: Create an actor-director collaboration network

You've learned how to create various monopartite projections. Now it's your turn to create one independently.

In this challenge, you will need to think somewhat outside the box.

All previous monopartite projections have used only one intermediate node. However, this challenge will require you to build your initial Cypher query from two intermediate nodes.

**Your task:** Create a monopartite projection of **Actor** nodes connected through directors they've both worked with.

This projection would be useful for:

- Finding actors who've worked with the same directors
- Understanding directorial influence on actor networks
- Discovering potential casting recommendations


== Requirements

Your projection should:

1. Include only `Actor` nodes
2. Connect `Actor` nodes who have worked with the same `Director` nodes
3. Name the projection `'actor-director-network'`


== Hints

Think about the pattern:

- `Actor` A acted in a `Movie`
- That movie was `DIRECTED` by a `Director`
- The same director `DIRECTED` another `Movie`
- `Actor` B acted in that other movie
- Therefore, `Actor` A and `Actor` B are connected through that director


== Solution approach

[%collapsible]
====
The pattern requires tracing through movies and directors to connect actors:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (source:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-
  (:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(target:Actor)
WITH gds.graph.project(
  'actor-director-network',
  source,
  target,
  {},
  {}
) AS g
RETURN g.graphName AS graph, 
  g.nodeCount AS nodes, 
  g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

**Key components:**

- The MATCH pattern traces through both movies and directors
- `source.name < target.name` prevents duplicates
- The projection connects actors who share directors
- This is different from direct collaboration (sharing movies)—it reveals directorial networks
====


== Verify your work

Once you've created your projection, run degree centrality to find actors who've worked with many directors who've also worked with many other actors:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.degree.stream(
  'actor-director-network'
)
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS actor, 
  score AS director_network_size
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

Actors with high scores are central to directorial networks—they've worked with directors who have also directed many other actors.

Finally, try running PageRank on the same network. Replace the graph name to complete the query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stream(
  '?????'
)
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS actor, 
  score AS influence
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

== Summary

Creating monopartite projections requires understanding the relationship patterns that connect nodes of the same type. The actor-director network demonstrates a more complex projection than simple collaboration—connecting actors through shared directors rather than shared movies.

This type of projection reveals different network dynamics:
- **Direct collaboration** (Actor → Movie ← Actor): Who worked together
- **Director network** (Actor → Movie ← Director → Movie ← Actor): Who shares directorial connections

Both are monopartite actor networks, but they reveal different aspects of the film industry ecosystem.

Next, you'll learn about bipartite graphs and when preserving two distinct node types matters for analysis.
