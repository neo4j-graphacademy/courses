.Solution
====
**They both worked with at least one director in common** is correct.

The projection pattern `Actor → Movie ← Director → Movie ← Actor` connects actors through shared directors. This is different from direct collaboration (sharing the same movie) or other types of connections. It reveals which actors are part of the same directorial networks.
