== 2. Comparing Network Types

You create two monopartite actor projections:

1. `'actor-collaboration'`: Actors connected through shared movies
2. `'actor-director-network'`: Actors connected through shared directors

What's the key difference in insights these reveal?

* [ ] They reveal the same information, just calculated differently
* [x] Collaboration shows direct co-stars; director network shows broader industry connections through directors
* [ ] Director network is always smaller than collaboration network
* [ ] Collaboration network includes directors; director network doesn't

.Solution
====
**Collaboration shows direct co-stars; director network shows broader industry connections through directors** is correct.

These projections reveal different aspects:

- **Actor collaboration**: Direct working relationships (who appeared in the same film)
- **Actor-director network**: Industry connections through shared directors (who's in the same directorial ecosystem)

An actor might have high centrality in the director network without ever appearing in the same movie as those connected actors—they're connected through the directors they've all worked with.
