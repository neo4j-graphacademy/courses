== 1. Understanding projection components

You run this projection:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (source:Author)-[r:WROTE]->(target:Article)
WITH gds.graph.project('research-network', source, target) AS g
RETURN g.graphName, g.nodeCount, g.relationshipCount
----

What nodes are included in the `'research-network'` projection?

* [ ] Only Author nodes
* [ ] Only Article nodes
* [x] Both Author nodes and Article nodes
* [ ] All nodes in the database

.Hint
====
Look at what variables are passed into `gds.graph.project()`. Both `source` and `target` are included.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Both Author nodes and Article nodes** is correct.

When you pass `source` and `target` to `gds.graph.project()`, both sets of matched nodes become part of the projection:
- `source` (Author nodes) are included
- `target` (Article nodes) are included
- The WROTE relationships between them are automatically inferred

This creates a bipartite graph with both node types.
