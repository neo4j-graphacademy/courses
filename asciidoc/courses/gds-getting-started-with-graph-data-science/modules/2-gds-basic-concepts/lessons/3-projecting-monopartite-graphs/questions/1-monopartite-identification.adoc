= Identifying Monopartite Behavior

You project a graph of customers and products using this query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (source:Customer)-[r:PURCHASED]->(target:Product)
WITH gds.graph.project(
  'customer-products',
  source,
  target,
  {},
  {}
) AS g
RETURN g.graphName, g.nodeCount, g.relationshipCount
----

How does GDS treat this projection by default?

* [ ] As a bipartite graph with Customer and Product as distinct types
* [x] As a monopartite graph where all nodes are treated as the same type
* [ ] As a normal graph with whatever labels are in the Cypher statement
* [ ] As an invalid projection because it contains two label types

Remember GDS's default behavior when no label configuration is specified.

.Solution
====
**As a monopartite graph where all nodes are treated as the same type** is correct.

By default, GDS ignores node labels and treats all nodes in a projection as a single, generic type—even if your source data has multiple labels. To preserve labels, you must explicitly configure `sourceNodeLabels` and `targetNodeLabels`.
