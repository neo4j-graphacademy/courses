= Working with algorithms
:order: 3

== Module overview

By now, you understand the fundamentals of Cypher projection and catalog management.

It's time to learn how to run and configure algorithms in tandem with your projections.

In this module, you'll learn:

* The different categories of GDS algorithms
* How to run algorithms in five execution modes
* How to interpret algorithm documentation
* How to configure algorithms for your specific needs
* How to work with undirected and weighted relationships
* When to use which algorithm type

You'll work hands-on with algorithms, learning not just the syntax but the strategy behind choosing and configuring the right algorithm for your analytical goals.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to read GDS documentation independently and run any algorithm with the appropriate configuration.

In the next module, you'll learn more advanced projection techniques that enable even more sophisticated analyses.
