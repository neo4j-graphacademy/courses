= Reading GDS documentation

When learning a new GDS algorithm from the documentation, what should you read first to understand if it's appropriate for your use case?

* [ ] The introduction, to understand the algorithm's academic and technical background
* [ ] The configuration section, to see all available parameters
* [x] The algorithm attributes header, to understand what it can and can't do
* [ ] The syntax section, to understand required parameters

Before diving into how to use an algorithm, what do you need to know about what it does?

**The attributes header, to understand what the algorithm does and what questions it answers.**

The attributes section tells you whether the algorithm is appropriate for your use case before you invest time learning its syntax.

Once you know an algorithm is right for your needs, then you can:

2. Review the introduction to understand it in more detail
3. Check the **syntax** for required parameters
4. Review **examples** for working code
5. Explore **configuration** for customization options
6. Check **results** to understand outputs

Starting with the attributes section saves time by helping you choose the right algorithm before learning its details.
