= Why use gds.util.asNode()?

You run PageRank in stream mode and get back `nodeId` and `score` values. Why do you need `gds.util.asNode()` to make these results useful?

* [ ] GDS algorithms return encrypted node IDs that must be decoded
* [x] GDS uses internal node IDs that don't contain node properties like names
* [ ] Stream mode requires a utility function to display results
* [ ] The asNode() function improves algorithm performance

What does a `nodeId` give you on its own? What do you need `gds.util.asNode()` to access?

.Solution
====
**GDS uses internal node IDs that don't contain node properties like names.**

When algorithms run in stream mode, they return `nodeId`—an internal numeric identifier that GDS uses to reference nodes efficiently.

However, `nodeId` values like `42` or `1573` aren't meaningful to humans. You can't tell which actor or movie they represent without accessing the node's properties.

`gds.util.asNode(nodeId)` converts that internal ID into an actual database node object, allowing you to access properties like `name`, `title`, `born`, etc.

This makes results human-readable:

```
// Before: nodeId=42, score=13.08
// After: name="Robert De Niro", score=13.08
```

The function doesn't decrypt anything, isn't required by stream mode specifically, and doesn't affect performance—it simply provides access to node data.
