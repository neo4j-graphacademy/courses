= Degree centrality orientation

You run Degree Centrality with `orientation: 'NATURAL'` on a directed actor collaboration network. What is the algorithm counting?

* [x] Outgoing relationships—how many other actors each actor is connected to
* [ ] Incoming relationships—how many actors connect to each actor
* [ ] Total relationships—all connections regardless of direction
* [ ] Bidirectional relationships—only connections that go both ways

.Hint
====
'NATURAL' orientation means the algorithm follows the relationships as they exist in the projection. In a directed graph, what direction do the relationships go?

**Outgoing relationships—how many other actors each actor is connected to.**

Degree Centrality with `orientation: 'NATURAL'` counts relationships in their natural direction as they exist in the projection.

In a directed graph, this means counting **outgoing** relationships from each node.

The three orientation options are:

- `'NATURAL'`: Counts outgoing relationships (follows projection direction)
- `'REVERSE'`: Counts incoming relationships  
- `'UNDIRECTED'`: Counts all relationships regardless of direction

In an actor collaboration network with directed relationships, `NATURAL` tells you how many co-stars each actor is connected to (out-degree).

Understanding orientation is crucial because it changes what "centrality" means: are you measuring who connects outward (out-degree), who receives connections (in-degree), or total connectivity (undirected)?
