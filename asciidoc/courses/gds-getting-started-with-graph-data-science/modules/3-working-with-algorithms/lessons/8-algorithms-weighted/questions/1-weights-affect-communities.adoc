= How weights affect community detection

You ran Leiden on an unweighted user-movie graph and then on the same graph weighted by rating scores.

What's the key difference between these two analyses?

* [ ] Weighted analysis runs faster because it has fewer relationships to process
* [ ] Unweighted analysis is more accurate because it doesn't introduce rating bias
* [x] Weighted analysis groups users by taste (who liked what), unweighted by viewing history (who watched what)
* [ ] Weighted analysis creates more communities while unweighted creates fewer

====
Think about what the unweighted projection considers (presence of relationships) vs. what the weighted projection considers (strength of relationships via ratings).

.Solution

**Weighted analysis groups users by taste (who liked what), unweighted by viewing history (who watched what).**

This is a critical distinction:

**Unweighted** Leiden considers only whether users rated the same movies—any rating counts equally. Users who both rated "The Matrix" are connected, regardless of whether one gave it 5 stars and the other gave it 1 star.

**Weighted** Leiden considers *how* users rated movies. The `relationshipWeightProperty: 'rating'` configuration tells Leiden to use rating values as connection strength. Now users are grouped by similar ratings—users who both gave "The Matrix" 5 stars have stronger connections than users with mismatched ratings.

This produces more nuanced communities:

- Unweighted: "These users watched similar movies"
- Weighted: "These users liked similar movies"

For recommendations, weighted communities are more meaningful—you want to recommend movies to users with similar *taste*, not just similar viewing history.

The number of communities and performance vary based on data, but the key insight is that weights let algorithms consider connection quality, not just presence.
