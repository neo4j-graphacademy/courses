= What Happens When You Rerun Label Propagation?

What do you notice if you run Label Propagation multiple times in a row on the same graph?

* [ ] You get exactly the same results every time
* [ ] The algorithm fails after the first run
* [x] You get different community assignments each time
* [ ] The number of communities always increases with each run

.Hint
====
Try running the same Label Propagation query 3-4 times. Look at the `communityId` values and community sizes. Do they stay the same?

.Solution
====
**You get different community assignments each time.**

Label Propagation is **non-deterministic**—it can produce different results on successive runs. You might notice:

- Different `communityId` values for the same nodes
- Different numbers of communities detected
- Different community sizes

This happens because Label Propagation is sensitive to:
1. **Initialization order**: Which nodes update their labels first can affect the final outcome
2. **Tie-breaking**: When a node's neighbors have equal votes for multiple labels, the algorithm must break ties randomly
3. **Update sequence**: The order in which nodes process their neighbors' labels

This is normal behavior for Label Propagation and one of its trade-offs for speed and simplicity.
