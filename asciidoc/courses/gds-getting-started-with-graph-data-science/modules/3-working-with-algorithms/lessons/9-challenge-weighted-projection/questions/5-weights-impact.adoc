= How Do Weights Affect Label Propagation?

How do relationship weights influence Label Propagation's community detection?

* [ ] Weights have no effect on Label Propagation
* [ ] Weights only affect the algorithm's performance, not the results
* [x] Weights make stronger connections more influential in the neighbor voting process
* [ ] Weights determine the maximum number of communities that can be detected

.Hint
====
Consider how a node with highly-rated film connections (`imdbRating: 9.5`) should be influenced compared to connections with poorly-rated films (`imdbRating: 3.2`).

.Solution
====
**Weights make stronger connections more influential in the neighbor voting process.**

In weighted Label Propagation:

**Unweighted behavior:**
Each neighbor gets one "vote" for its community label, regardless of connection strength.

**Weighted behavior:**
Each neighbor's vote is weighted by the relationship property. A neighbor connected by a high-weight relationship (`imdbRating: 9.2`) has more influence than a neighbor connected by a low-weight relationship (`imdbRating: 4.1`).

**In your actor-movie network:**
- Actors and movies connected through highly-rated films have stronger influence on each other's community assignment
- Communities tend to form around quality collaborations rather than just any collaboration
- This produces more meaningful clusters based on film success, not just co-appearance

Weights essentially amplify or diminish each neighbor's influence in the voting process, allowing the algorithm to prioritize important connections over weak ones.
