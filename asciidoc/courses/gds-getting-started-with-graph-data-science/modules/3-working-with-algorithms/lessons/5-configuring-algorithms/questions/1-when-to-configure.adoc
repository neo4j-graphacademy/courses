= When to customize configuration

When should you customize algorithm configuration instead of using defaults?

* [ ] Always—defaults are just starting points and should never be used in production
* [ ] Never—defaults are optimized and customization usually makes results worse
* [x] When defaults don't meet your needs based on results or specific requirements
* [ ] Only when the documentation explicitly requires configuration changes

**When defaults don't meet your needs based on results or specific requirements.**

The recommended workflow is:

1. **Start with defaults** to see baseline behavior
2. **Evaluate results** against your analytical goals
3. **Customize if needed** based on what you observe

Customize configuration when:

- Default results don't answer your question (e.g., PageRank's default dampingFactor doesn't model your influence pattern)
- You need to filter data (e.g., run only on specific node types with `nodeLabels`)
- Performance needs adjustment (e.g., increase `concurrency` on large graphs)
- You're tuning for specific behaviors (e.g., adjust Leiden's `gamma` for different community granularity)

Defaults aren't always wrong, but they're general-purpose settings. Customization lets you adapt algorithms to your specific data and questions.

However, customize thoughtfully—random changes without understanding can produce meaningless results.
