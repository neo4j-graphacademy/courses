= GDS advantages

What advantage does GDS provide over pure Cypher?

* GDS is faster at storing data than Cypher
* GDS replaces the need for Cypher queries entirely
* [x] GDS enables analyzing data at various levels of granularity with specialized algorithms
* GDS can only work with tabular data formats

.Hint
====
Consider what the Leiden algorithm did in the example—could you easily replicate that with standard Cypher queries?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
While Cypher is powerful for querying graph data, GDS provides specialized algorithms that can analyze your data at various levels of granularity and from a wide range of approaches. For example, GDS algorithms can detect communities, measure influence, and find patterns that would be extremely complex to implement with Cypher alone.
