= Algorithm assumptions

You've projected a **bipartite** graph with Directors and Actors. You want to measure "which directors have made the most movies."

Why might **Degree Centrality** be a better choice than **PageRank** for this bipartite graph?

* [ ] PageRank doesn't work on bipartite graphs at all
* [ ] Degree Centrality is always faster than PageRank
* [x] Both could work, but degree centrality literally counts relationships directly
* [ ] Degree Centrality gives more accurate results in all cases

Think about what the question is asking: counting movies. What does Degree Centrality literally count in a bipartite Director -> Actor graph?

**Both could work, but degree centrality literally counts relationships directly.**

When the question asks "which directors have made the most movies," you're essentially asking a counting question. Degree Centrality directly counts the number of relationships each director has to actors in this projection.

While PageRank *could* work on a bipartite graph, it's measuring something more abstract (importance through network position), not a direct count. If your goal is simply to count, Degree Centrality is the more straightforward choice.

In a Director -> Actor bipartite graph, Degree Centrality gives you "this director worked with X actors," which is a clear proxy for productivity and film output.
