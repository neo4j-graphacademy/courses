= Essential projection techniques
:order: 4

== Module overview

You've learned how to create basic projections and run algorithms with various configurations.

Now it's time to add some more advanced projection configurations to your arsenal.

In this module, you'll learn:

* How to aggregate multiple relationships into weighted connections
* When to use relationship aggregation for performance and insight
* How to design projections based on analytical questions
* How to match projection structure to algorithm requirements
* How to think strategically about projection modeling

This module brings together everything you've learned about projections, combining them with your algorithm knowledge to solve complex analytical problems.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to independently design and implement GDS solutions from analytical question through to projection, algorithm selection, and result interpretation.

You'll have all the foundational skills needed to apply GDS to real-world problems in the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/gds-applied-algorithms/[Applied Algorithms in GDS^] course.
