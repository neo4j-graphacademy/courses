== Course Description

This foundational course takes you from GDS basics through to confident, independent algorithm work.

You'll learn the fundamentals: what graph data science is, how to create projections for different analytical questions, how to choose and configure algorithms, and how to interpret results.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to read GDS documentation independently, run any algorithm, and design projections that match your analytical goals.

This course prepares you for the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/gds-applied-algorithms/[Applied Algorithms in GDS^] course, where you'll see these techniques solve real-world industry problems.

The course automatically creates a new `movie recommendations` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.


== Prerequisites

This course is intended for analysts and data scientists who have:

* Basic understanding of graphs and graph databases
* Familiarity with basic Cypher query language
* No prior GDS experience required


== Duration

3-4 hours


== What you will learn

* What graph data science is and how it differs from traditional data science
* How to create and manage graph projections (monopartite, bipartite, multipartite)
* The five main algorithm categories and when to use each
* How to run algorithms in five different execution modes
* How to configure algorithms with orientation, weights, and parameters
* How to aggregate relationships during projection
* How to design projections based on analytical questions
* How to read GDS documentation independently
