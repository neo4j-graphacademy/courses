= Create a Vector Index
:order: 3
:type: lesson
:sandbox: true

To query embeddings, you need to create a vector index. 
A vector index significantly increases the speed of similarity searches by pre-computing the similarity between vectors and storing them in the index.

In this lesson, you will create vector indexes on the `embedding` property of the `Question` and `Answer` nodes.

== Create the Question Index

You will use the `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` Cypher statement to create the index:

.CREATE VECTOR INDEX Syntax
[source,cypher, role=noplay nocopy]
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX [index_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName)
ON (n.propertyName)
OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"
----

`CREATE VECTOR INDEX` expects the following parameters:

* `index_name` - The name of the index
* `LabelName` - The node label on which to index
* `propertyName` - The property on which to index
* `OPTIONS` - The options for the index, where you can specify:
** `vector.dimensions` - The dimension of the embedding e.g. OpenAI embeddings consist of `1536` dimensions.
** `vector.similarity_function` - The similarity function to use when comparing values in this index - this can be `euclidean` or `cosine`.

Review and run the following Cypher to create the vector index:

.Create the vector index
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX questions IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (q:Question)
ON q.embedding
OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
 `vector.dimensions`: 1536,
 `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}}
----

Note that the index is called `questions`, is against the `Question` label, and is on the `.embedding` property. The `vector.dimensions` is `1536` (as used by OpenAI) and the `vector.similarity_function` is `cosine`. The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement only creates the index if it does not already exist.

Run the statement to create the index.

[TIP]
.Choosing a Similarity Function
====
Generally, cosine will perform best for text embeddings, but you may want to experiment with other functions.

You can link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes-for-vector-search/#indexes-vector-similarity[read more about similarity functions in the documentation^].

Typically, you will choose a similarity function closest to the loss function used when training the embedding model. You should refer to the model's documentation for more information.

=== Check the index creation status

The index will be updated asynchronously. You can check the status of the index population using the `SHOW INDEXES` statement:

Check that you created the index successfully using the `SHOW INDEXES` command.

.Show Indexes
[source,cypher]
----
SHOW INDEXES WHERE type = "VECTOR"
----

You should see a result similar to the following:

.Show Indexes Result
|===
| id | name | state | populationPercent | type
|1 | "questions" | "ONLINE" | `100.0` | "VECTOR"
|===

Once the `state` is listed as online, the index will be ready to query.

The `populationPercentage` field indicates the proportion of node and property pairing.

When the `populationPercentage` is `100.0`, all the movie embeddings have been indexed.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create a vector index using the `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` Cypher statement.

In the next lesson, you will use what you have learned to create a vector index for the `Answer` nodes.
