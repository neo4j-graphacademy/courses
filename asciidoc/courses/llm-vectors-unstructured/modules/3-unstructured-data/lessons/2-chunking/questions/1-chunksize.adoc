.Solution
====
The correct phrase is:

_"When chunking data, *you need to be aware of the size of the chunk, as embedding models can only handle a certain amount of data.*"_

The other statements are incorrect. The chunk size should be chosen carefully to ensure that the model can handle it and that the results are meaningful.
