= Creating embeddings
:order: 4
:type: lesson

In the last lesson, embeddings were automatically created for you by the `Neo4jVector` class.

You are going to learn how to create embeddings directly and query Neo4j using Python.

Publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) will typically have an API that you can use to create embeddings for text.

For example, OpenAI has an API that you can use to create embeddings for text.

The `llm-vectors-unstructured/create_embeddings.py` program uses the OpenAI API and Python library to create embeddings for text.

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/llm-vectors-unstructured/create_embeddings.py[]
----

You should be able to identify:

* The `OpenAI` class requires an API key to be passed to it.
* The `llm.embeddings.create` method is used to create an embedding for a piece of text.
* The `text-embedding-ada-002` model is used to create the embedding.
* The `response.data[0].embedding` attribute is used to access the embedding.

Run the program and you should see the embedding returned:

----
[-0.02844466269016266, 0.009961248375475407, 0.0017426918493583798, -0.01016482524573803, 0.019080106168985367, 0.02178979106247425, -0.01836407743394375, -0.005099962465465069, -0.014285510405898094, ... ]
----

Experiment by changing the input text - you will see the embeddings change.

== Query neo4j with an embedding

Next, you are going to use the embedding to query the Neo4j `chunkVector` vector index you created in the last lesson.

Open the `llm-vectors-unstructured/query_neo4j.py` program:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/llm-vectors-unstructured/query_neo4j.py[]
----

The program includes the code to create an embedding.

You will need to add the code to query Neo4j using the embedding.

First, import the langchain `Neo4jGraph` class and create an object which will connect to the Neo4j sandbox:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/llm-vectors-unstructured/solutions/query_neo4j.py[tag=importgraph]

include::{repository-raw}/main/llm-vectors-unstructured/solutions/query_neo4j.py[tag=connect]
----

[NOTE]
The `Neo4jGraph` class provides a simple mechanism with Langchain to interact with Neo4j. It is not a full-featured Neo4j client.

Use the `query` method to run the Cypher to query the `chunkVector` index using the embedding:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/llm-vectors-unstructured/solutions/query_neo4j.py[tag=query]
----

The embedding is passed to the `query` method as a key/value pair in a dictionary.

Finally, iterate through the `result` and print the `node.text` and `score`.

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/llm-vectors-unstructured/solutions/query_neo4j.py[tag=query]
----

When running the program, you should see the chunk text printed followed by the score.

Try modifying the input text and see how the results change.

When you have successfully queried Neo4j using the embedding, you can move on to the next lesson.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you used the OpenAI API to create an embedding and queried Neo4j using Python.

In the next lesson, you will create a graph of the course content.
