. Download the content for all the courses - link:https://data.neo4j.com/llm-vectors-unstructured/courses.zip[data.neo4j.com/llm-vectors-unstructured/courses.zip^]
. Update the graph with the new data
. Explore the graph and find the connections between the courses

== Additional metadata 

While the course content is unstructured, it contains metadata you can extract and include in the graph.

Examples include:

* The course title is the first level 1 heading in the file - `= Course Title`
* Level 2 headings denote section titles - `== Section Title`
* The lessons include parameters in the format `:parameter: value` at the top of the file, such as:
** `:type:`
** `:order:`
** `:optional:`

Explore the course content and see what other data you can extract and include in the graph.
