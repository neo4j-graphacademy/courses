In this *optional* challenge, you can extend the graph with additional data.

== All Courses

Currently, the graph contains data from a single course, `llm-fundamentals`, you can download the link:https://data.neo4j.com/llm-vectors-unstructured/courses.zip[lesson files for all the courses^].

. Download the content for all the courses - link:https://data.neo4j.com/llm-vectors-unstructured/courses.zip[data.neo4j.com/llm-vectors-unstructured/courses.zip^]
. Update the graph with the additional course data
. Explore the graph and find the connections between the courses

[NOTE]

====
Alternatively, you could clone Neo4j GraphAcademy courses repository from link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses[https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses]. However, all the data you will need is in the zip file.

== Additional metadata 

While the course content is unstructured, it contains metadata you can extract and include in the graph.

Examples include:

* The course title is the first level 1 heading in the file - `= Course Title`
* Level 2 headings denote section titles - `== Section Title`
* The lessons include parameters in the format `:parameter: value` at the top of the file, such as:
** `:type:` - the type of lesson (e.g. `lesson`, `challenge`, `quiz`)
** `:order:` - the order of the lesson in the module
** `:optional:` - whether the lesson is optional

Explore the course content and see what other data you can extract and include in the graph.
You may also find that the content could be split into different nodes, such as sections, which may give you more accurate results.
