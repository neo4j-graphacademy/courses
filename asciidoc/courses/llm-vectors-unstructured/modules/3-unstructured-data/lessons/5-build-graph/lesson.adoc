= Create a graph
:order: 5
:type: lesson
:disable-cache: true
:sandbox: true

In the last lesson, you used the `Neo4jVector` class to create nodes in the graph.
Using `Neo4jVector` is an efficient and easy way to get started.
To create a graph where you can also understand the relationships within the data, you must incorporate the metadata into the data model.

In this lesson, you will create a graph of the course content using the `neo4j` Python driver and OpenAI API.

== Data Model

The data model you will create is a simplified version of the course content model you saw earlier in this module.

image::images/graphacademy-simple-graph.svg[Data model showing Course, Module, Lesson and Paragraph nodes and their relationships,width=700,align=center]

The graph will contain the following nodes, properties, and relationships:

- `Course`, `Module`, and `Lesson` nodes with a `name` property
- A `url` property on `Lesson` nodes will hold the GraphAcademy URL for the lesson
- `Paragraph` nodes will have `text` and `embedding` property
- The `HAS_MODULE`, `HAS_LESSON`, and `CONTAINS` relationships will connect the nodes

You can extract the `name` properties and `url` metadata from the directory structure of the lesson files.
For example, the first lesson of the Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals course has the following path:

[source]
----
courses\llm-fundamentals\modules\1-introduction\lessons\1-neo4j-and-genai\lesson.adoc
----

You can extract the following metadata from the path:

- `Course.name` - `llm-fundamentals`
- `Module.name` - `1-introduction`
- `Lesson.name` - `1-neo4j-and-genai`
- `Lesson.url` - `graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/{Course.name}/{Module.name}/{Lesson.name}`

== Extracting the data

Create a new Python program and start with the code you used to load and chunk the content.

.Load and chunk the content
[source, python]
----
include::../3-import-python/code/load_and_chunk.py[]
----

For each chunk, you have to create an embedding of the text and extract the metadata.

Create a function to create and return an embedding using the OpenAI API:

.Create embeddings
[source, python]
----
def get_embedding(llm, text):
    response = llm.embeddings.create(
            input=chunk.page_content,
            model="text-embedding-ada-002"
        )
    return response.data[0].embedding
----

Create a 2nd function, which will extract the data from the chunk:

.Get course data
[source, python]
----
import os

def get_course_data(llm, chunk):
    data = {}

    path = chunk.metadata['source'].split(os.path.sep)

    data['course'] = path[-6]
    data['module'] = path[-4]
    data['lesson'] = path[-2]
    data['url'] = f"https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/{data['course']}/{data['module']}/{data['lesson']}"
    data['text'] = chunk.page_content
    data['embedding'] = get_embedding(llm, data['text'])

    return data
----

The `get_course_data` function:

. Splits the document source path to extract the `course`, `module`, and `lesson` names
. Constructs the `url` using the extracted names
. Extracts the `text` from the chunk
. Creates an `embedding` using the `get_embedding` function
. Returns a dictionary containing the extracted data

== Create the graph

To create the graph, you will need to:

. Create an OpenAI object to generate the embeddings
. Connect to the Neo4j database
. Iterate through the chunks
. Extract the course data from each chunk
. Create the nodes and relationships in the graph

Create the OpenAI object:

[source, python]
----
from openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
----

Connect to the Neo4j sandbox:

[source, python]
----
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
    NEO4J_URI,
    auth=(
        NEO4J_USERNAME,
        NEO4J_PASSWORD
    )
)
driver.verify_connectivity()
----

[IMPORTANT]
.OpenAI API Key and connection details
====
Remember to update the code to include your OpenAI `OPENAI_API_KEY` and use the `NEO4J_URL`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` of your Neo4j sandbox.

Sandbox connection details:

NEO4J_URL:: [copy]#bolt://{sandbox_ip}:{sandbox_boltPort}#
NEO4J_USERNAME:: [copy]#{sandbox_username}#
NEO4J_PASSWORD:: [copy]#{sandbox_password}#
====

[TIP]
.Test the connection
====
You could run your code now to check that you can connect to the OpenAI API and Neo4j sandbox.
====

To create the data in the graph, you will need a function that incorporates the course data into a Cypher statement and runs it in a transaction.

.Create chunk function
[source, python]
----
def create_chunk(tx, data):
    tx.run("""
        MERGE (c:Course {name: $course})
        MERGE (c)-[:HAS_MODULE]->(m:Module{name: $module})
        MERGE (m)-[:HAS_LESSON]->(l:Lesson{name: $lesson, url: $url})
        MERGE (l)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Paragraph{text: $text})
        WITH p
        CALL db.create.setNodeVectorProperty(p, "embedding", $embedding)
        """,
        data
        )
----

The `create_chunk` function will accept the `data` dictionary created by the `get_course_data` function.

You should be able to identify the `$course`, `$module`, `$lesson`, `$url`, `$text`, and `$embedding` parameters in the Cypher statement.

Iterate through the chunks and execute the `create_chunk` function:

[source, python]
----
for chunk in chunks:
    with driver.session(database="neo4j") as session:

        session.execute_write(
            create_chunk,
            get_course_data(llm, chunk)
        )
----

A new session is created for each chunk. The `execute_write` method calls the `create_chunk` function, passing the `data` dictionary created by the `get_course_data` function.

Finally, close the driver.

[source, python]
----
driver.close()
----

== Explore the graph

Run the code to create the graph.
It will take a minute or two to complete as it creates the embeddings for each paragraph.

View the graph by running the following Cypher:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Course)-[:HAS_MODULE]->(m:Module)-[:HAS_LESSON]->(l:Lesson)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Paragraph)
RETURN *
----

image::images/course-graph-result.svg[Result from the Cypher, a graph showing Course, Module, Lesson and Chunk nodes and their relationships,width=700,align=center]



You will need to create a vector index to query the paragraph embeddings.

[source, cypher]
.Create Vector Index
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX paragraphs IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (p:Paragraph)
ON p.embedding
OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
 `vector.dimensions`: 1536,
 `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}}
----

You can use the vector index and the graph to find a lesson to help with specific questions:

[source, cypher]
.Find a lesson
----
WITH genai.vector.encode(
    "How does RAG help ground an LLM?",
    "OpenAI",
    { token: "sk-..." }) AS userEmbedding
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('paragraphs', 6, userEmbedding)
YIELD node, score
MATCH (l:Lesson)-[:CONTAINS]->(node)
RETURN l.name, l.url, score
----

Explore the graph and see how the relationships between the nodes can bring additional meaning to the unstructured data.
