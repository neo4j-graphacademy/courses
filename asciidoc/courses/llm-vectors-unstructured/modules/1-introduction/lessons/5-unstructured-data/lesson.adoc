:type: lesson

In this lesson, you will learn about unstructured data and the challenges it presents. You will also learn how vectors and graphs can help you understand and find the data you need, even when it's unstructured.


== What is unstructured data

Unstructured data refers to information that doesn't fit neatly into pre-defined structures and types.
It includes all sorts of data formats that aren't easily categorized or organized in a predefined manner.
Examples of unstructured data are text files, emails, social media posts, videos, photos, audio files, and web pages.

Unstructured data is often rich in information but challenging to analyze because it lacks a predictable structure or format.

For example, an email from a customer might contain valuable feedback about a product, but it's hard to extract and analyze this information without reading and interpreting the email.
The information in the email may have to be extracted manually and put into a structured format to analyze it.

== Challenges

Analyzing unstructured data presents various challenges due to its nature and characteristics.
Here are some considerations why it requires additional attention:

* **Lack of Structure** - Unstructured data doesn't follow a predefined model or format, making it hard to organize and interpret.
* **Volume** - There's often a massive amount of unstructured data, which can be overwhelming to process and analyze efficiently.
* **Variety** - Unstructured data comes in many formats (text, images, videos, etc.), each requiring different techniques and tools for analysis.
* **Quality and Consistency** - The quality of unstructured data can vary greatly, with inconsistencies, errors, or irrelevant information complicating analysis.
* **Contextual Understanding** - Understanding the meaning of unstructured data requires complex analysis and often human interpretation.

== Vectors and Graphs

Vectors and embeddings can represent unstructured data, making it easier to identify similarities and search for related data.

Graphs are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing unstructured data.
Graphs can help to visualize and understand the relationships and connections between different data points.

When adding these tools to your data analysis toolkit, you can better understand and find the data you need, even when it's unstructured.

For example, you can use vectors to find the correct documentation to support a customer query and a graph to understand the relationships between different products and customer feedback.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about unstructured data and the challenges of analyzing it.

In the next lesson, you will explore a data set of movie posters and use embeddings and a vector index to search for similar images.
