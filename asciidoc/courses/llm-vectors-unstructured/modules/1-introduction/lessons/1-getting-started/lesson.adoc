Welcome to "Introduction to Vector Indexes and Unstructured Data".

In this course, you will explore the concepts of semantic search, embedding, and vectors. You will learn how to process and index unstructured data, and use vector indexes to search for similar items.

You will explore unstructured datasets and how they can be modeled and indexed in a graph database.

You will create a graph of the unstructured course content from GraphAcademy, extract metadata from the content, and use Cypher to query the data.
