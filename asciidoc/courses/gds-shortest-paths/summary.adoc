= Course Summary

Congratulations!

You should now be able to find the shortest paths between pairs of nodes in the graph using examples for both weighted and unweighted relationships.

You have learned:

* Using Cypher to find the shortest paths between a pair of nodes
* What is the difference between weighted and unweighted relationships
* How to use GDS to find the weighted shortest paths

//== Next Steps

//Now you have a good understanding of the Neo4j GDS Library, you can advance to the
// link:/courses/graph-data-science-fundamentals/[Graph Data Science Fundamentals^] course where you will learn all you need to know about Graph Algorithms, the algorithms available in GDS and how Machine Learning Pipelines can be used to perform common a range of graph-related ML tasks.
