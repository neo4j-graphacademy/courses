== Course Description

This course teaches you how to find the shortest paths between pairs of nodes in the graph and includes examples for both weighted and unweighted relationships.

The course automatically creates a new `graph data science` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=graph-data-science2[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.


=== Prerequisites

This course is intended for analysts and data scientists who have basic knowledge of:
