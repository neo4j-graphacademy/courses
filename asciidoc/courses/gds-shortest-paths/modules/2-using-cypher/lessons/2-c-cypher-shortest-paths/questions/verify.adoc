= How many flights you have to take to get from BNA to HKT?

We are interested in finding the shortest path between Nashville (BNA) and Phuket (HKT) airports. You can filter nodes using the `iata` (airport code) property.

Replace the `???` in the query on the right of the screen to:

. Filter `source` and `target` nodes to BNA and HKT airports using the `iata` property.
. Update the `shortestPath` function to use a path between `source` and `target` nodes via the `HAS_ROUTE` relationship.

The `length` function returns the **length of the path** (number of relationships).

Enter the *length* of the shortest path between [copy]#`BNA`# and [copy]#`HKT`# airports:

.Hint
====
In the previous lesson, you reviewed this Cypher query that found the shortest path between the cities of Baltimore and Frankfurt:

[source, cypher, role=noplay nocopy]
----
MATCH (source:Airport {city:"Baltimore"}),
      (target:Airport {city:"Frankfurt"})
MATCH p = shortestPath((source)-[:HAS_ROUTE*1..10]->(target)) 
RETURN p

The answer is *3*.

You can use the following query to find the shortest route between Nashville (BNA) to Phuket (HKT):
