= Challenge: Cypher shortest paths
:order: 2
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true


In the previous lesson, you learned that the `shortestPath()` Cypher function will return the single shortest, unweighted path between two nodes.

The output of this function is a `Path` object, which you pass to the the `length()` function to find the length of the shortest path.

You will now use this knowledge to execute a Cypher query in the integrated Sandbox window to the right of the screen.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated your skills in finding the shortest unweighted path between two nodes.

In the next challenge, you will use the `allShortestPaths()` function to identify multiple shortest paths between nodes.
