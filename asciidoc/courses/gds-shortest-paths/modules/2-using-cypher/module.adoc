= Finding Shortest Paths using Cypher
:order: 2

== Module Overview

In this module, you will learn how to use the Cypher query language to find the shortest paths between pairs of nodes in the graph.


== Domain model for this course

Throughout this course, we will be querying the `graph data science` dataset which consists of airports and their geographical information.

* `(:Airport)` nodes are identified by a unique `.iata` property, a `.name`, and latitude and longitude data held in a `.location` point property.
* Airports have an outgoing relationships to `(:Region)`, `(:Continent)`, `(:Country)`  and `(:City)` nodes which creates a geographical hierarchy.
* Airports are linked together through `:HAS_ROUTE` relationships, signifying where it is possible to travel from that airport.
* Each `:HAS_ROUTE` relationship has a `.distance` property which we will use to calculate the _cost_ of travelling between two airports.
