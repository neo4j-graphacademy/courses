[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The solution is very similar to the Dijkstra example.

You can use the same configuration as before, and only add the `k`   parameter.
Make sure you copy the *totalCost* value of the third row as that is what the question is asking for.

MATCH (source:Airport {iata: "BNA"}), (target:Airport {iata:"HKT"})
CALL gds.shortestPath.yens.stream('routes',
.....
) YIELD totalCost;

.Solution
====
You can run the following Cypher statement to identify the three shortest paths from Nashville to Phuket.

The statement uses a `WHERE` clause to only return the result where the `index` value is `2` (representing the third row from a zero-based index).
