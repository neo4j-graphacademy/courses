Now for another challenge.

There may be many circumstances where the shortest weighted path may not be the most optimal, the departure time may be unsuitable or services on the flight may not be adequate.

In this case, it would make sense to find multiple options to give the end-user choice.

As mentioned, you want to display alternative routes to your users in your application.
Use the Yen's algorithm to identify the three shortest paths from Nashville (BNA) to Phuket (HKT).

What is the total cost of traversing the **third** shortest path from Nashville to Phuket?
