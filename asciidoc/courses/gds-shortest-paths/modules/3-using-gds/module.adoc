= Using the Graph Data Science library

== Module Overview

In the previous module, you learned about unweighted shortest paths and the built-in Cypher functions that allow you to identify them.

This module will introduce the concept of **weighted** relationships and how to find shortest weighted paths with the Graph Data Science library.

In this module, you will learn:

* The characteristics of a weighted relationship.
* How to find shortest weighted paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
* How to find k-shortest weighted paths using Yen's algorithm.
