.Hint
====
When you run the projection command it will return multiple pieces of information. To filter that down to just `relationshipCount` you can use the `YIELD` clause like so:
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
.....
) YIELD relationshipCount;
----
====


[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
You can run the following Cypher statement to create the graph projection.

The statement returns a single value from the procedure call, `relationshipCount`, which can be copied and pasted into the textbox above.
