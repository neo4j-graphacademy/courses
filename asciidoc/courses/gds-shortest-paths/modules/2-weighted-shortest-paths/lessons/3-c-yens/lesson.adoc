== Lesson Summary

In this lesson we went over native projections, the primary graph projection mechanism in GDS.  Native Projections are optimized for efficiency and performance to support graph data science at scale.

In the next lesson we will go over Cypher projections, an alternative mechanism for projecting graphs in GDS.
