= Weighted shortest paths

== Module Overview

In the previous module you learned how to find shortest unweighted paths with Cypher.
This module will introduce the concept of weighted relationships and how to find shortest weighted paths with the Graph Data Science library.

In this module, you will learn:

* what is a weighted relationship
* finding shortest weighted paths with Dijkstra's algorithm
* finding k-shortest weighted paths with Yen's algorithm
