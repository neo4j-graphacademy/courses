= Using graphs to solve shortest paths
:order: 1

== Module Overview

This module will provide a high-level overview of why you should use a graph database to identify the shortest paths between various data points.
As opposed to a traditional relational database structure, using a graph-based approach to representing your data lowers the complexity and increases the performance of finding the shortest paths.
In the second part of this model, you will learn how to use Cypher query language to find the shortest paths between pairs of nodes in the graph.

In this module, we will cover two core areas:

* *Why use graphs to calculate shortest paths* - What is the benefit of using a graph database
* *Using Cypher to find shortest paths* - Cypher syntax to find the shortest paths
