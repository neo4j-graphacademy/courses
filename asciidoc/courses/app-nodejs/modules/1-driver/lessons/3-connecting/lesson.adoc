= Adding the Driver
:type: challenge
:order: 3
:branch: 01-connect-to-neo4j
:test-number: 01
:lab: {repository-blob}/main/src/neo4j.js

This is your first challenge of this course.
Your challenge here is to modify the code to create a new instance of the Driver that can be used across the application.

As we discussed in the link:../1-about/[About the Driver lesson], it is best practice to create a single instance of the driver in our application per Neo4j cluster or DBMS.

Inside `src/neo4j.js`, you will see an `initDriver()` function, and above a `let driver` declaration.

.src/neo4j.js
[source,js,role=nocopy]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/neo4j.js[tag=driver]

include::{repository-raw}/main/src/neo4j.js[tag=initDriver]
----

This function should use the `uri`, `username` and `password` parameters supplied to create an instance of the Neo4j JavaScript Driver and assign it to the `driver` variable.

Below, the `getDriver()` function will provide other modules in the application with access to the `driver` variable set in `initDriver()`.

== Challenge: Implement the initDriver function.

Your first challenge is to modify the `initDriver()` function in `src/neo4j.js` to create an instance of the driver and assign it to the `driver` variable declared above.
To do this, we will need to:

1. Install the `neo4j-driver` dependency.
2. Import the dependency into `neo4j.js`.
3. Create the driver instance with the  `uri`, `username` and `password` parameters passed to the function and use the `verifyConnectivity` method to assert that the credentials are correct.


Open `src/neo4j.js`


=== 1. Install the neo4j-driver Dependency

First, you will need to install the `neo4j-driver` dependency.
Run the following command in a new terminal session:

[.tab]
.NPM
====
.Install neo4j-driver using NPM
[source,sh]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/install.txt[tag="npm"]
----
====

[.tab]
.Yarn
====
.Install neo4j-driver using Yarn
[source,sh]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/install.txt[tag="yarn"]
----
====

[TIP]
Using the `--save` option adds the entry to the list of dependencies in our `package.json` file.


=== 2. Importing the Dependency

To include the Driver dependency in our module, you will add an `import` command to the top of the file.
Copy and paste the following code at the top of `src/neo4j.js`.

[source,js,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.js[tag=import]
----


=== 3. Creating the Driver Instance

Create the driver instance by calling the `neo4j.driver()` method.
The first argument will be the `uri` passed as the first parameter to the function.
The second argument will be an authentication token which can be created using the `neo4j.auth.basic()` function, this takes two arguments; `username` and `password`


Replace the `initDriver` placeholder function with the following code:

.src/neo4j.js
[source,js]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/neo4j.js[tag=driver]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/neo4j.js[tag=initDriver]
----

In the last line of the function above, the `verifyConnectivity()` function will verify that the connection details are correct.

If the connection cannot be made for any reason, the Promise will be rejected.
If this occurs, your application will be unable to communicate with Neo4j.
Manual investigation will be required to diagnose the issue.


If the connection has been successfully verified, the Promise will resolve with an instance of the driver.




// == Testing Connectivity
include::../../../../includes/test.adoc[]

// To test that the driver has been setup correctly, run the following command in a new terminal session:

// [source,sh]
// npm run test 01

// The test file is located at `test/challenges/01-connecting-to-neo4j.spec.js`.

== Lesson Summary

You have implemented the code to create a new driver instance with server credentials held in the project's environment variables.
The code also verifies that the driver can connect to the DBMS before the application starts.

In the next module we will look at how to use the driver to query the DBMS.
