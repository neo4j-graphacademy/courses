* `example/` - Example code for driver instantiation.
* `src/` - The application code:
** `middleware/` - Some custom middleware functions that are used by Express including generic error handling.
** `passport/` - Logic required for user authentication.
** `routes/` - Route handlers that are registered on the server.  You shouldn't need to edit these files.
