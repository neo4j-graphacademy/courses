The challenges in this course use a service called link:https://gitpod.io[GitPod^] to issue code challenges.
We have chosen Gitpod because it means that you can complete the course directly in your browser without having to download or install any additional software.

To use GitPod you must sign in with your GitLab, GitHub or Bitbucket account.

== Explore the Repository

You can open the repository by clicking the link below:

Here are some of the important directories in the project:

// * `.env` - This file holds environment variables for the server and is parsed by the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv[`dotenv`^] library.
* `example/` - Example code for driver instantiation.
* `src/` - The application code:
** `middleware/` - Some custom middleware functions that are used by Express including generic error handling.
** `passport/` - Logic required for user authentication.
** `routes/` - Route handlers that are registered on the server.  You shouldn't need to edit these files.
** `services/` - Services that you will need to update to interact with Neo4j.
* `test/` - Test files that will you will need to run in order to pass the test.  You will run these using the `npm run test` or `yarn run test` command.
* `public/` - Minified build files for the SPA.  *Do not edit these files*.


== Course Challenges

For each challenge, you will be provided with a link to re-open the correct file within the repository.
Clicking these links will also set the credentials
load environment variables for your link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com[Neo4j Sandbox^] instance.
