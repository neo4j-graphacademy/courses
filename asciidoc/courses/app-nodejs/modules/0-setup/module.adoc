= Project Setup
:order: 0

As part of this course, you will work on a link:https://github.com/{repository}[pre-built repository^] for the fictional client **Neoflix**.
The course is designed to be framework agnostic, so although we have chosen a specific framework, the tasks that you will perform will be the same regardless of your choice of framework.

In the early stages you will learn some of the theory required and then use that knowledge to implement a set of features in the API.

// We have put together a project with all of the boilerplate in place. As we move through this course, you will learn some theory and then how to apply it to the example project.

// We are assuming that in taking this course, you already have at least a basic understanding of Node.js.

// Let's get started!




// In this module, we will perform the prerequisites in order to


// == Objectives

// At the end of this module, you will have learned how install the Neo4j JavaScript Driver dependency within the project, connect to your Neo4j Sandbox Account and run both read and write queries against the database.

// * Clone the Neoflix example project and start the API
// * Install the Neo4j JavaScript Driver
// * Create an instance of the Driver
// * Create a session, and run an example query
// * Learn how to write to Neo4j by registering the User
// * Learn how to read from Neo4j by implementing a Read Transaction

// Throughout the course you will be asked to run one of a set of tests to verify that you have completed the steps.


== Repository Information

We have built a repository that takes care of the boiler plate, so you can focus on implementing the functionality.


* The project is designed to work with Node.js version **16.15.1**
* Packages can be installed with either NPM or Yarn
* A web server has been built with link:https://expressjs.com/[Express^]
** Authentication is handled with link:https://www.passportjs.org/[passport^] and link:https://jwt.io/[JWT Tokens^]
** Passwords are encrypted and verified with link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt[bcrypt^]
** Testing is performed using link:https://jestjs.io/[Jest^]

[NOTE]
.Node.js Version and Syntax Choices
====
For the sake of brevity, this course will use the ECMAScript `import` syntax as supported in the latest Node.js LTS version.
You may also use the `require` syntax if preferred.
For readability, the course will also use `async`/`await` syntax.

== Get Started

In the next lesson, we will walk through the prerequisites, clone the project and start the server.
