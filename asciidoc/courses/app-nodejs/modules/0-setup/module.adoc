= Project Introduction
:order: 0

As part of this course, you will work on a link:https://github.com/{repository}[pre-built repository^] for the fictional client **Neoflix**.
The course is designed to be framework agnostic, so although we have chosen a specific framework, the tasks that you will perform will be the same regardless of your choice of framework.

In the early stages you will learn some of the theory required and then use that knowledge to implement a set of features in the API.

== Repository Information

We have built a repository that takes care of the boiler plate, so you can focus on implementing the functionality.

* The project is designed to work with Node.js version **16.15.1**
* Packages can be installed with either NPM or Yarn
* A web server has been built with link:https://expressjs.com/[Express^]
** Authentication is handled with link:https://www.passportjs.org/[passport^] and link:https://jwt.io/[JWT Tokens^]
** Passwords are encrypted and verified with link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt[bcrypt^]
** Testing is performed using link:https://jestjs.io/[Jest^]


[NOTE]
.Node.js Version and Syntax Choices
====
For the sake of brevity, this course will use the ECMAScript `import` syntax as supported in the latest Node.js LTS version.
You may also use the `require` syntax if preferred.
For readability, the course will also use `async`/`await` syntax.
