= Rating Movies
:type: challenge
:branch: 06-rating-movies
:test-number: 06

The challenges in this course come thick and fast!

In this challenge, you will modify the `add()` method in the link:{repository-blob}main/src/routes/rating.service.js[`RatingService`^] to save ratings into Neo4j.
As part of the challenge, you will:

1. <<Convert the Rating>>
2. <<Save the Rating in a Write Transaction>>
3. <<Return the Results>>


== The Request Lifecycle

image::images/rating-form.png[Rating a Movie, role=right]

Before we start, let's take a look at the request lifecycle when saving a review.
If you prefer, you can skip to <<Saving a Rating>>.

On every Movie page, the user is invited to rate a movie on scale of 1 to 5.
The form pictured to the right gives the user the ability to select a rating between 1 and 5 and click submit to save the rating.

When the form is submitted, the website sends a request to `/api/account/ratings/{movieId}` and the following will happen:

1. The server directs the request to the route handler in link:{repository-blob}main/src/routes/account.routes.js[`src/routes/account.routes.js`^], which verifies the user's JWT token before handling the request.
2. The route handler creates an instance of the link:{repository-blob}main/src/services/rating.service.js[`RatingService`^].
3. The `add()` method is called on the `RatingService`, and is passed the ID of the current user plus the ID of the movie and a rating from the request body.
4. It is then the responsibility of the `add()` method to save this information to the database and return an appropriate response.

A rating is represented in the graph a relationship going from a `:User` to a `:Movie` node with the type `:RATED`.  The relationship has two properties; the rating (an integer) and a timestamp to represent when the relationship was created.

After the data is saved, the UI expects the movie details to be returned, with an additional property called `rating`, which will be the rating that the user has given for the movie.

Let's take a look at the existing method in the `RatingService`.

Your challenge is to replace the `TODO` comments in this method with working code.


== Saving a Rating

If you take the the comments one-by-one, you will need to convert the native integer into a Neo4j Integer, save the rating in the database and then return movie details and a rating.

=== Convert the Rating

To convert the native JavaScript integer to a Neo4j Integer, we can use the `int()` function exported from `neo4j-driver`.

[source,js]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/integers.js[tag=import]

// ...

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/services/rating.service.js[tag=convert,indent=0]
----

[TIP]
====
We could also use the `toInteger()` function in Cypher to convert the value sent by the driver.

[source,cypher,rel=norun]
toInteger(20.0) // 20

=== Save the Rating in a Write Transaction

For this part of the challenge, open a new session, execute the query within a _write_ transaction and close the session.

[source,js]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/services/rating.service.js[tag=write,indent=0]
----

[TIP]
By using the `MERGE` keyword here, we will overwrite an existing rating if one already exists.
This way we don't need to worry about duplicates or deleting existing records.


If either the `User` or `Movie` could not be found, throw a `NotFoundError`.

=== Return the Results

Finally, take the first row of the results and use the `get()` function to get the `movie` object returned by the query.
Use the `toNativeTypes()` function to convert any non-native types into their JavaScript equivalent.

[source,js]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/services/rating.service.js[tag=addreturn,indent=0]

[TIP]
This example uses the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment[Destructuring assignment^] technique to get the first record from the `res.records` array.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you have updated the `RatingService` to save a relationship between a User and Movie to represent a Rating.
You have also explicitly converted a JavaScript integer into a Neo4j Integer using the `int()` function.

In the next Challenge, you will implement the My Favorites feature.
