= Processing Results
:type: lesson
:order: 2

The Neo4j JavaScript Driver provides you with two APIs for consuming results:

* **Promise** API
* **Streaming** API


== The Promise API

The most common method of consuming results is with the Promise API.

When using `session.run()`, `tx.run()`, or one of the two transaction functions, the query will return a Promise.

Once the query has finished with all results results streamed to the Driver, the method resolves with a **Result** object.

.Using async/await
====
Here is an example query call using `async`/`await`.

.Async Example
[source,js,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/async-promises.js[tag=async]
----

By using the `await` keyword, the Result object is assigned to the `res` variable once the database has stopped streaming records to the Driver.

.Using Promises
====
Here is an example query utilizing the `then()` function from the returned Promise.

Once the database has stopped streaming records to the Driver, the Promise will resolve with a Result object.

== The Result

The **Result** object, defined as `res` in the examples above, contains the total number of records received by the Driver along with a set of additional meta data about the query.

An individual row of results is referred to as a `record`, and can be accessed by the `res.records` array.
A record refers to the keyed set of values specified in the `RETURN` portion of the statement.
If no `RETURN` values are specified, the query will not return any results, and as a result `res.records` will be an empty array.

The meta data included in the Result include statistics on how many nodes and relationships were created, updated, or deleted as a result of the query.

=== Records

You can access the records returned by the query through the `records` property.
This property is a native JavaScript array which can be iterated over, for example using the `.map()` or `.foreach()` methods.

[TIP]
.Key or Index
You can either access a value within the record by using the alias as specified in the `RETURN` portion of the Cypher statement or by specifing the column number as an integer.
The available keys can be accessed through `res.keys()`.

You can also iterate over a result within a `for` loop.

=== Result Summary

You can access summary information about the query through the `summary` property.
Included in this summary is information about the server, the query, execution times, and a `counters` object which provide statistics about the query.

For example, to get information about how long the query took to complete, you can use the following property:

.Using the Result Summary
[source,js,role=nocopy]
----
// Time in milliseconds before receiving the first result
console.log(res.summary.resultAvailableAfter) // 10

// Time in milliseconds once the final result was consumed
console.log(res.summary.resultConsumedAfter) // 30
----

Another interesting part of the summary is the `counters` property, which holds numerical data about the queries execution.
To access statistics as a result of a Write Transaction, you can call the `updates()` method on the `counters` property:

.Result Counters
[source,js,role=nocopy]
----
console.log(res.summary.counters.updates())

/*
{
  nodesCreated: 10,
  nodesDeleted: 0,
  relationshipsCreated: 5,
  relationshipsDeleted: 0,
  propertiesSet: 20,
  labelsAdded: 10,
  labelsRemoved: 0,
  indexesAdded: 0,
  indexesRemoved: 0,
  constraintsAdded: 0,
  constraintsRemoved: 0
}
*/

== The Streaming API

The drawback to the Promise API method of consuming results, is that the Promise will only resolve after all results have been received by the Driver.

There may be occasions where you have more complex, or slower-running queries in your application but wish to update a front-end application as results become available.
For example, many Flight search websites have complex queries that take up to a minute to complete, but simple, more expensive flights may be available immediately.

In this case, you can use the `subscribe()` method to consume results as they become available.
This method can be used when calling `session.run()` or `tx.run()` within a transaction function.

You can use this method with websockets, or a similar technology to update the front-end application with new results as they are made available.


The `subscribe()` method accepts one argument, an object of callbacks:

* `onKeys` - is called when keys are made available for all records.
* `onNext` - called when the next record is available.
* `onError` - called if an error is thrown.
* `onCompleted` - called when all records have been consumed and no error has been thrown.

[TIP]
.Reactive Streams with RxJS
====
The Drivers also offer out-of-the-box support for RxJS streams.
To create a reactive session, call the `rxSession()` method on the driver.

The execution of the query is almost identical, with the exception of a `records()` method which returns an RxJS `Observable`, to which you can apply operators.
