= Verifying the Test

This test creates a new `:User` node in the database with an email address of `authenticated@neo4j.com` using the `register()` method on the `AuthService` and then attempts to verify the user using the `authenticate` method.

Hit the **Check Database** button below to verify that the test has been successfully run.

.Hint
====
At the end of the test, a piece of code finds the User node and sets the `authenticatedAt` property to the current date and time using the Cypher `datetime()` function.
As long as this value is within the past 24 hours, the test should pass.

You can run the following query to check for the user within the database.
If the `shouldVerify` value returns true, the verification should be successful.

.Solution
====
The following statement will mimic the behaviour of the test, merging a new `:User` node with the email address `authenticated@neo4j.com`,  assigning a random UUID value to the `.userId` property and setting an `.authenticatedAt` property to the current date and time.
