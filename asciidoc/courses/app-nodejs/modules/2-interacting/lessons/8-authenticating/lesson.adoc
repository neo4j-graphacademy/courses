= Authenticating a User
:type: challenge
:order: 8

:lab: {repository-blob}/{previous-branch}/src/services/auth.service.js

At stage of the project,  a user can register, but they are still unable to sign in.
As with the previous Challenge, the `authenticate()` method is currently hard coded to accept only the email `graphacademy@neo4j.com` and password `letmein`.

In this challenge you will rewrite the `authenticate()` function of the link:./lab/[`AuthService`^] to find the User node with the corresponding email and compare the password before issuing a JWT token.


But first, let's take a look at how Authentication works in the application.
If you prefer, you can skip straight to <<Implementing Authentication>>.

== Passport & Authentication

This project uses a _Local Strategy_ exported from the `passport-local` library to handle the authentication request.
The purpose of a Local Strategy is to authenticate a user using a username and password.

When a user submits the Sign In form from the UI, the following process occurs:

1. A route handler in link:{repository-blob}/main/src/routes/auth.routes.js[`src/routes/auth.routes.js`^] listens for a `POST` request.
2. The `passport.authenticate` middleware triggers the _local_ authentication strategy.
3. This calls the callback function defined in link:{repository-blob}/main/src/passport/neo4j.strategy.js[`src/passport/neo4j.strategy.js`^].
4. The strategy creates a new instance of the link:{repository-blob}/main/src/routes/auth.service.js[`AuthService`^] and calls the `authenticate()` method with the username and password defined in the request.


The `authenticate()` method performs the following actions:

1. Attempt to find the user by their email address.
2. If the user does not exist, return `false`.
3. Compare the encrypted password in the database against the unencrypted password sent with the request.
4. If the passwords do not match, return `false`.
5. Otherwise, return an object containing the user's _safe_ properties, and a JWT token with a set of claims that can be used in the UI.


For this strategy to work correctly, the `authenticate()` method must return an object which represents the user on successful login, or return `false` if the credentials are incorrect.

If the returned value is anything other than false, the value will be appended to the request, and will be accessible through `req.user` on any route handlers that use the `passport.authenticate` middleware.


== Implementing Authentication

To implement database authentication, you will modify the `authenticate` method in the `AuthService`.

.src/services/auth.service.js
[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/services/auth.service.js[tag=authenticate]
----

Your challenge is to update the `authenticate()` method to perform the following actions:

1. <<Open a new Session>>
2. <<Find the User node within a Read Transaction>>
3. <<Close the Session>>
4. <<Verify The User Exists>>
5. <<Compare Passwords>>
6. <<Return User Details>>

Open `src/services/auth.service.js`

=== Open a new Session

First, open a new session:

[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.js[tag=session]
----


=== Find the User node within a Read Transaction

Use a `MATCH` query to find a `:User` node with the email address passed to the method as a parameter.

[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/services/auth.service.js[tag="query"]
----

=== Close the Session

Because the results have already been consumed by the driver, and no more interactions with the database will take place, the session can now be closed.

[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.js[tag="session.close"]
----


=== Verify The User Exists

If no records are returned, you can safely assume that the user does not exist in the database.
In this case, a `false` value should be returned.

[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/services/auth.service.js[tag="norecords"]
----


=== Compare Passwords

Next, you must verify that the unencrypted password matches the encrypted password saved as a property against the `:User` node.

The `bcrypt` library used to encrypt the password also includes a `compare()` function that can be used to compare a string against a previously encrypted value.

If the `compare()` function returns false, the passwords do not match and the method should also return false

[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/services/auth.service.js[tag="password"]
----

=== Return User Details

As with the `register()` method, the UI expects a JWT token to be returned along with the response.

The code is already written to the example, so this can be re-purposed at the end of the method.

[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/services/auth.service.js[tag="return"]

Once you have applied these changes to the `authenticate()` method, scroll to <<Testing>> to verify that the method works as expected.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you have updated the `AuthService` to authenticate a User using the data held in the Sandbox database.

In the next Challenge, you will write ratings to the database and learn how to use the `int()` function to save JavaScript integers in Neo4j.
