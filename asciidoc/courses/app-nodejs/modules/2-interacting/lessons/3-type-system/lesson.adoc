= The Neo4j Type System
:type: quiz
:order: 3

At this point, we look at the Cypher type system.
As Neo4j is written in Java (the _j_ in Neo4**j** stands for Java after all), there are some discrepencies between the types stored in the Neo4j database and native JavaScript types.

Some values like strings, floats, booleans, and nulls have a direct mapping to JavaScript types but more complex types need special handling.

Let's take a look at some of these types in more detail.



== Integers

Due to a discrepancy between integers in JavaScript and in the Neo4j type system, we need to take extra care when working with integers in the Neo4j JavaScript Driver.

The Neo4j type system uses 64-bit signed integer values (with a range of `-(2^64^- 1)` and `(2^63^- 1)`) while JavaScript can only safely represent integers between `-(2^53^- 1)` (`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`) and `2^53^- 1` (`and Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`).

In order to conform with the Neo4j type system, the driver will not automatically convert to JavaScript integers. It will convert them to a Float.  This ensures that no data is lost.

The driver provides an `Integer` type, and an `int()` function for sending and receiving integers with neo4j.

When an integer is received by the driver, it is wrapped in an `Integer` class.
You can call the `toNumber()` method on this object to convert it back into a JavaScript number.
If the number is outside of the valid range, it will be returned as a string.

.Working with Integers

----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=integers]
----

We make use of these functions often throughout this course.



== Nodes & Relationships

Nodes and Relationships are both returned as similar classes.

As an example, let's take the following code snippet:

.Return Nodes and Relationships
[source,js,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=run]

include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=row]
----

The query will return one `row` for each `:Person` and `:Movie` node with an `:ACTED_IN` relationship between them.

=== Nodes

We can retrieve the `movie` value using the `.get()` method on the row.

[source,js,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=get]
----

The value assigned to the `person` variable will be the instance of a `Node`.
Node is a type provided by the Neo4j JavaScript Driver to hold the information held in Neo4j for the node.

An instance of a `Node` has three properties:

.Working with Node Objects
[source,js,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=node]
----

1. `identity` - a Neo4j `Integer` representing the internal ID for the node. +
    eg. `Integer {high: 1234, low: 0}`
2. `labels` - an Array of String values, one per label stored against the node. +
    eg. `['Person', 'Actor']`
3. `properties` - A JavaScript object containing all the properties for the node. +
    eg. `{name: 'Tom Hanks', tmdbId: '31' }`


[TIP]
.Internal IDs
Internal IDs refer to the position in the Neo4j store files where the record is held.
These numbers can be re-used, a best practice is to always look up a node by an indexed property rather than relying on an internal ID.

=== Relationships

`Relationship` objects are similar to `Node` in that they also include a `identity` and `properties` properties.


.Working with Relationship Objects
[source,js,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=rel]
----


1. `identity` - a Neo4j `Integer` representing the internal ID for the relationship. +
    eg. `Integer {high: 9876, low: 0}`
2. `type` - the type of the relationship +
    eg. `ACTED_IN`
3. `properties` - A JavaScript object containing all the properties for the node. +
    eg. `{role: 'Woody' }`
4. `start` - a Neo4j `Integer` representing the internal ID for the node at the start of the relationship
5. `end` - a Neo4j `Integer` representing the internal ID for the node at the end of the relationship


=== Paths

If you return a path of nodes and relationships, they will be returned as an instance of a `Path`.

.Working with Path Objects
[source,js,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=path]
----

1. `start` - a Neo4j `Integer` representing the internal ID for the node at the start of the path
2.  `end` - a Neo4j `Integer` representing the internal ID for the node at the end of the path
3. `length` - A count of the number of _segments_ within the path
4. `segments` - An array of `PathSegment` objects.

==== Path Segments

A path is split into segments representing each relationship in the path.
For example, say we have a path of `(p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)`, there would be two segments.

1. `(p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)`
2. `(m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)`

.Iterating over Segments
[source,js,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=segments]
----

The `PathSegment` object has three properties:

* `relationship` - A `Relationship` object representing that part of the path.
* `start` - The internal ID for the start node for this path segment `*`
* `end` -  ID for the end node for this path segment `*`

[TIP]
.`*` Start and End nodes within the Path Segment object
The start and end nodes on the `PathSegment` may differ from the start and end nodes of the relationship itself if the relationship was traversed in reverse direction.


== Temporal Types

The Temporal types used in the Cypher type system mean that they are also handled differently.
The driver exports helper functions to assist in checking the type.

.Temporal Types
[cols="1,3,1,1"]
|===
| Neo4j Cypher Type | Description | Example | Helper Function

| `Date`
| Represents an instant capturing the date, but not the time, nor the timezone.
| `2020-01-02`
| `isDate`

| `DateTime`
| Represents an instant capturing the date, the time and the timezone identifier.
| `2020-01-02T01:02:03+04:00`
| `isDateTime`


| `LocalDateTime`
| Represents an instant capturing the date and the time, but not the timezone.
| `2020-01-02T01:02:03+04:00`
| `isLocalDateTime`

| `LocalTime`
| Represents an instant capturing the time of day, but not the date, nor the timezone.
| `12:34:56`
| `isLocalDate`

| `Time`
| Represents an instant capturing the time of day, and the timezone offset in seconds, but not the date.
| `12:34:56+04:00`
| `isTime`

|===


Each of these types has a `toString()` method that can be used in conjunction with `Date.parse()` in JavaScript to convert the Cypher date into a native `Date` object.


.Working with Temporal types
[source,js,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.js[tag=temporal]
----

== Spatial Types

Cypher has built-in support for handling spatial values (points), and the underlying database supports storing these point values as properties on nodes and relationships.


=== Point

When using the `Point` spatial type, regardless of the coordinate reference system, an instance of the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/spatial-types.js~Point.html[`Point`^] is returned.
The `Point` object has three public members:

* `srid` - The coordinate reference system (CRS) identifier (`4326` for the `wsg-84` or `wsg-84-3d` CRS).
* `x` - The x coordinate of the point.
* `y` - The y coordinate of the point.
* `z` - The z coordinate of the point or undefined if point is 2-dimensional.

The `isPoint()` helper function will allow you to check whether a variable is an instance of a `Point`

.Working with Points
[source,js]
----
import { Point, isPoint } from 'neo4j-driver'

const london = new Point(-0.118092, 51.509865)
const shard = new Point(-0.086500, 51.504501, 310) // 310m high

const cartesian2d = new Point(10, 5)
const cartesian3d = new Point(10, 5, 20)

console.log(london) // Point({srid:4326, x:-0.118092, y:51.509865})
console.log(shard) // Point({srid:4979, x:-0.0865, y:51.504501, z:310})

console.log(catesian2d) // Point({srid:7203, x:5, y:10})
console.log(catesian3d) // Point({srid:9157, x:5, y:10, z:20})

console.log(isPoint(london)) // true
console.log(isPoint('string')) // false
----

[WARNING]
.`x`, `y` and `z`
====
Regardless of the `srid` or whether the point is created using `latitude`, `longitude` (and `height`), the object returned by the Driver will *always* contain `x`, `y` and `z` properties.

When using `wsg-84` or `wsg-84-3d` coordinates, `x` will represent `longitude`, `y` will represent `latitude` and `z` will represent the height.
====

=== Distance

When using the `distance()` function in Cypher, the distance calculated between two points is returned as a float.


[source,cypher]
----
WITH point({x: 1, y:1}) AS one,
     point({x: 10, y: 10}) AS two

RETURN distance(one, two) // 12.727922061357855
----


== Converting these values en masse

There may be times when you need to convert many Neo4j types back into native JavaScript types.
For example, when retrieving a set of properties.

For this purpose, We have added a utility function to `src/utils.js` which when given an Object of properties, will iterate through the keys and where appropriate convert the value to a native JavaScript value.
This function is called `toNativeTypes()`.

[%collapsible]
.Show the `toNativeTypes()` method
====
This function checks for both integer and temporal values as mentioned in the previous section, and calls the appropriate method to convert them into a more friendly format.

.src/utils.js
[source,js,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/utils.js[tag=toNativeTypes]

The function is recursive, and will handle nested objects and arrays.

In this lesson you have learned how to handle some of the more complex objects returned by a Cypher query.

As we progress through this module, you will use the knowledge gained so far to read data from, and write data back to the database.
In the next Challenge, you will modify the repository to read from the database.
