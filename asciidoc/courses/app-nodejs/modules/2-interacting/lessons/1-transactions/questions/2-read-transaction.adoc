= 2. Reading from the Database

Say we want to create a new transaction that reads data from a Neo4j database.  We want any queries from this method to be distributed across the cluster.

Use the dropdown in the code block below to select the correct method.

[source,js,rel=nocopy]
----
const res = await session./*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(tx => {
    // Use tx.run to read from the database
})
----

- [ ] read
- [ ] readQuery
- [*] executeRead
- [ ] executeWrite
