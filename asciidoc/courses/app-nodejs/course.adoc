== Course Description

In this course, we walk through the steps to integrate Neo4j into your Node.js projects.

We will follow the steps to create an instance of the Neo4j JavaScript Driver, learn how to use sessions and transactions, and use that knowledge to replace hardcoded API responses with data from a Neo4j Sandbox instance.

The project also serves a pre-built Single Page Application (SPA) that calls the API.
As you work through the course, you will replace the hardcoded API responses with data from Neo4j.

The course automatically creates a new `recommendations` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.


We also offer the abridged link:/courses/app-typescript/[Building Neo4j Applications with TypeScript] course that teaches you link:/courses/app-typescript/[how to use the type-checking features of the Neo4j JavaScript driver^].


=== Prerequisites

By taking this course, we assume you have a working knowledge of JavaScript, NPM and the Node.js ecosystem.
We also assume that you have at least a basic understanding of Neo4j.

If you haven't already done so, we recommend that you also take the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals] course to gain a basic understanding of Neo4j and the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals] to understand how to query Neo4j using Cypher.
