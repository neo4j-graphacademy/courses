== Using WITH for map projection to limit results

Here is a query, a version of which  you saw in the previous lesson:

[source,cypher,role=partial]
----
MATCH (n:Movie)
WHERE n.imdbRating IS NOT NULL and n.poster IS NOT NULL
// Add WITH clause to return custom data for each movie
ORDER BY n.imdbRating DESC LIMIT 4
RETURN collect(n)
----

Modify this query by adding a WITH clause that customizes the data returned for each Movie node to include:

* title
* imdbRating
* List of actor names
* List of Genre names

Then answer this  question:

== Summary

In this challenge, you wrote a query to use a `WITH` clause to return a subset of data using map projection.

In the next challenge, you will answer another question about the graph.
