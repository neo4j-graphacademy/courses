== Using UNWIND

You have learned that in a query, you can create lists of nodes, strings, or numbers using collect().
Sometimes it is useful to collect elements as intermediate results that are passed on to a later part of a query.
For example, the graph  you are working with contains languages and countries lists for each Movie node.
If you wanted to refactor the graph to create a Language node and associate it with any Movie node that had that particular language in its languages list,
you could unwind the list to access each element in the list.

`UNWIND` returns a row for each element of a list.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Actor)
WHERE a.name = 'Tom Hanks'
UNWIND m.languages AS lang
RETURN m.title AS movie,
m.languages AS languages,
lang AS language
----

In this query:

. A Movie is retrieved that Tom Hanks acted in.
. The languages property, which is a list is unwound and each value is referenced as lang.
. The rows returned will be the movie title and the languages property repeated for multiple rows and the lang value.

In this code,  you could imagine that you could create a Language node with a name property which is lang.

Let's now look at a more useful example.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
UNWIND m.languages AS lang
WITH m, trim(lang) AS language
// this automatically, makes the language distinct because it's a grouping key
WITH language, collect(m.title) AS movies
RETURN language, movies[0..10]

----

This query:

. Retrieves all Movie nodes.
. For each Movie node, it unwinds the languages list to create a list called lang. Notice  that we use the trim() function to ensure there are no extraneous whitespace characters in the language name.
. Then  we use the element of the list to find all Movies that use that language.
. Finally, we return a row that contains each language name and the list of up to 10 movie titles for that language.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how  `UNWIND` can be used to create intermediate results that can be used for pipelining queries.

In the next challenge, you will modify a query that uses `UNWIND`.
