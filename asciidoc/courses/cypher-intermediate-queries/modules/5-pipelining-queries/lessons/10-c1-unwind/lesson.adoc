== Using UNWIND pass on intermediate results

You have already seen this query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
UNWIND m.languages AS lang
WITH m, trim(lang) AS language
// this automatically, makes the language distinct because it's a grouping key
WITH language, collect(m.title) AS movies
RETURN language, movies[0..10]
----

Modify this query to return the number of movies released in each country.

Then answer this question:
