== Map projections

Many applications that access Neo4j via their drivers use Cypher to retrieve data from the graph as objects that will be used by the application.
In Neo4j Browser, when nodes are returned, you can either view them as a graph, or you can view them in table view where all properties for a node  are a single row.
The data is returned as rows of data where each row represents a JSON-style object for a node.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS "Thomas"
RETURN p AS person ORDER BY p.name ASC
----

This query returns all Person nodes that contain the string "Thomas".
If you view the data returned as a table, it returns internal node information such as labels and identity, along with the property values.

Another way that you can return data is without the internal node information, that is, only property values.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS "Thomas"
RETURN p { .* } AS person
ORDER BY p.name ASC
----

This query returns an object named person that contains all of the property values for the node.
It does not contain any of the internal information for the node such as its labels or id.

Additionally, you can customize what properties you return in the objects.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS "Thomas"
RETURN p { .name, .born } AS person
ORDER BY p.name
----

Here the person objects returned will include the name and born properties.

Being able to customize how data is returned is useful, especially if you are using a programming language that can work with JSON-style objects.

Here is an example, where we are adding information to the objects returned that are not part of the data in the graph.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Director)
WHERE d.name = 'Woody Allen'
RETURN m {.*, favorite: true} AS Movie
----

In addition to returning all property values for each Woody Allen movie, we are returning a property of favorite with a value of true for each Movie object returned.
