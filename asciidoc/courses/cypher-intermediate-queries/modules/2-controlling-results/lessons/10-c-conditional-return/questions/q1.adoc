.Hint
====
The syntax for a `CASE` clause is:

[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
CASE
WHEN [condition] THEN result
WHEN [condition] THEN result
ELSE result
END
----

The `[condition]` should test whether the `runtime` property is less than (`<`) or greater than or equal to (`>=`) 120.

The `result` should be either "Short" or "Long".
