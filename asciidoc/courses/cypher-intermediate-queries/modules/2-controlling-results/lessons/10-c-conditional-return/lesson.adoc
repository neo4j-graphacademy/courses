== Conditionally returning values for rows

Here is a query that returns the movies that Charlie Chaplin has acted in and the runtime for the movie.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Charlie Chaplin'
RETURN m.title AS movie,
// Add CASE clause code here
m.runtime AS runTime
----

Modify this query to return "Short" for runTime if the movie's runtime is < 120 (minutes)
and "Long" for runTime if the movie's runtime is >= 120.

Then answer this  question:
