This lesson is intended to give you a very brief view of how a few of the programming languages that Neo4j supports uses Cypher with parameters.

Although each language has its own distinct syntax, the process for each language is similar.
Parameters are sent as an additional argument when a Cypher statement is run through the driver, and are referenced in the same way as covered in this module, by applying the `$` prefix.

== Example: Java

Here is a code snippet that illustrates the use of parameters in Java:

[source,java]
----
try (var session = driver.session()) {
  Result res = session.readTransaction(tx -> tx.run("""
    MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
    WHERE m.title = $title
    RETURN p
    LIMIT 10
  """, Values.parameters("title", "Toy Story")));
}
----

In this example, the parameters are passed to the second argument of the `tx.run` method using the static `parameters` function provided by the `org.neo4j.driver.Values` class.

== Example: JavaScript

Here is a code snippet that illustrates the use of parameters in JavaScript:

[source,js]
----
const session = driver.session()
const res = await session.readTransaction(tx =>
  tx.run(`
    MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
    WHERE m.title = $title
    RETURN p
    LIMIT 10
  `,
  { title: 'Toy Story'})
)
----

In this example, the parameters are passed to the second argument of the `tx.run` method as a JavaScript object.

== Example: Python

Here is a code snippet that illustrates the use of parameters in Python:

[source,python]
----
def get_actors(tx, movieTitle): # (1)
  result = tx.run("""
    MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
    WHERE m.title = $title
    RETURN p
  """, title=movieTitle)

  # Access the `p` value from each record
  return [ record["p"] for record in result ]

with driver.session() as session:
    result = session.read_transaction(get_actors, movieTitle="Toy Story")
----

In Python, Cypher parameters are passed as named parameters to the `tx.run` method.
In this example, `title` has been passed as a named parameter.
