In the previous challenge, you learned how to set a parameter.

In this challenge, you will need to create to create multiple parameters to run this query:

----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH $name
AND $country IN m.countries
RETURN p.name AS actor,
m.title AS title
----

If you run this query without setting any parameters, you will receive an error:

----

To complete this challenge, complete the following steps:

. Set the [copy]#name# parameter to [copy]#Tom#.
