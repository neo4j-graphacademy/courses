== Using multiple `MATCH` clauses

Here is an example of a query that contains two explicit `MATCH` clauses:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.year > 2000
MATCH (m)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person)
RETURN a.name, m.title, d.name
----

This query:

. Retrieves the anchor nodes (movies released after the year 2000) and the set of actors for each movie.
. It then follows the `:DIRECTED` relationships to each Movie node to retrieve the director of each movie.
. It returns the triple of actor name, movie title, director name.

Notice that actors, movie titles, directors are repeated in the rows returned.

=== Using multiple patterns in the `MATCH` clause

An alternative to using multiple `MATCH` clauses is to specify multiple patterns:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie),
      (m)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person)
WHERE m.year > 2000
RETURN a.name, m.title, d.name
----

In this query, multiple patterns are specified. In the second pattern, the variable m is used from the first pattern.

In general, using a single `MATCH` clause will perform better than multiple `MATCH` clauses.
This is because relationship uniqueness is enforced so there are fewer relationships traversed.

=== Using a single pattern

And finally, the same query can be written as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person)
WHERE m.year > 2000
RETURN a.name, m.title, d.name
----

In most cases, specifying a single pattern will yield the best performance.

The performance of your queries will depend greatly upon your data model and the size of the graph.

=== Optionally matching rows

Cypher has a clause that allows you to return rows that contain null values for some properties.

Here is an example of a query that we will start with:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.title = "Kiss Me Deadly"
MATCH (m)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)<-[:IN_GENRE]-(rec:Movie)
MATCH (m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(rec)
RETURN rec.title, a.name
----

In this query:

. We find the movie node for Kiss Me Deadly.
. Then we find all movies, rec that are in the same genre as Kiss Me Deadly.
. Then we find the actors that acted in both rec and Kiss Me Deadly.

The result is one actor who acted in both Kiss Me Deadly and The Killers.

What if we wanted to expand the results returned to return all movies that are in the same genre, and the actor that acted in both movies.

`OPTIONAL MATCH` matches patterns with your graph, just like `MATCH` does.
The difference is that if no matches are found, `OPTIONAL MATCH` will use nulls for missing parts of the pattern.
`OPTIONAL MATCH` could be considered the Cypher equivalent of the outer join in SQL.

Here is how you specify `OPTIONAL MATCH` in Cypher:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.title = "Kiss Me Deadly"
MATCH (m)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)<-[:IN_GENRE]-(rec:Movie)
OPTIONAL MATCH (m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(rec)
RETURN rec.title, a.name
----

This query returns rows where the pattern where an actor acted in both movies is optional and a null value is returned for any row that has no value.
In general, and depending on your graph, an optional match will return more rows.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned the difference between multiple match clauses and multiple match patterns in a query, as well as optional matches.

In the next challenge, you will have an opportunity to perform an optional match.
