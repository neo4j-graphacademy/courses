= Profiling a query

This query returns the movies that "Clint Eastwood" acted in but did *not* direct:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Clint Eastwood'
AND NOT exists {(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)}
RETURN m.title
----

You can profile the query to see the performance of the query by adding `PROFILE` to the beginning of the query.

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Clint Eastwood'
AND NOT exists {(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)}
RETURN m.title
----

The results breakdown the performance of the query into the components of the query.

Review the results.
Based on the `db hits`, which part of the query do you think is the most expensive?

* [ ] (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
* [ ] p.name = 'Clint Eastwood'
* [x] (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)

.Hint
====
Identify each part of the query using the description in the profile results.

The part with the highest `dh hits` is the most expensive.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is `(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)`.
This step has the highest number of db hits.

[NOTE]
You may see a different number of db hits if you have made updates to the database.
