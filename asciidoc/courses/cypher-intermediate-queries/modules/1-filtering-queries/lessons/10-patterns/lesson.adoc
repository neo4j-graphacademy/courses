== Patterns in the graph

The Neo4j graph engine is implemented to traverse relationships very quickly.
As you become more experienced with Cypher queries, you will soon learn that there are multiple ways to
 write a query that returns the same results.
The difference in queries is typically its traversal performance.
In this lesson, you will begin learning about graph traversal and query performance.

A pattern is a combination of nodes and relationships that is used to traverse the graph at runtime.
You can write queries that test whether a pattern exists in the graph.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE  p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
AND exists {(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)}
RETURN p.name, labels(p), m.title
----

This query:

. Retrieves the anchor of the query, the Tom Hanks `:Person` node.
. It then follows the `:ACTED_IN` relationship to a `:Movie` node.
. Then, for the Movie node and Person node, it tests whether these nodes are related by the DIRECTED relationship.
. If they are, then the row is returned.

This `exists { }` test is done for every Movie node related to Tom Hanks as an actor.
This query returns the single movie that Tom Hanks directed and acted in.

=== Profiling queries

You can use the `PROFILE` keyword to show the total number of rows retrieved from the graph in the query.

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE  p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
AND exists {(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)}
RETURN m.title
----

In the profile, you can see that the initial row is retrieved, but then 38 rows are retrieved for each Movie that
 Tom Hanks acted in.
Then the test is done for the `:DIRECTED` relationship.

This is a better way to do the same query. This is a query that you have seen before.

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p)
WHERE  p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN  m.title
----

The query:

. Retrieves the anchor (the Tom Hanks Person node).
. It then finds a Movie node where Tom Hanks is related to with the ACTED_IN relationship.
. It then traverses all DIRECTED relationships that point to the same Tom Hanks node.

This traversal is very efficient because the graph engine can take the [internal] relationship cardinalities
 into account.
If you execute this query, it returns the same result as the previous query; the movie title Larry Crowne.

Notice, however that this query is much more efficient. It retrieves one row then two rows; much less data than
 the first query.
Note that the performance of queries that use patterns will depend upon the data model for your graph and
 also the number of nodes in the traversal.

The difference between using `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` is that `EXPLAIN` provides estimates of the query
 steps where `PROFILE` provides the exact steps and number of rows retrieved for the query.
Providing you are simply querying the graph and not updating anything, it is fine to execute the
 query multiple times using `PROFILE`.
In fact, as part of query tuning, you should execute the query at least twice as the first execution
 involves the generation of the execution plan which is then cached.
That is, the first PROFILE of a query will always be more expensive than subsequent queries.

[NOTE]
--
Query tuning is beyond the scope of this course, but it is important to profile your queries so that
 you can optimize the queries of your application.
The metric that is typically a good measure of query performance is the number db hits.

=== Finding non-patterns

You've just seen that using a pattern and testing the existence of a pattern in our graph for this course
 is not optimal.
This may or may not be the case, depending on  your data model.
There is a scenario where using `exists { }` for a pattern is useful.
You use `NOT exists { }` to exclude patterns in the graph.

We want to find all the movies that Tom Hanks acted in, but did not direct.

Here is the best way to do this:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE  p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
AND NOT exists {(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)}
RETURN  m.title
----

Here we want to exclude the `:DIRECTED` relationships to movies for Tom Hanks.
If you profile this query, you will find that it is not performant, but it is the only way to perform this query.

== Summary

In this lesson, you began to learn about patterns in the graph and how to measure the performance of a query.

In the next challenge, you will write a query that uses exists { } to exclude part of the graph.
