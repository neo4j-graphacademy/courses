== Filtering with `WHERE`

In the course, link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^], you learned some basic querying where you use the `WHERE` clause to filter queries where you test equality.

=== Testing Equality

Execute this query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
AND m.year = 2013
RETURN m.title
----

In this query, we:

. Find all `:Person` nodes with the name, Tom Hanks.
. We then traverse the `:ACTED_IN` relationships to all `:Movie` nodes and filter for movies with a `year` property equal to 2013.
. Return the movie titles.

We are specifying the pattern to traverse through the graph, and then filtering on what data is retrieved within that pattern.
We then return the `title` property for the three movie titles that satisfy the query.

[NOTE]
--
Your queries will execute faster if the graph has indexes on property values.
This course does not cover creating indexes.
You typically create indexes for property values that cover your application's most important queries.

=== Testing Inequality

You can also test inequality of a property using the `<>` predicate.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name <> 'Tom Hanks'
AND m.title = 'Captain Phillips'
RETURN p.name
----


// DONE: Elaine, are the commas correct here?  "acted in the movie, Captain Phillips"
// took out comma
This query returns the names of all actors that acted in the movie Captain Phillips where Tom Hanks is excluded.
It returns the names of the three actors that satisfy the filtering criteria.


=== Testing less than or greater than

// DONE: Elaine, we should mention this before ranges
// took out WITH clause as they have not learned yet and modified the query

You can test both numbers and strings for values less than (`<`) or greater than (`>`) a value.
Adding the equals sign will include the specified number within the predicate.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
RETURN
    m.year < 1995 AS lessThan, //  Less than (false)
    m.year <= 1995 AS lessThanOrEqual, // Less than or equal(true)
    m.year > 1995 AS moreThan, // More than (false)
    m.year >= 1995 AS moreThanOrEqual // More than or equal (true)
----

=== Testing Ranges

// DONE: Elaine, rather than repeating "you can also...", can we instead explain the operators and/or process?first?

To test for property values within a range, you can use a combination of less than and greater than.

Here we test a range of values:

// reco db change impact
// video will need a redo

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
AND  2005 <= m.year <= 2010
RETURN m.title, m.released
----

This query returns the four movies that Tom Hanks acted in between 2005 and 2010, inclusive.

We can also use `OR` to expand the filtering to return more data as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
OR m.title = 'Captain Phillips'
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

This query returns rows containing the name and title. Each row represents an actor who acted in Captain Phillips or has the name of Tom Hanks.
In this result you will see multiple rows for Tom Hanks and each movie he acted in.
You will also see multiple rows for each of the actors who acted in the movie, Captain Phillips.

Later in this course you will learn how to group data that is returned so that there are not multiple rows for Tom Hanks or multiple rows for the movie, Captain Phillips.

=== Testing `null` property values

A property for a node or relationship is null if it does not exist.
You can test the existence of a property for a node using the `IS NOT NULL` predicate.

// reco db change impact
// results will look different in video

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.died IS NOT NULL
AND p.born.year >= 1985
RETURN p.name, p.born, p.died
----

This query returns the names, born, and died properties for all people who have a value for their died property and who were born after 1985.
In this graph, it returns 6 rows.

And we can test if a property exists using the `IS NULL` predicate:

// reco db change impact
// results will look different in video

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.died IS NULL
AND p.born.year <= 1922
RETURN p.name, p.born, p.died
----

This query returns all people born before 1923 who do not have a died property value.
It returns 21 rows for our dataset.

=== Testing labels or patterns?

Depending on your data model, it may be useful to test that a node has a label.
This is particularly useful when a node may have multiple labels.

You can test for a label's existence on a node using the `{alias}:{label}` syntax.

// reco db change impact
// results will look different in video


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE  p.born.year > 1960
AND p:Actor
AND p:Director
RETURN p.name, p.born, labels(p)
----

This query will retrieve all Person nodes with the label Actor and Director that were born after 1960.
The `labels()` function returns the list of labels for a node.
It returns 163 rows.

Here is a variation of the previous query.
Rather than using the Actor or Director labels, it uses the relationship types `:ACTED_IN` and `:DIRECTED` to imply that the node at the other end of the relationship has the correct label:

// reco db change impact
// results will look different in video

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p)
WHERE  p.born.year > 1960
RETURN p.name, p.born, labels(p), m.title
----

This query retrieves all people born after 1960 (assigned to the alias `p`), who also acted in a movie and directed the same movie.
This query is more specific in that the same person both directed and acted in the movie.
In the previous query, we were only looking at labels and not relationships to movies.
This query returns 134 rows, but notice that some people directed and acted in multiple movies, for example, Jodie Foster.

=== Discovering relationship types

A query with a pattern need not specify the relationship type in the query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r]->(m:Movie)
WHERE  p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN m.title AS movie, type(r) AS relationshipType
----

This query retrieves all Movie nodes that are related to Tom Hanks.
Each row returned is a movie title and the type of relationship that Tom Hanks has to that movie.
We use the `type()` function to return the type of the relationship, r.
Notice that for this query, Tom Hanks has both an ACTED_IN and DIRECTED relationship to the movie, Larry Crowne.

=== Testing list inclusion

You can test if a value is in a list property:

// reco db change impact
// video will show different results

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE "Israel" IN m.countries
RETURN m.title, m.languages, m.countries
----

This query returns the titles, languages, countries of all movies that have Israel in their list of countries.
// DONE: Elaine, I don't think we need to be so specific with the number of results?
// leave this commmented out: It returns 8 rows.
