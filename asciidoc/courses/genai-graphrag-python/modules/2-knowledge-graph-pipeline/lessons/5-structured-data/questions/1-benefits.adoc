= What are the benefits of adding structured data to a knowledge graph? (Select all that apply)

* [x] It enhances the knowledge graph's richness and usefulness by combining structured and unstructured data
* [x] It allows you to query the knowledge graph in new ways, such as finding lessons about specific technologies
* [ ] It automatically improves the accuracy of entity extraction from unstructured text
* [x] It enables you to summarize content by specific categories like technologies and concepts

Think about what new capabilities structured data adds to the knowledge graph - what can you do with the combination that you couldn't do with unstructured data alone?

.Solution
====
Adding structured data to a knowledge graph provides several benefits:

1. **Enhanced richness and usefulness** - Combining structured data (like CSV metadata) with unstructured data (extracted from documents) creates a more comprehensive knowledge graph
2. **New query capabilities** - You can find relationships between structured metadata and extracted entities, such as finding all lessons that cover specific technologies
3. **Content summarization** - You can group and summarize content by categories, connecting lesson metadata with extracted concepts and technologies

The incorrect option suggests that structured data improves entity extraction accuracy, but structured data doesn't directly affect the LLM's ability to extract entities from text - it provides additional context and relationships.
