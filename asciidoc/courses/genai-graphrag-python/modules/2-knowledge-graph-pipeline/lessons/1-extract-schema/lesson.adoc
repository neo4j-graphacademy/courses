:type: lesson
:order: 1


In this lesson you will review how a graph schema can be extract from text from an LLM.

Open 'todo - filename'

[source, python]

The code above uses the `SchemaFromTextExtractor` class to extract a schema from a given text input. 

The extractor:

. Create a prompt instructing the LLM to: 
.. Identify entities and relationships in any given text
.. Format the output as JSON 
. Passes the prompt and text to the LLM for processing
. Parses the JSON response to create a schema object

Given the text, _"Neo4j is a graph database management system (GDBMS) developed by Neo4j Inc."_, a simplified version of the extracted schema would be:

[source,text]
.Extracted Schema
----
node_types=(
    NodeType(label='GraphDatabase), 
    NodeType(label='Company')
) 
relationship_types=(
    RelationshipType(label='DEVELOPED_BY'),
) 
patterns=(
    ('GraphDatabaseManagementSystem', 'DEVELOPED_BY', 'Company')
) 
----

This schema can be used to stored the data held within the text.

Experiment with different text inputs to see how the schema extraction varies based on the content provided.
