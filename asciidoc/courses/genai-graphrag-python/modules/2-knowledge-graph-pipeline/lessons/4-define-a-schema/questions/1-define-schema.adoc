= Why would you define a schema when using the SimpleKGPipeline?

* [ ] To improve the performance and speed of data processing
* [ ] To reduce the computational resources required by the LLM
* [x] To create a more structured and meaningful knowledge graph by constraining entities and relationships
* [ ] To ensure that all possible entities and relationships are extracted from the text

Think about what happens when you don't provide a schema - the knowledge graph becomes unconstrained. What problems might this cause?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Defining a schema allows you to *create a more structured and meaningful knowledge graph by constraining the entities and relationships* that are extracted. Without a schema, the knowledge graph is unconstrained, meaning any entity or relationship can be created, which can lead to graphs that are non-specific and difficult to analyze and query.
