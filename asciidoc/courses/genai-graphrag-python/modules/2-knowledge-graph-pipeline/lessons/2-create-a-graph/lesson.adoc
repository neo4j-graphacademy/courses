Setup SimpleKGPipline

Load data and extract a graph using default.



In this lesson, you will learn how to create a knowledge graph from unstructured data using the `SimpleKGPipline`.

The `SimpleKGPipeline` class provides a pipeline which implements a series of steps to create a knowledge graph from unstructured data using typical default values for each step:

1. Load the text
2. Split the text into chunks
3. Create embeddings for each chunk
4. Extract entities from the chunks
5. Write the data to a Neo4j
