== Module Overview

The `SimpleKGPipeline` class is designed to be easily customizable to fit different use cases.
You can provide your own implementations for components in the pipeline, or use the existing components to generate your own pipelines.

In this optional module, you will learn how to modify the knowledge graph pipeline to suit your own use case, including:

* Creating custom data loaders.
* Implementing a chunking and text splitting strategy.
* Enhanced entity resolution.
* Using different LLMs and embedding models.
