= Splitting Text into Chunks
:type: lesson
:order: 2
:optional: true
:branch: new-course

You can modify how the `SimpleKGBuilder` splits text into chunks.
Your strategy for splitting text will impact the construction and how you search the knowledge graph.

In this lesson you will learn how to create a custom text splitter or integrate with an existing link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/[LangChain text splitter^].

== Custom Text Splitter

A custom text splitter allows you to define how the text is divided into chunks.

The PDF documents you have been using in this course contain sections, for example `= Heading` and `== Subheading`, that can be used to logically split the text into meaningful chunks.

You can create a custom text splitter by extending the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/api.html#textsplitter[`TextSplitter`^] class:

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-graphrag-python/examples/text_splitter_section.py[tag=import_splitter]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-graphrag-python/examples/text_splitter_section.py[tag=splitter]
----

The `SectionSplitter` class splits the text based on a section heading (`== `), then creates `TextChunk` objects for each section, and finally returns a `TextChunks` object containing all the chunks.

You can run the text splitter directly with test data to verify that it is working:

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-graphrag-python/examples/text_splitter_section.py[tag=run_splitter]

Your text splitter can then be used in the `SimpleKGPipeline` to split text into chunks by setting the `text_splitter` parameter:

== Integrate with LangChain Text Splitters

LangChain provides a variety of link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/[text splitters^] that you can use to implement different chunking strategies.

The `neo4j_graphrag` package includes a `LangChainTextSplitterAdapter` class that allows you to integrate LangChain text splitters with the `SimpleKGBuilder`.

You can use the https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.CharacterTextSplitter.html[LangChain `CharacterTextSplitter`^] to split text into paragraphs.

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-graphrag-python/examples/text_splitter_langchain.py[tag=splitter]
----

The `LangChainTextSplitterAdapter` wraps the LangChain `CharacterTextSplitter` to create text chunks.

The LangChain text splitter can then be used in the `SimpleKGPipeline` to split text into chunks by setting the `text_splitter` parameter:
