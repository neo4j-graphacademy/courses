= What are the steps taken by the GraphRAG pipeline when answering a question? (Select all that apply)

* [x] Perform a vector similarity search to find the most relevant chunks for a given query
* [x] Use a Cypher query to add additional information to the context
* [ ] Generate multiple embeddings for different interpretations of the user query
* [x] Pass the context to an LLM to generate a response to the original query

Think about the three main steps described in the lesson for how the VectorCypherRetriever and GraphRAG pipeline work together.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The GraphRAG pipeline follows these three main steps:

1. **Perform a vector similarity search** - Uses the vector index to find chunks most similar to the user's query
2. **Use a Cypher query to add additional information** - Executes a retrieval query to gather more context from the knowledge graph related to the found chunks
3. **Pass the context to an LLM** - Sends all the gathered context to the language model to generate a response to the original query

The incorrect option about "generating multiple embeddings for different interpretations" is not part of the described pipeline. The pipeline generates one embedding for the user query and uses it to find similar chunks, rather than creating multiple interpretations.
