= When would you use the Text2CypherRetriever in a GraphRAG pipeline?

* [ ] When you want to combine vector similarity with additional context from related graph nodes
* [x] When you want to get precise information from the knowledge graph using natural language questions
* [ ] When you need to validate and correct automatically generated Cypher queries before execution
* [ ] When you want to find semantically similar content across multiple document chunks

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Text2CypherRetriever is used when you want to get precise information from the knowledge graph using natural language questions. It generates and executes Cypher queries to answer specific questions like "How many lessons are in a course?", "What concepts are covered in a module?", or "How do technologies relate to each other?". This is different from vector retrieval, which finds similar content, or entity extraction, which processes raw documents.
