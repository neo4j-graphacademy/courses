= When would you use the Text2CypherRetriever in a GraphRAG pipeline?

* [ ] When you want to combine vector similarity with additional context from related graph nodes
* [x] When you want to get precise information from the knowledge graph using natural language questions
* [ ] When you need to validate and correct automatically generated Cypher queries before execution
* [ ] When you want to find semantically similar content across multiple document chunks

.Solution
====
**Text2CypherRetriever is used when you want to get precise information from the knowledge graph using natural language questions**. It generates and executes Cypher queries to answer specific questions like "How many lessons are in a course?", "What concepts are covered in a module?", or "How do technologies relate to each other?". This is different from vector retrieval, which finds similar content, or entity extraction, which processes raw documents.
