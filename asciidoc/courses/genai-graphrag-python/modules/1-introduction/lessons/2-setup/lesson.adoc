= Set up your development environment
:type: lesson
:order: 2
:branch: main


During this course, you will:

* Use the Neo4j link:https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/[GraphRAG for Python (`neo4j_graphrag`)^] package to create a knowledge graph from unstructured and structured data
* Create vector and text to Cypher retrievers that use the knowledge graph to provide context to an LLM

You must set up a development environment to run the code examples and exercises.

include::../../../../../../shared/courses/codespace/get-started.adoc[]

.Develop on your local machine
====
You will need link:https://python.org[Python^] installed and the ability to install packages using `pip`.

You may want to set up a virtual environment using link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[`venv`^] or link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[`virtualenv`^] to keep your dependencies separate from other projects.

Clone the link:{repository-link}[github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-graphrag-python^] repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-graphrag-python
----

Install the required packages using `pip`:

[source,bash]
----
cd genai-graphrag-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

You do not need to create a Neo4j database as you will use the provided sandbox instance.

The sandbox uses Neo4j's GenAI functions, you can find out more about how to configure them in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/[Neo4j GenAI integration documentation^].
====

== Setup the environment

Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`.
Fill in the required values.

[source]
.Create a .env file
----
# Create a copy of this file and name it .env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
NEO4J_URI="{instance-scheme}://{instance-ip}:{instance-boltPort}"
NEO4J_USERNAME="{instance-username}"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="{instance-password}"
NEO4J_DATABASE="{instance-database}"
----
// include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/.env.example[]

Add your Open AI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), which you can get from link:https://platform.openai.com[platform.openai.com^].

ifeval::[{course-completed}==true]

.Course completed
[IMPORTANT]
.Sandbox no longer available
====
You have completed this course.

The Neo4j sandbox instance is no longer available, you can create a Neo4j cloud instance using link:https://console.neo4j.io/graphacademy[Neo4j AuraDB^]
====

endif::[]



== Test your setup

You can test your setup by running `genai-graphrag-python/test_environment.py` - this will attempt to connect to the Neo4j sandbox and the OpenAI API.

[source,python]
.Test your setup
----
python genai-graphrag-python/test_environment.py
----

You will see an `OK` message if you have set up your environment correctly. If any tests fail, check the contents of the `.env` file.

== Continue

When you are ready, you can move on to the next task.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you prepared your development environment to build a knowledge graph.

In the next module, you will create a knowledge graph from unstructured and structured data using an LLM.
