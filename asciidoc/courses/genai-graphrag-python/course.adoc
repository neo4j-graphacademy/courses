== Course Description

In this hands-on course, you will learn how to create knowledge graphs using link:https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/[Neo4j GraphRAG for Python^].

You will:

* Use the `neo4j_graphrag` Python package to build knowledge graphs from unstructured data.
* Add structured data to the knowledge graph to improve LLM responses.
* Create retrievers to search the knowledge graph.
* Learn how you can customize the build process to suit your data and use case.

Finally, you will use what you have learned to build a knowledge graph from your data.

=== Prerequisites

This is an advanced course and you should:

* Understand graph and Neo4 fundamental concepts - link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals[Neo4j and Graph Fundamentals^].
* Have an understanding of how Generative AI, LLMs, and vector indexes are related to Neo4j - link:/courses/genai-fundamentals[Neo4j & GenerativeAI Fundamentals^].
* Be able to read and write simple Cypher queries - link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals[Cypher Fundamentals^].
* Understand how you can use an LLM to generate a knowledge graph - link:/courses/llm-knowledge-graph-construction[https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-knowledge-graph-construction/^].
* Have experience with programming in Python.
