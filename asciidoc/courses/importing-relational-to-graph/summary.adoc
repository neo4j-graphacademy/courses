Congratulations on completing "Importing Relational Data into Neo4j"!

You have migrated the Northwind relational data into a graph in Neo4j and can validate and query it with Cypher.

== Understanding Relational and Graph Models

You now know how to:

* Explain the fundamental differences between relational and graph data models
* Identify when a graph model fits your use case better than a relational one, such as traversal-heavy queries
* Describe the tools and prerequisites needed to migrate relational data into Neo4j

== Designing Your Graph Model from a Relational Schema

You have learned to:

* Analyze a relational database schema — tables, foreign keys, relationships — to plan a graph model
* Identify which tables become nodes and how foreign keys become relationships
* Map node labels and relationship types, and design properties for nodes and relationships
* Plan unique IDs, constraints, and indexes for data integrity and query performance
* Analyze relational schema structure (tables, keys, relationships) regardless of which database holds the data

== Importing Data with Neo4j Data Importer

You have mastered:

* Using the Neo4j Data Importer to create nodes from relational source data (CSV export or direct connection)
* Creating relationships between nodes and mapping source columns to graph properties
* Setting unique IDs so nodes and relationships are created correctly
* Handling NULL values, data type mismatches, and considerations for larger datasets
* Running a complete import of the Northwind dataset into a Neo4j Aura instance

== Validating and Querying Your Graph

You have learned how to:

* Create a test plan and run validation checks on imported data
* Verify data integrity — counts, key relationships — after migration
* Compare SQL JOIN queries with equivalent Cypher traversals
* Recognize when graph traversal queries outperform relational JOINs

== Pro Tips

=== Graph Model Design

* Map tables to nodes and foreign keys to relationships; avoid modeling every column as a node
* Use a single node label per entity type and one relationship type per semantic link
* Plan unique constraints and indexes on properties you will filter or join on before import
* Prefer a graph when your queries traverse multiple hops or variable-length paths

=== In the relational database before export

* Run referential integrity checks and fix orphaned or inconsistent foreign keys before export
* Deduplicate or normalize values you will use as unique identifiers, such as codes and names, so they map cleanly to nodes
* Document row counts and key relationships such as COUNT per table and sample JOINs so you can validate the same in Neo4j
* Export using a consistent character encoding such as UTF-8 and align date/numeric formats with what the importer expects
* Use a read-only or snapshot copy of the database for export to avoid changes during the export process

=== Data Preparation

* Export relational data to CSV or use a connector, and inspect for NULLs and encoding issues
* Decide how to represent NULLs in the graph — omit property, sentinel value, or separate node — before mapping
* Use stable, unique IDs from the source, such as primary keys, for node and relationship mapping in the importer
* For large datasets, test on a subset first and consider batching or bulk load tools if needed

=== Import and Validation

* Run the Data Importer in a test instance before targeting production
* Validate counts — nodes per label, relationships per type — and spot-check key relationships after import
* Compare a few critical SQL queries with equivalent Cypher to confirm semantics and performance
* Document your mapping — which table or column became which label, type, or property — for future reference

=== When to Choose Graph

* Use a graph for traversal-heavy, relationship-centric, or path-finding use cases
* Consider migration when JOINs become complex or query plans degrade in the relational system
* Keep relational for simple CRUD and reporting on flat tables; use graph where structure is the asset
