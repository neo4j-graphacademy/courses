== Course Description

Welcome to Importing Relational Data into Neo4j!

In this course, you will learn how to migrate data from relational databases into Neo4j. You will work with the classic Northwind PostgreSQL database and transform it into a graph data model optimized for traversal queries.

You will learn to:

* Understand the fundamental differences between relational and graph data models.
* Analyze relational database schemas to identify entities, relationships, and properties.
* Use PostgreSQL and Postico or pgAdmin to explore and query relational data.
* Transform relational tables into graph nodes and relationships.
* Use the Neo4j Data Importer to import relational data into a Neo4j Aura instance.
* Set unique IDs, constraints, and indexes to ensure data quality and query performance.

You will work hands-on with the Northwind database, a sample relational database representing a fictional company's sales data, and migrate it into a graph structure that you can query using Cypher.


=== Prerequisites

Before taking this course, you should have an understanding of:

* Graph and Neo4j fundamental concepts
* Basic Cypher queries
* Relational database concepts and SQL
* Graph data modeling principles

Completing the following courses in GraphAcademy is recommended:

* link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^]
* link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^]
* link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/modeling-fundamentals/[Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals^]

You will also need:

* A Neo4j database - choose one of:
** **AuraDB Professional** (recommended) - No credit card required, includes Graph Data Science support and Data Importer
** **GraphAcademy Sandbox** (quick start) - Free temporary sandbox provided with this course for learning
** **Self-managed Neo4j** - Neo4j Desktop or Docker installation
* PostgreSQL installed (link:https://postgresapp.com/[Postgres.app^] for macOS or link:https://www.postgresql.org/download/[postgresql.org^])
* Postico (macOS) or pgAdmin (Windows, Linux, macOS) - optional but recommended
* The Northwind database (instructions provided in the course)
