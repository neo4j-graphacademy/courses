== Course Description

This course teaches relational-to-graph migration concepts. You will learn how to migrate data from relational databases into Neo4j—the techniques apply to any relational source (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, or others).

You will learn to:

* Differentiate between relational and graph data models.
* Analyze relational database schemas to identify entities, relationships, and properties.
* Transform relational tables into graph nodes and relationships.
* Use the Neo4j Data Importer to ingest relational data into a Neo4j Aura instance.
* Set unique IDs, constraints, and indexes to ensure data quality and query performance.

You will work hands-on with the Northwind database, a sample relational database representing a fictional company's sales data, and migrate it into a graph structure that you can query using Cypher.
