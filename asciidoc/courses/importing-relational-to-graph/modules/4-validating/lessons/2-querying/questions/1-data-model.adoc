= SQL vs Cypher Performance

For which type of query does Cypher typically outperform SQL?

- [ ] Simple aggregations on a single table
- [ ] Bulk insert operations
- [x] Queries requiring 4 or more table JOINs
- [ ] Mathematical computations

Think about where graph traversal has an advantage over computing JOINs at query time.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Cypher outperforms SQL for queries requiring multiple JOINs** (4 or more tables).

Why?
* SQL JOINs are computed at query time, requiring index lookups for each join
* Cypher traversals follow pre-computed relationship pointers (constant time per hop)
* As JOIN count increases, SQL performance degrades while Cypher remains consistent

SQL may be faster for:
* Simple single-table aggregations (no traversal benefit)
* Bulk operations (mature optimization)
* Mathematical computations (more mature functions)
