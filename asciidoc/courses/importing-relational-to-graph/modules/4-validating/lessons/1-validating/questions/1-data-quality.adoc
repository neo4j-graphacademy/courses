= Validation Test Cases

Which of the following should be included in a data validation test plan after importing relational data into Neo4j? (Select all that apply)

- [x] Verify node counts match source table row counts
- [x] Check that relationship counts match expected foreign key connections
- [x] Validate that properties have correct data types
- [x] Test that unique constraints prevent duplicate creation
- [ ] Verify that all SQL queries still work unchanged

Think about what could go wrong during an import: missing data, wrong types, broken relationships, or duplicate records.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
A good validation plan should include:

* **Node count validation** - Ensures no data was lost or duplicated
* **Relationship count validation** - Verifies foreign keys were correctly converted to relationships
* **Property type validation** - Confirms data transformation was accurate (dates as dates, numbers as numbers)
* **Constraint testing** - Ensures data integrity rules are enforced

SQL queries will not work unchanged in Neo4j - you need to use Cypher instead.
