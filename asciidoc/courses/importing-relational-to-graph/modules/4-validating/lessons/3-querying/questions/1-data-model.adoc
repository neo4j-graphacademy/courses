= SQL and Cypher Performance

For which type of query does Cypher typically outperform SQL?

- [ ] Simple aggregations on a single table
- [ ] Bulk insert operations
- [x] Queries requiring 4 or more table JOINs
- [ ] Mathematical computations


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Cypher follows relationship pointers in constant time per hop; SQL JOINs are computed at query time and cost increases as more tables are joined. Multi-hop or multi-table JOIN queries are where graphs excel.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Cypher outperforms SQL for queries requiring multiple JOINs**, typically 4 or more tables.

Why?
* SQL JOINs are computed at query time, requiring index lookups for each join
* Cypher traversals follow pre-computed relationship pointers in constant time per hop
* As JOIN count increases, SQL performance degrades while Cypher remains consistent

SQL may be faster for:
* Simple single-table aggregations without traversal benefit
* Bulk operations with mature optimization
* Mathematical computations with more mature functions
