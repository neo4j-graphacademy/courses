= Validate Your Import
:order: 2
:type: challenge

Your challenge is to run the validation test plan from the previous lesson on your imported Northwind data.

[.slide]
== Your Task

Using the Neo4j Query tool or Browser, run the validation queries from Lesson 4.1:

. **Node counts** — Run `MATCH (n) RETURN labels(n)[0] AS label, COUNT(*) AS count ORDER BY label` and verify counts match: Customer 91, Order 830, Product 77, Category 8, Supplier 29, Employee 9, Shipper 3
. **Relationship counts** — Run `MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN type(r) AS relationshipType, COUNT(*) AS count` and confirm PLACED (830), CONTAINS (2155), and other relationship types have expected counts
. **Referential integrity** — Run a query to find orphan orders: `MATCH (o:Order) WHERE NOT (:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o) RETURN count(o) AS orphanOrders` (should return 0)
