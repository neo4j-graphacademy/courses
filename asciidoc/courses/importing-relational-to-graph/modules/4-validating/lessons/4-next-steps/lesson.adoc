Congratulations on completing "Importing Relational Data into Neo4j".

You have worked through the entire process of migrating data from a relational database into Neo4j:

* Analyzing relational schemas and understanding table relationships
* Designing a graph data model from relational tables
* Mapping foreign keys to graph relationships
* Planning constraints and indexes for data integrity
* Using the Neo4j Data Importer to import data
* Validating and querying your imported graph

== Apply This to Your Own Relational Data

If you want to migrate your own relational database (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, or any SQL source) to Neo4j, follow these steps:


=== Phase 1: Analyze Your Schema

The following SQL uses standard `information_schema`; adapt syntax as needed for your database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, BigQuery, etc.).

. **Document your tables** - List all tables in your database using:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
----

. **Identify foreign keys** - Find all relationships between tables:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    tc.table_name AS source_table,
    kcu.column_name AS foreign_key,
    ccu.table_name AS target_table,
    ccu.column_name AS target_column
FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu 
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage ccu 
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
----

. **Categorize your tables** using the framework from Lesson 2.2:
   * Entity tables become nodes
   * Junction tables become relationships
   * Lookup tables become properties or small nodes
   * Audit tables: evaluate if needed in graph


=== Phase 2: Design Your Graph Model

. **Create a visual model** using link:https://arrows.app[Arrows.app^]
. **Define node labels** — Use singular PascalCase names such as `Customer` and `Order`
. **Define relationship types** — Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE verbs such as `PLACED` and `CONTAINS`
. **Plan properties** - Decide which columns become properties and apply camelCase naming
. **Identify constraints** - Determine unique identifiers for each node type


=== Phase 3: Prepare Your Import

. **Create constraints first** - Adapt the constraint script from Lesson 2.5:
+
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT your_node_id IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (n:YourLabel) REQUIRE n.yourID IS UNIQUE;
----

. **Plan import order** - Follow the dependency chain:
   .. Independent nodes without foreign keys
   .. Dependent nodes that reference other nodes
   .. Relationships


=== Phase 4: Execute the Import

. **Connect your relational database or upload CSV files** to the Data Importer; see Lesson 1.2
. **Map tables to nodes** following your graph model design
. **Set unique identifiers** for each node type
. **Create relationships** by mapping foreign key columns
. **Run the import** and monitor for errors


=== Phase 5: Validate Your Import

. **Run node count queries** - Compare with source table counts
. **Run relationship count queries** - Compare with foreign key counts
. **Check for orphan nodes** - Find nodes missing expected relationships
. **Spot-check sample records** - Verify data accuracy
. **Test your use case queries** - Confirm the graph model supports your requirements


=== Quick Reference Checklist

Use this checklist when migrating your own data:

[%interactive]
* [ ] Schema documented: tables, columns, foreign keys
* [ ] Tables categorized: entity, junction, lookup, audit
* [ ] Graph model designed in Arrows.app
* [ ] Node labels and relationship types defined
* [ ] Constraints planned for all node types
* [ ] Import order determined
* [ ] Relational source connected or CSV files uploaded
* [ ] Nodes imported with unique identifiers
* [ ] Relationships created from foreign keys
* [ ] Validation queries executed
* [ ] Sample data verified
