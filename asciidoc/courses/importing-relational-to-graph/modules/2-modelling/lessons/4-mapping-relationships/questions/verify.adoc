= Junction Table Properties

When the `order_details` junction table becomes a `CONTAINS` relationship, what happens to the `quantity`, `unit_price`, and `discount` columns?

- [ ] They are lost during the transformation
- [ ] They become properties on the Order node
- [ ] They become properties on the Product node
- [x] They become properties on the CONTAINS relationship

.Hint
====
These values are specific to a particular order-product combination, not to the order or product alone.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The `quantity`, `unit_price`, and `discount` columns become **properties on the CONTAINS relationship**. This is because these values describe the specific instance of a product within an order - the same product could have different quantities and prices in different orders.

This is an advantage of graph databases: relationships can have properties, eliminating the need for junction tables.
