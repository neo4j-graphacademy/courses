= Relational to Graph Mapping

In a relational database, each row in the `customers` table represents one customer. When migrating to Neo4j, what does each row become?

- [ ] A property on the Customer node
- [ ] A relationship between nodes
- [x] An individual Customer node instance
- [ ] A node label

Think about the one-to-one relationship between records in a table and their graph equivalent.

.Solution
====
Each **row** in a relational table becomes an **individual node instance** in the graph.

For example:
* The `customers` table with 91 rows becomes 91 individual `Customer` nodes
* Each row's columns (like `company_name`, `city`) become properties on that specific node

The correct mapping is:
* Table → Node label
* Row → Node instance  
* Column → Property
* Foreign key → Relationship
