= Relational to Graph Mapping

In a relational database, each row in the `customers` table represents one customer. When migrating to Neo4j, what does each row become?

- [ ] A property on the Customer node
- [ ] A relationship between nodes
- [x] An individual Customer node instance
- [ ] A node label

.Hint
====
Each row in a relational table maps to one node instance in the graph; the table name becomes the node label, and the row's columns become properties on that node.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Each **row** in a relational table becomes an **individual node instance** in the graph.

For example:
* The `customers` table with 91 rows becomes 91 individual `Customer` nodes
* Each row's columns such as `company_name` and `city` become properties on that specific node

The correct mapping is:
* Table becomes node label
* Row becomes node instance  
* Column becomes property
* Foreign key becomes relationship
