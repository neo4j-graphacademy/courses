= Tables That Do Not Become Nodes

Which of the following scenarios would typically NOT result in creating a node in the graph? Select all that apply.

- [x] A junction table with only two foreign key columns
- [ ] A table representing customers with contact information
- [x] A small lookup table with 3 static values like "High", "Medium", "Low"
- [x] An audit log table tracking record modifications
- [ ] A table representing products with pricing and inventory data

.Hint
====
Junction tables with only foreign keys become relationships. Small lookup tables and audit logs often become properties or are omitted from the main graph; core entity tables such as customers and products become nodes.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The following typically do NOT become nodes:

* **Junction tables with only foreign keys** - These become relationships. Example: `employee_territories` becomes an `ASSIGNED_TO` relationship.

* **Small lookup tables with static values** - These can become node labels or properties instead. Example: Priority levels such as High, Medium, and Low can be a property on the node.

* **Audit log tables** - These often do not belong in the main graph model and may be kept in the relational database or a separate system.

Tables representing **customers** and **products** DO become nodes because they are core business entities with meaningful properties.
