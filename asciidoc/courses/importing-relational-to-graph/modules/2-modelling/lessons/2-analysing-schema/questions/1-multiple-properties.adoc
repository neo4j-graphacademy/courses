= Tables to Nodes

Which type of relational table typically becomes a relationship instead of a node in a graph model?

- [ ] Entity tables with a single primary key
- [x] Junction tables that connect two other tables
- [ ] Lookup tables with reference data
- [ ] Tables with many columns

.Hint
====
Junction tables (e.g. order_details) exist to connect two other tables and usually have composite primary keys made of foreign keys; in a graph they become relationships, not nodes.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Junction tables**, also called associative tables or bridge tables, typically become relationships in a graph model. These tables exist to implement many-to-many relationships in relational databases and usually have composite primary keys made up of foreign keys to other tables.

For example, `order_details` connects `orders` and `products` and becomes the `CONTAINS` relationship in the graph.
