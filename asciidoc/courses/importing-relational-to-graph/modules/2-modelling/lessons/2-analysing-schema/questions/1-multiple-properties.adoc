.Solution
====
**Junction tables** (also called associative tables or bridge tables) typically become relationships in a graph model. These tables exist to implement many-to-many relationships in relational databases and usually have composite primary keys made up of foreign keys to other tables.

For example, `order_details` connects `orders` and `products` and becomes the `CONTAINS` relationship in the graph.
