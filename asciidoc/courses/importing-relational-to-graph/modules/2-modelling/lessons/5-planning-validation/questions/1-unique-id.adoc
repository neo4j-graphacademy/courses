= Constraints and Indexes

Why should you create unique constraints on node identifier properties before importing data?

- [ ] To make queries run faster
- [ ] To enable full-text search
- [x] To prevent duplicate nodes and enable efficient MERGE operations
- [ ] Constraints are only needed after import

.Hint
====
Unique constraints prevent duplicate nodes when imports are re-run and provide an index that makes MERGE lookups fast when creating relationships.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Creating unique constraints before importing data serves two purposes:

1. **Prevents duplicate nodes** - If you accidentally run the import twice, the constraint will prevent creating duplicate nodes with the same identifier.

2. **Enables efficient MERGE operations** - When creating relationships, Neo4j uses MERGE to find or create nodes. A unique constraint with its backing index makes these lookups very fast.

Without constraints, you might end up with duplicate data and slow import performance.
