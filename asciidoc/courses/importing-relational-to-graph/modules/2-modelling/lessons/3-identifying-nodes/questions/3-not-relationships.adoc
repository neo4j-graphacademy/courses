= Foreign Keys That May Not Become Relationships

A table has a `status_id` foreign key pointing to a `statuses` table containing 5 values: "New", "Processing", "Shipped", "Delivered", "Cancelled". What is often the best approach?

- [ ] Create a Status node for each value and a HAS_STATUS relationship
- [x] Store status as a property on the node instead of creating a relationship
- [ ] Create 5 different relationship types, one for each status
- [ ] Ignore the status data entirely

Consider whether you need to traverse to the status or just filter/display it.

.Solution
====
For small lookup tables with static values, **storing as a property** is often the best approach:

(Order {status: "Shipped"})

**Why not create Status nodes?**

* Only 5 values - not worth the overhead of separate nodes
* You typically filter by status (`WHERE o.status = "Shipped"`) rather than traverse to it
* Status values are unlikely to have their own properties

**When WOULD you create Status nodes?**

* If statuses have additional properties (description, color, sort order)
* If you need to query "all possible statuses" independently
* If the status list is dynamic and managed separately
