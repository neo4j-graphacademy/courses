= Direction for Customer-Order

When designing a relationship between Customer and Order nodes, which direction best represents the business semantics?

- [x] `(Customer)-[:PLACED]->(Order)` — Customer placed the Order
- [ ] `(Order)-[:PLACED]->(Customer)` — Order placed the Customer
- [ ] Direction does not matter in Neo4j
- [ ] Both directions should be created


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The relationship direction should reflect who does the action: the customer performs the action of placing an order, so the arrow goes from Customer to Order.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
`(Customer)-[:PLACED]->(Order)` is the correct direction because it reflects the business semantics - a customer places an order, not the other way around.

While Neo4j allows traversing relationships in either direction, choosing a meaningful direction makes queries more readable and aligns with business semantics.
