= Relationship Naming

A relational table `orders` has a foreign key column `customer_id` that references `customers.customer_id`. What should the graph relationship type be named?

- [ ] `CUSTOMER_ID` - using the column name
- [ ] `ORDERS_CUSTOMERS` - using the table names
- [x] `PLACED` - using a meaningful verb describing the business action
- [ ] `FK_CUSTOMER` - using the foreign key prefix

Relationship types should describe the business meaning of the connection, not the technical implementation.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The relationship should be named **`PLACED`** (or similar verb like `MADE`, `SUBMITTED`).

**Why not the other options?**

* `CUSTOMER_ID` - This is the column name, not a meaningful relationship description
* `ORDERS_CUSTOMERS` - This describes the tables, not the business relationship
* `FK_CUSTOMER` - This is technical jargon from the relational model

Good relationship names:
* Use verbs that describe the action or connection
* Read naturally in a sentence: "Customer PLACED Order"
* Follow UPPER_SNAKE_CASE convention
