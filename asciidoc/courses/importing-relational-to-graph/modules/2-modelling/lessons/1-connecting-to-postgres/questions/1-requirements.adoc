Which SQL query would you use to find all foreign key relationships in a relational database?

- [x] Query the `information_schema.table_constraints` table with `constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'`
- [ ] `DESCRIBE TABLE relationships`

Query the `information_schema.table_constraints` table and filter by `constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'`. This returns all foreign key constraints. Similar catalogs exist in BigQuery, Snowflake, and other relational databases.
