:type: lesson

This lesson covers tools and setup. Use AuraDB Professional for Neo4j and Northwind CSV files for data. You'll use Data Importer in Module 3. The course focuses on schema analysis and modeling decisions; the source could be PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, or any relational store.


[.slide]
== What you need

To complete this course, you will need:

* A Neo4j AuraDB Professional instance (no credit card required)
* The Northwind CSV files (instructions below)
* Basic understanding of relational databases: tables, rows, columns, foreign keys
* Basic understanding of graph databases: nodes, relationships, properties
* Familiarity with SQL queries
* Basic knowledge of Cypher query language

=== Neo4j Database

Create an **AuraDB Professional** instance for this course:

* **No credit card required** - AuraDB Professional includes a free tier
* **Graph Data Science** - Run algorithms (PageRank, community detection) after importing
* **Data Importer included** - The visual import tool is built into the Aura console

[.slide.discrete]
=== Creating an AuraDB Professional instance

To create an AuraDB Professional instance:

. Go to link:https://console.neo4j.io/graphacademy[console.neo4j.io/graphacademy^]
. Sign in or create a Neo4j account
. Click **New Instance**
. Select **AuraDB Professional**
. Choose a region close to you
. Save your connection credentials securely

[.slide.discrete]
=== Why AuraDB Professional?

[TIP]
.Why AuraDB Professional?
====
AuraDB Professional provides access to Graph Data Science algorithms without requiring a credit card. After importing your data, you can run algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and pathfinding directly on your graph.
====


[.slide]
=== Northwind Dataset

The Northwind data is available as pre-exported CSV files in the Neo4j GitHub repository, ready to import directly into Neo4j:

Northwind CSV files: `https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/northwind/tree/main/import`

You can:

* Download the CSV files and upload them to the Neo4j Data Importer
* Use `LOAD CSV` in Cypher to import directly from the GitHub raw URLs

[TIP]
.Quick start
====
The import process is covered in Module 3. Use these CSV files with the Data Importer or Cypher in your AuraDB instance.
====


[.slide]
== Using the Data Importer

The Data Importer is built into the AuraDB console. For Northwind, use the CSV files from the previous section:


[.slide]
=== Open the Data Importer

. In Neo4j Aura, open your AuraDB Professional instance
. Click **Import** in the left sidebar


[.slide]
=== Add your data

. In the Data Importer, click **Files** and upload the Northwind CSV files from `https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/northwind/tree/main/import`
. Or drag and drop the CSV files into the Files panel


[.slide]
=== Map and import

After adding files to the canvas:

. Configure each file as a **Node** or use it to create **Relationships**
. Set the node labels and property mappings
. Define relationship types and connect nodes

Module 3 covers the mapping process in detail.


[.slide]
== Approaches for Importing Data

Data sources and import methods:

* Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
* Web APIs
* Public data directories
* BI tools
* Excel
* Flat files (CSV, JSON, XML)

[.slide.discrete]
=== Import factors and options

Import method depends on these factors:

* The source of the data
* The volume of data
* The frequency of the import
* The complexity of the data model
* The transformation required

Import approaches (choose based on your data volume, update frequency, and transformation needs):

* One-off batch import of all data 
* One-off load with a regular update
* Continuous import of data
* Real-time application updates
* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines

[.slide]
== Options for Importing Data

Import options and tools:

image::images/import-data-charts.svg[A flowchart showing numerous paths and options for importing data into Neo4j. The flowchart lists import tools such as neosemantics, Neo4j admin-import, Custom apps, ETL tools, and more.]

Use this flowchart to pick an import tool for your data source. For this course, you will use Neo4j Data Importer or Arrows.app (Module 3).

== Summary

In this lesson, you explored some of the approaches for importing data.

You can try the optional mapping challenge to practice the relational-to-graph concepts, or continue to the next module to start designing your graph model.
