[.slide]
=== Neo4j Database

You can complete this course using either a Neo4j Aura instance (cloud) or a self-managed Neo4j database.


==== Option A: Neo4j Aura (Recommended)

Neo4j Aura is the fully managed cloud service. For this course, create an **AuraDB Professional** instance:

* **No credit card required** - AuraDB Professional includes a free tier
* **Graph Data Science** - Run algorithms (PageRank, community detection) after importing
* **Data Importer included** - The visual import tool is built into the Aura console

[.slide.discrete]
=== Creating an AuraDB Professional instance

To create an AuraDB Professional instance:

. Go to link:https://console.neo4j.io/graphacademy[console.neo4j.io/graphacademy^]
. Sign in or create a Neo4j account
. Click **New Instance**
. Select **AuraDB Professional**
. Choose a region close to you
. Save your connection credentials securely

[.slide.discrete]
=== Why AuraDB Professional?

[TIP]
.Why AuraDB Professional?
====
AuraDB Professional provides access to Graph Data Science algorithms without requiring a credit card. After importing your data, you can run algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and pathfinding directly on your graph.
====


[.slide]
==== Option B: GraphAcademy Sandbox (Quick Start)

GraphAcademy provides a free Neo4j Sandbox for learning purposes. The sandbox is a temporary Neo4j instance that you can use to practice without any setup.

To use the GraphAcademy Sandbox:

. This course includes a sandbox that is automatically provisioned when you enroll
. Look for the **Sandbox** panel in the course interface (usually on the right side of lesson pages)
. Click **Open Sandbox** to launch Neo4j Browser connected to your sandbox instance
. Your sandbox credentials are displayed in the panel - use these if you need to connect external tools

[.slide.discrete]
=== Sandbox limitations

[NOTE]
.Sandbox limitations
====
The GraphAcademy Sandbox is designed for learning and has some limitations:

* **Temporary** - Sandboxes expire after a period of inactivity (typically 3 days)
* **Data persistence** - Data may be reset between sessions
* **No Data Importer UI** - You will use Cypher `LOAD CSV` commands instead of the visual Data Importer

For a persistent database with the full Data Importer experience, use AuraDB Professional (Option A).
====

[.slide.discrete]
=== Connecting external tools to Sandbox

To connect to your sandbox from external tools:

. Copy the **Bolt URL** from the Sandbox panel (format: `bolt://xxx.databases.neo4j.io:7687`)
. Use the provided **Username** (usually `neo4j`)
. Use the provided **Password**

You can use these credentials with:

* Neo4j Data Importer at `data-importer.neo4j.io` - Connect using the Bolt URL
* Neo4j Desktop - Add a remote connection
* Neo4j drivers in your applications


[.slide]
==== Option C: Self-Managed Neo4j

If you prefer to run Neo4j locally or on your own infrastructure:

* Download Neo4j Desktop from `neo4j.com/download`
* Or use Docker: `docker run -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 neo4j`

Self-managed installations work well for this course. The Data Importer tool is available in Neo4j Desktop and can also be accessed at `data-importer.neo4j.io`.


[.slide]
=== Northwind Dataset

There are two ways to access the Northwind data (introduced in the previous lesson):


[.slide]
==== Option A: Ready-to-Import CSV Files (Recommended)

The Northwind data has already been exported to CSV files and is available in the Neo4j GitHub repository, ready to import directly into Neo4j:

Northwind CSV files on GitHub: `https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/northwind/tree/main/import`

This is the fastest way to get started. You can:

* Download the CSV files and upload them to the Neo4j Data Importer
* Use `LOAD CSV` in Cypher to import directly from the GitHub raw URLs
* Skip the PostgreSQL setup entirely if you just want to focus on the Neo4j import process

[TIP]
.Quick start with CSV files
====
If you want to skip the relational database exploration and jump straight to importing data into Neo4j, use the pre-exported CSV files. The import process is covered in Module 3.
====


[.slide]
==== Option B: PostgreSQL Database (Optional - Full Experience)

If you want the complete experience of extracting data from a relational database, you can set up PostgreSQL with the Northwind data. This is optional but recommended if you want to:

* Explore the relational schema using SQL queries
* Practice exporting data from a relational database
* Understand the full migration workflow from source to target

**PostgreSQL Installation:**

Download and install from Postgres.app (macOS) or postgresql.org/download (Windows, Linux, macOS).

**PostgreSQL Client Tools (Optional):**

* **Postico** (macOS) - Search for "Postico" in the Mac App Store or visit eggerapps.at/postico2
* **pgAdmin** (Windows, Linux, macOS) - Search for "pgAdmin download" or visit pgadmin.org
* **DBeaver** (Cross-platform) - Search for "DBeaver download" or visit dbeaver.io

**Northwind SQL Script:**

* Northwind SQL script: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pthom/northwind_psql/master/northwind.sql`
* GitHub repository with Docker setup: `https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql`

[.slide.discrete]
==== Loading Northwind into PostgreSQL

Using the command line:

[source,bash]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pthom/northwind_psql/master/northwind.sql
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE northwind;"
psql -U postgres -d northwind -f northwind.sql
----

Or using a GUI tool (Postico, pgAdmin, DBeaver):

. Create a new database named `northwind`
. Open the SQL query tool
. Load and execute the `northwind.sql` script
. Verify the data by browsing the tables

[.slide.discrete]
==== Verify Northwind data

[TIP]
.Test your database
====
After loading the data, run these queries to verify:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;  -- Should return 91
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;     -- Should return 830
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;   -- Should return 77
----
====


[.slide]
== Connecting PostgreSQL to Neo4j Data Importer

How to set up a PostgreSQL data source in the Neo4j Data Importer:


[.slide]
=== Step 1: Open the Data Importer

. In Neo4j Aura, open your instance and click **Import** in the left sidebar
. For self-managed Neo4j, access the Data Importer at `data-importer.neo4j.io` or through Neo4j Desktop

// TODO: Add screenshot of Data Importer initial screen


[.slide]
=== Step 2: Add a Data Source

. In the Data Importer, click on **Data Sources** in the left panel
. Click **Add Data Source**
. Select **PostgreSQL** from the list of available database types

video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/importing-relational-data/new-data-source-postgres.mp4["Add a PostgreSQL data source", role="cdn", width=100%]


[.slide]
=== Step 3: Configure the PostgreSQL Connection

Enter your PostgreSQL connection details:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Field | Value for Northwind

| **Connection Name**
| `Northwind PostgreSQL` or any descriptive name

| **Host**
| `localhost` or your PostgreSQL server address

| **Port**
| `5432`, the default PostgreSQL port

| **Database**
| `northwind`

| **Username**
| `postgres` or your PostgreSQL username

| **Password**
| Your PostgreSQL password

|===

. Click **Test Connection** to verify the settings
. If the connection test succeeds, click **Save**

[.slide.discrete]
=== Network access for Aura

[NOTE]
.Network access for Aura
====
If you are using Neo4j Aura and your PostgreSQL database is running locally, you will need to make your PostgreSQL instance accessible from the internet. Options include:

* Using a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL service (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL)
* Setting up a tunnel using ngrok or similar tools
* Deploying PostgreSQL to a server with a public IP address

For learning purposes with Northwind, you may find it easier to export the data to CSV files and upload them directly to the Data Importer.
====


[.slide]
=== Step 4: Browse Tables and Select Data

Once connected, the Data Importer displays the available tables from your PostgreSQL database:

. Expand the data source in the left panel to see the list of tables
. Click on a table name to preview its data
. Select the tables you want to import by dragging them onto the mapping canvas

[.slide.discrete]
=== Northwind tables available

Select the tables you want to import from the data source. The core Northwind tables (`customers`, `orders`, `products`, etc.) were introduced in Module 1.

// TODO: Add screenshot of table list in Data Importer


[.slide]
=== Step 5: Map Tables to Nodes and Relationships

After adding tables to the canvas:

. Configure each table as a **Node** or use it to create **Relationships**
. Set the node labels and property mappings
. Define relationship types and connect nodes

The subsequent modules in this course cover the mapping process in detail.

[.slide.discrete]
=== Alternative: CSV file upload

[TIP]
.Alternative: CSV file upload
====
If you cannot connect directly to PostgreSQL, you can export tables to CSV files and upload them to the Data Importer:

. In PostgreSQL, export each table using:
+
[source,sql]
----
COPY customers TO '/path/to/customers.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY orders TO '/path/to/orders.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
-- Repeat for other tables
----

. In the Data Importer, click **Files** and upload your CSV files
. The mapping process is the same regardless of whether data comes from a database connection or CSV files
====


[.slide]
== Approaches for Importing Data

Data sources and import methods:

* Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
* Web APIs
* Public data directories
* BI tools
* Excel
* Flat files (CSV, JSON, XML)

[.slide.discrete]
=== Import factors and options

Import method depends on these factors:

* The source of the data
* The volume of data
* The frequency of the import
* The complexity of the data model
* The transformation required

Import approaches (choose based on your data volume, update frequency, and transformation needs):

* One-off batch import of all data 
* One-off load with a regular update
* Continuous import of data
* Real-time application updates
* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines

[.slide]
== Options for Importing Data

Import options and tools:

image::images/import-data-charts.svg[A flowchart showing numerous paths and options for importing data into Neo4j. The flowchart lists import tools such as neosemantics, Neo4j admin-import, Custom apps, ETL tools, and more.]

Use this flowchart to pick an import tool for your data source. For this course, you will use Neo4j Data Importer or Arrows.app (Module 3).
