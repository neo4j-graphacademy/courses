=== Neo4j Database

You can complete this course using either a Neo4j Aura instance (cloud) or a self-managed Neo4j database.


==== Option A: Neo4j Aura (Recommended)

Neo4j Aura is the fully managed cloud service. For this course, create an **AuraDB Professional** instance:

* **No credit card required** - AuraDB Professional includes a free tier
* **Graph Data Science support** - Professional instances support GDS algorithms, which you may want to use after importing your data
* **Data Importer included** - The visual import tool is built into the Aura console

To create an AuraDB Professional instance:

. Go to link:https://console.neo4j.io[console.neo4j.io^]
. Sign in or create a Neo4j account
. Click **New Instance**
. Select **AuraDB Professional**
. Choose a region close to you
. Save your connection credentials securely

[TIP]
.Why AuraDB Professional?
====
AuraDB Professional provides access to Graph Data Science algorithms without requiring a credit card. After importing your data, you can run algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and pathfinding directly on your graph.
====


==== Option B: GraphAcademy Sandbox (Quick Start)

GraphAcademy provides a free Neo4j Sandbox for learning purposes. The sandbox is a temporary Neo4j instance that you can use to practice without any setup.

To use the GraphAcademy Sandbox:

. This course includes a sandbox that is automatically provisioned when you enroll
. Look for the **Sandbox** panel in the course interface (usually on the right side of lesson pages)
. Click **Open Sandbox** to launch Neo4j Browser connected to your sandbox instance
. Your sandbox credentials are displayed in the panel - use these if you need to connect external tools

[NOTE]
.Sandbox limitations
====
The GraphAcademy Sandbox is designed for learning and has some limitations:

* **Temporary** - Sandboxes expire after a period of inactivity (typically 3 days)
* **Data persistence** - Data may be reset between sessions
* **No Data Importer UI** - You will use Cypher `LOAD CSV` commands instead of the visual Data Importer

For a persistent database with the full Data Importer experience, use AuraDB Professional (Option A).
====

To connect to your sandbox from external tools:

. Copy the **Bolt URL** from the Sandbox panel (format: `bolt://xxx.databases.neo4j.io:7687`)
. Use the provided **Username** (usually `neo4j`)
. Use the provided **Password**

You can use these credentials with:

* Neo4j Data Importer at `workspace.neo4j.io/workspace/import` - Connect using the Bolt URL
* Neo4j Desktop - Add a remote connection
* Neo4j drivers in your applications


==== Option C: Self-Managed Neo4j

If you prefer to run Neo4j locally or on your own infrastructure:

* Download Neo4j Desktop from `neo4j.com/download`
* Or use Docker: `docker run -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 neo4j`

Self-managed installations work well for this course. The Data Importer tool is available in Neo4j Desktop and can also be accessed at `workspace.neo4j.io/workspace/import`.


=== Northwind Dataset

The Northwind database is a sample relational database that represents a fictional company's sales data. You will use this dataset throughout the course to practice importing relational data into Neo4j.

There are two ways to access the Northwind data:


==== Option A: Ready-to-Import CSV Files (Recommended)

The Northwind data has already been exported to CSV files and is available in the Neo4j GitHub repository, ready to import directly into Neo4j:

Northwind CSV files on GitHub: `https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/northwind/tree/main/import`

This is the fastest way to get started. You can:

* Download the CSV files and upload them to the Neo4j Data Importer
* Use `LOAD CSV` in Cypher to import directly from the GitHub raw URLs
* Skip the PostgreSQL setup entirely if you just want to focus on the Neo4j import process

[TIP]
.Quick start with CSV files
====
If you want to skip the relational database exploration and jump straight to importing data into Neo4j, use the pre-exported CSV files. The import process is covered in Module 3.
====


==== Option B: PostgreSQL Database (Optional - Full Experience)

If you want the complete experience of extracting data from a relational database, you can set up PostgreSQL with the Northwind data. This is optional but recommended if you want to:

* Explore the relational schema using SQL queries
* Practice exporting data from a relational database
* Understand the full migration workflow from source to target

**PostgreSQL Installation:**

Download and install from Postgres.app (macOS) or postgresql.org/download (Windows, Linux, macOS).

**PostgreSQL Client Tools (Optional):**

* **Postico** (macOS) - Search for "Postico" in the Mac App Store or visit eggerapps.at/postico2
* **pgAdmin** (Windows, Linux, macOS) - Search for "pgAdmin download" or visit pgadmin.org
* **DBeaver** (Cross-platform) - Search for "DBeaver download" or visit dbeaver.io

**Northwind SQL Script:**

* Northwind SQL script: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pthom/northwind_psql/master/northwind.sql`
* GitHub repository with Docker setup: `https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql`


===== Loading Northwind into PostgreSQL

Using the command line:

[source,bash]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pthom/northwind_psql/master/northwind.sql
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE northwind;"
psql -U postgres -d northwind -f northwind.sql
----

Or using a GUI tool (Postico, pgAdmin, DBeaver):

. Create a new database named `northwind`
. Open the SQL query tool
. Load and execute the `northwind.sql` script
. Verify the data by browsing the tables

[TIP]
.Test your database
====
After loading the data, run these queries to verify:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;  -- Should return 91
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;     -- Should return 830
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;   -- Should return 77
----
====


== Connecting PostgreSQL to Neo4j Data Importer

The Neo4j Data Importer can connect directly to PostgreSQL databases, allowing you to import data without manually exporting to CSV files. This section explains how to set up a PostgreSQL data source connection.


=== Step 1: Open the Data Importer

. In Neo4j Aura, open your instance and click **Import** in the left sidebar
. For self-managed Neo4j, access the Data Importer at `workspace.neo4j.io/workspace/import` or through Neo4j Desktop

// TODO: Add screenshot of Data Importer initial screen


=== Step 2: Add a Data Source

. In the Data Importer, click on **Data Sources** in the left panel
. Click **Add Data Source**
. Select **PostgreSQL** from the list of available database types

// TODO: Add screenshot of Add Data Source dialog


=== Step 3: Configure the PostgreSQL Connection

Enter your PostgreSQL connection details:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Field | Value for Northwind

| **Connection Name**
| `Northwind PostgreSQL` (or any descriptive name)

| **Host**
| `localhost` (or your PostgreSQL server address)

| **Port**
| `5432` (default PostgreSQL port)

| **Database**
| `northwind`

| **Username**
| `postgres` (or your PostgreSQL username)

| **Password**
| Your PostgreSQL password

|===

. Click **Test Connection** to verify the settings
. If the connection test succeeds, click **Save**

[NOTE]
.Network access for Aura
====
If you are using Neo4j Aura and your PostgreSQL database is running locally, you will need to make your PostgreSQL instance accessible from the internet. Options include:

* Using a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL service (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL)
* Setting up a tunnel using ngrok or similar tools
* Deploying PostgreSQL to a server with a public IP address

For learning purposes with Northwind, you may find it easier to export the data to CSV files and upload them directly to the Data Importer.
====


=== Step 4: Browse Tables and Select Data

Once connected, the Data Importer displays the available tables from your PostgreSQL database:

. Expand the data source in the left panel to see the list of tables
. Click on a table name to preview its data
. Select the tables you want to import by dragging them onto the mapping canvas

The available Northwind tables include:

* `customers`
* `orders`
* `order_details`
* `products`
* `categories`
* `suppliers`
* `employees`
* `shippers`

// TODO: Add screenshot of table list in Data Importer


=== Step 5: Map Tables to Nodes and Relationships

After adding tables to the canvas:

. Configure each table as a **Node** or use it to create **Relationships**
. Set the node labels and property mappings
. Define relationship types and connect nodes

The subsequent modules in this course cover the mapping process in detail.

[TIP]
.Alternative: CSV file upload
====
If you cannot connect directly to PostgreSQL, you can export tables to CSV files and upload them to the Data Importer:

. In PostgreSQL, export each table using:
+
[source,sql]
----
COPY customers TO '/path/to/customers.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY orders TO '/path/to/orders.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
-- Repeat for other tables
----

. In the Data Importer, click **Files** and upload your CSV files
. The mapping process is the same regardless of whether data comes from a database connection or CSV files
====


== Approaches for Importing Data

Importing data refers to the process of moving data from one system into Neo4j. 
The import could be a one-time operation, or it could be a regular process that needs to be automated.

Typically, the source system would have a different data model than Neo4j, and by importing data, you would transform the data into a graph model.

The source may expose data in different ways, for example:

* Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
* Web APIs
* Public data directories
* BI tools
* Excel
* Flat files (CSV, JSON, XML)

The method by which you import data into Neo4j will depend on several factors, including:

* The source of the data
* The volume of data
* The frequency of the import
* The complexity of the data model
* The transformation required

The options available are numerous, and include:

* One-off batch import of all data 
* One-off load with a regular update
* Continuous import of data
* Real-time application updates
* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines

Ultimately, how you import data into Neo4j will depend on your specific requirements.
