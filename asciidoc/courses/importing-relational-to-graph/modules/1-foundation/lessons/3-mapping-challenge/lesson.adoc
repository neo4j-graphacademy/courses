Your challenge is to apply the relational-to-graph mapping by designing a minimal graph model.

[.slide]
== The Scenario

You have a simple relational schema:

* `customers` table: `customer_id`, `company_name`, `city`
* `orders` table: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`
* `order_items` table: `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`

The foreign keys are: `orders.customer_id` references `customers.customer_id`, and `order_items` links `orders` to `products`.

[.slide]
== Your Task

Using link:https://arrows.app[Arrows.app^], create a graph model:

. Add three node labels: `Customer`, `Order`, `Product`
. Add two relationship types: `PLACED` (Customer to Order) and `CONTAINS` (Order to Product)
. Add at least one property to the `CONTAINS` relationship: `quantity`

This models the junction table `order_items` as a relationship with properties.

[.slide]
== Verify Your Model

Your model should show:

* Customer nodes connected to Order nodes by `PLACED`
* Order nodes connected to Product nodes by `CONTAINS` with a `quantity` property

== Summary

In this challenge, you applied the mapping rules: entity tables became nodes, and the junction table became a relationship with properties.
