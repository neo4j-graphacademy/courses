= Understanding relational and graph models

Which of the following statements best describes a difference between relational and graph data models?

* [ ] Relational databases store data in tables, while graph databases store data in documents
* [x] Relational databases use foreign keys to represent relationships implicitly, while graph databases store relationships explicitly as first-class citizens
* [ ] Graph databases require JOIN operations to traverse relationships, while relational databases traverse relationships directly
* [ ] Relational databases have flexible schemas, while graph databases require rigid schema definitions

.Hint
====
Relationships are represented and accessed differently in each model. Consider whether relationships are stored directly or need to be computed.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Relational databases use foreign keys to represent relationships implicitly, while graph databases store relationships explicitly as first-class citizens.**

In relational databases, relationships between tables are represented through foreign key columns that reference primary keys in other tables. These relationships are implicit and require JOIN operations to traverse.

In graph databases, relationships are stored directly as edges between nodes. They are first-class citizens with their own properties and can be traversed directly without JOIN operations, making relationship queries much faster.
