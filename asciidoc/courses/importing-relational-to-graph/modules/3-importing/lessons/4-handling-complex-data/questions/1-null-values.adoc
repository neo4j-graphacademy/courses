= Handling NULL Values

What happens when you import a property with a NULL value into Neo4j?

- [ ] Neo4j stores the property with a NULL value
- [ ] Neo4j throws an error and stops the import
- [x] Neo4j does not create the property at all
- [ ] Neo4j converts NULL to an empty string

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
When importing data with NULL values, **Neo4j does not create the property at all**. 

Unlike relational databases that explicitly store NULL values, Neo4j simply omits properties that have no value. This means nodes of the same label can have different sets of properties.

If you need to distinguish between "unknown" and "not applicable," you should use a specific value (like "N/A" or "Unknown") instead of relying on NULL.
