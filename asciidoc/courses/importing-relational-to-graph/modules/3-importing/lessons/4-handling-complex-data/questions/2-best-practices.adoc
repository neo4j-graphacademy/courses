= Import Best Practices

What is the correct order for importing relational data into Neo4j?

- [ ] Import all nodes first, then create all constraints, then create relationships
- [ ] Import relationships first, then nodes, then constraints
- [x] Create constraints first, then import independent nodes, then dependent nodes, then relationships
- [ ] The order does not matter as long as all data is imported

Think about what needs to exist before you can create relationships, and what helps ensure data integrity during import.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct order is:

1. **Create constraints first** - Enables MERGE operations and prevents duplicates
2. **Import independent nodes** - Nodes with no foreign keys (Categories, Suppliers, Shippers)
3. **Import dependent nodes** - Nodes that reference other nodes (Products, Customers, Employees, Orders)
4. **Create relationships** - All referenced nodes must exist first

This order ensures:
* No duplicate nodes are created
* All foreign key references can be resolved
* Relationships connect to existing nodes
* Import is idempotent (can be re-run safely)
