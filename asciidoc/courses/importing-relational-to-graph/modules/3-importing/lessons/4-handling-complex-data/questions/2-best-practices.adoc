= Import Best Practices

What is the correct order for importing relational data into Neo4j?

- [ ] Import all nodes first, then create all constraints, then create relationships
- [ ] Import relationships first, then nodes, then constraints
- [x] Create constraints first, then import independent nodes, then dependent nodes, then relationships
- [ ] The order does not matter as long as all data is imported


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Relationships connect two nodes, so those nodes must exist first. Constraints prevent duplicates and speed MERGE; the safe order is constraints, then independent nodes, then dependent nodes, then relationships.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct order is:

1. **Create constraints first** - Enables MERGE operations and prevents duplicates
2. **Import independent nodes** — Nodes with no foreign keys such as Categories, Suppliers, Shippers
3. **Import dependent nodes** — Nodes that reference other nodes such as Products, Customers, Employees, Orders
4. **Create relationships** - All referenced nodes must exist first

This order ensures:
* No duplicate nodes are created
* All foreign key references can be resolved
* Relationships connect to existing nodes
* Import is idempotent and can be re-run safely
