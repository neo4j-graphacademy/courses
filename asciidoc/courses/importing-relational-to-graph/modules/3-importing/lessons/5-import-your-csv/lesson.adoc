It could be a file you have created, an export from a relational database, or one from the link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples[Neo4j graph examples^] (Northwind, recommendations, and other sample datasets).
. Review the source data structure and quality.
. Define a graph data model for your data.
+
It should include at least two different node labels and one relationship.
. Use the Neo4j Data Importer to import the data.

**Aura:** Open your instance and click **Import** in the left sidebar.
**Sandbox:** Open link:https://data-importer.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Data Importer^] and connect with your sandbox credentials.
