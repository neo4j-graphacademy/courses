= Relationship ID Mapping

.Hint
====
Relationships connect nodes using their unique identifiers. The Data Importer needs to know which column in the CSV matches the ID on each node.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
You must map the **unique identifiers (IDs) of the source and target nodes**. The Data Importer uses these IDs to find the correct nodes and create the relationship between them.

For example, to create a `PLACED` relationship between Customer and Order, you map:

* **From ID**: The column containing customer IDs (matching Customer's unique identifier)
* **To ID**: The column containing order IDs (matching Order's unique identifier)
