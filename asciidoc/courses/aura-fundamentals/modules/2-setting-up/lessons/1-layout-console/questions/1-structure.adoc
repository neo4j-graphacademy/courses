.Solution
====
**One organization with one or more projects underneath. Projects contain database instances.**

The correct hierarchy is Organization → Project → Database Instance. While it's true that the Organization ID and the default project ID are identical (to simplify support), the structure is still hierarchical with the organization at the top level.
