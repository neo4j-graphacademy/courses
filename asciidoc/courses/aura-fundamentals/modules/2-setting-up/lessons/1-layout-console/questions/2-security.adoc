= Security in the Aura console

Which one of these is true?

* [ ] In Aura, security is very limited. You manage it in the console and it trickles down to the databases. Totally inadequate for a serious organisation.
* [x] The security of the Aura console only applies to the console. MFA can be used. The main purpose of multiple projects is to make it more granular. The security of the database instances (and thus data access) is unrelated to it.
* [ ] You create an admin instance that manages the security of the Aura console.

The security of the Aura console and the database instances is not related. Improving the security of the Aura console is a major topic in the Aura roadmap and feedback in that area is taken **very** seriously.
