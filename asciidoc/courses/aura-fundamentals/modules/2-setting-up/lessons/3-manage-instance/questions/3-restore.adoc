= Restore from backup file

Does a restore of a backup file > 4GB from a local system to Aura require the Neo4j software to be on that local system?

* [ ] No. Of course not. Why would you need that too? 
* [x] Yes it does. You need the **neo4j-admin database upload** command.
* [ ] A specific Aura client is needed, not the Neo4j software.
