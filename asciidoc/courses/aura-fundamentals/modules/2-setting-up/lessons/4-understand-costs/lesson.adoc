= Understanding Costs
:table-caption!:

== Example
A comparison is made between the cheapest possible self-managed single instance setup and an **Aura Professional** instance of the same size.

The following assumptions are made:

* For **self-managed** a standard (1) machine on AWS is selected.
* For **self-managed** the *free* Neo4j Community Edition is selected.
* Performance or suitability for a specific task is not taken into account. This is a price comparison.
* The memory/storage ratio is 1/2.

| |Self Managed |Aura Professional

|**specification** |2 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 16GB storage |2 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 16GB storage
|**price/month(2)** |$63.38|$525.60

[NOTE]
====
(1) The machine selected is the **t2.large**, which is **not** the machine type used in Aura. This is a price comparison.

(2) Based on the AWS price calculator (2025/06/20) and available cost calculation in Aura. A month has an average of 730 hours. 100% uptime is assumed.

Well, might as well end this training here then. That looks like a clearcut case!

[NOTE]
====
1. Neo4j Community edition requires that you abide by the GPL v3 license.
2. The Enterprise Edition software does have RBAC but the **Aura Professional** tier is limited in that respect.
3. Neo4j Community Edition only allows a dump/load of the database. The database has to be stopped for that.
4. It is possible to use the community forums for support.

== Discussion
All these points can and should be quantified for your organization. Note that the biggest cost isn't even mentioned yet. The cost of the person setting it up and maintaining it.

And whilst that can - to some degree - be automated, that automation has to be created (at least once) though. Upgrades have to be planned and tested. Backups have to be managed. It's quite the list.

== Tiers & ACUs
For each tier a similar comparison can be made:

* A cluster is going to be more expensive than a single instance
* Dedicated infrastructure is more expensive than shared infrastructure.
* Hourly backups require more storage than daily backups. 
* Vector indexes are very storage and memory hungry.
* ...

Commitment can influence the cost. **Aura Consumption Units (ACUs)** can be bought up front. Consumption agreements with your cloud provider can be used for Aura.

== Conclusion
Yes, Aura is **not** cheap.

Yes, there are use cases in which **self-managed** (even with a Neo4j Enterprise Edition license) is the cheaper and better option.

So

* make an **informed** decision
* compare apples to apples
* size your instances correctly
* pick the correct Aura tier for your use case requirements
* commitment can save in the long run
 
and remember that your business is unlikely to be setting up and maintaining complex IT database infrastructure. Neo4j's business **is**!
