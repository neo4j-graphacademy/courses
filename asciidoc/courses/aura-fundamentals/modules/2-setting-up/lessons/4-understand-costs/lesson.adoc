= Understanding costs
:optional: true

// TODO: the pause/resume content has been moved from 3-manage-instances to here.  Consider moving it back and removing the cold hard truth in here.

Now that you know how to create and manage Aura instances, you might be wondering about the costs involved and how they compare to managing your own Neo4j infrastructure.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Compare Aura costs with self-managed alternatives
* Understand what's included in Aura pricing beyond just compute resources
* Manage costs effectively through pausing and right-sizing instances

Understanding costs upfront helps you make informed decisions about when Aura makes sense for your organization and how to optimize your spending.

== Comparing costs at first glance

Let's start with a direct price comparison between the cheapest possible self-managed setup and an Aura Professional instance of the same size.

The following assumptions are made:

* For self-managed, a standard machine on AWS is selected
* For self-managed, the free Neo4j Community Edition is selected
* Performance or suitability for specific tasks is not considered - this is purely a price comparison
* The memory/storage ratio is 1/2

| |Self Managed |Aura Professional

|**Price/month** |$63.38|$525.60

[NOTE]
.Comparison limitations
====
The self-managed machine selected is the t2.large, which is not the machine type used in Aura. This is a price comparison only.

Based on the AWS price calculator (2025/06/20) and available cost calculation in Aura. A month has an average of 730 hours. 100% uptime is assumed.

Well, that looks like a clear-cut case! But let's dig deeper.

== Understanding what you're actually paying for

The real comparison requires looking at everything that's included:

[NOTE]
.Important considerations
====
Neo4j Community edition requires that you abide by the GPL v3 license.

The Enterprise Edition software does have RBAC but the Aura Professional tier is limited in that respect.

Neo4j Community Edition only allows a dump/load of the database. The database has to be stopped for that operation.

It is possible to use the community forums for support with self-managed setups.
====

All these points can and should be quantified for your organization. Note that the biggest cost isn't even mentioned yet: the cost of the person setting up and maintaining it.

And while that can be automated to some degree, that automation has to be created (at least once). Upgrades have to be planned and tested. Backups have to be managed. It's quite the list.

== Optimizing costs across tiers

For each tier, a similar comparison can be made:

* A cluster is going to be more expensive than a single instance
* Dedicated infrastructure is more expensive than shared infrastructure
* Hourly backups require more storage than daily backups
* Vector indexes are very storage and memory hungry

Commitment can influence the cost. Aura Consumption Units (ACUs) can be bought up front. Consumption agreements with your cloud provider can be used for Aura.

== Managing costs through pausing

One of the most direct ways to control costs is by pausing instances when they're not in use.

=== Understanding pause behavior

Pausing an instance is - in all cases - a cost-saving decision. Who is footing the bill is therefore important.

The behavior differs by tier:

**Aura Free** instances:

* Cannot be manually paused
* Auto-pause after 72 hours of inactivity  
* Deleted after 30 days of being paused

**Aura Professional / Business Critical / Virtual Dedicated Cloud** instances:

* Can be manually paused
* Are not auto-paused when inactive
* Automatically resumed after 30 days of pausing

Think of pausing like putting your instance into hibernation - it stops consuming resources (and costs) but can be quickly awakened when needed.

=== When to pause instances

Consider pausing instances in these scenarios:

* Development environments during off-hours
* Testing environments between testing cycles
* Staging environments when not actively used
* Temporary instances for specific projects

[WARNING]
.Coordinate before pausing
====
Pausing stops all database activity, so coordinate with your team before pausing shared instances.

== Making informed decisions

Yes, Aura is not cheap.

Yes, there are use cases in which self-managed (even with a Neo4j Enterprise Edition license) is the cheaper and better option.

So:

* Make an informed decision
* Compare apples to apples
* Size your instances correctly
* Pick the correct Aura tier for your use case requirements
* Commitment can save in the long run
 
And remember that your business is unlikely to be setting up and maintaining complex IT database infrastructure. Neo4j's business is!

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about what makes up the cost of Aura and how it compares to self-managed alternatives. You discovered that while Aura may appear more expensive at first glance, it includes many services and capabilities that would need to be built and maintained separately in a self-managed setup.

You also learned practical cost management techniques, particularly how to use pausing to control costs for development and testing environments.

Understanding these cost factors helps you make informed decisions about when Aura makes sense for your organization and how to optimize your spending once you're using it.

Next, you'll learn about backup and restore operations - one of those valuable included services that would require significant effort to implement and maintain in a self-managed environment.
