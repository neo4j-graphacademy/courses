False. The rates are fixed and public. Even for **Aura Virtual Dedicated Cloud** instances. The only reason you **must** pass by sales first for those is that they require an upfront commitment.

Cloud provider commitments and large ACU commitments **can** influence the price of the ACUs. And since those maintain their value against the rates (1 ACU = $1, regardless of what you paid for it), costs savings can be made there.
