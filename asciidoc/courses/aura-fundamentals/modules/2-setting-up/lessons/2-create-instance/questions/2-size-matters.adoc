= Size matters

Can you tweak the number of CPUs for any Aura instance?

* [ ] Yes of course. Obviously you can have a very small instance with tons of CPU.
* [ ] Maybe. Who pays the piper, determines the tune. It might not be on the menu but you can probably *arrange* it.
* [x] No. You can only choose **memory size** and **memory to storage ratio**.

.Solution
====
The only options you have for Aura are **memory size** and **memory to storage ratio**. If the assigned CPU to match those is not up to your expectations or requirements you need to go bigger on **memory size**.

If you want to go fully custom, Aura might not be the correct choice for you. And if **self managed** is not for you, then Neo4j can offer Managed Services (in your cloud account or on premise).
