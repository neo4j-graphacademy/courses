= Size Matters

Can you adjust the number of CPUs for any Aura instance?

* [ ] Yes, absolutely! You can have a very small instance with lots of CPU power.
* [ ] Maybe. If you're willing to pay extra, you might be able to get special arrangements.
* [x] No. You can only choose **memory size** and **memory to storage ratio**.

.Solution
====
**No.** With Aura, you're limited to choosing **memory size** and **memory to storage ratio**. The CPU allocation is automatically determined based on your memory selection. If you need more processing power, you'll need to increase the **memory size** to get additional CPU resources.

For fully customizable configurations, you might want to explore other Neo4j deployment options like self-managed instances or Neo4j Managed Services.
