The correct answers are:

* **Export the snapshot to your local machine** - Download for archival or compliance purposes
* **Create a new instance from the snapshot** - Spin up a fresh instance with the snapshot's data  
* **Restore the snapshot to overwrite the current instance** - Revert to the snapshot's point in time

You cannot directly share snapshots with other Aura users - you would need to export the snapshot and share the file through your own secure channels.
