.Solution
====
To connect to your Aura instance, you need the following details:
* **Connection URI**: The connection string used to connect to your database.
* **Username**: The username for your database instance.
* **Password**: The password associated with your username.
* **Database name**: The name of the specific database you want to connect to within your Aura instance.

You do not need to know the cloud provider to connect to your Aura instance, as this information is abstracted away by the service.
