.Solution
====
The structure of the Aura console consists of three main components: Organizations, Projects, and Instances.
- **Organizations** are the top-level component that represents a group or company using Aura.
- **Projects** are used to group related database instances within an organization.
- **Instances** are the actual Neo4j database instances where your data is stored and managed.
- **Nodes** are not part of the console structure; they are elements within a Neo4j database.
