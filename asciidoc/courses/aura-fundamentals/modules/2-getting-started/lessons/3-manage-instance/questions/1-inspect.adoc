====
The Inspect panel shows connection details, version info, and allows renaming. Destructive actions like Delete and tier changes like Upgrade are accessed elsewhere.

The correct answers are:

* **View connection details and database URI** - The inspect panel shows the connection information needed to connect to your database.

* **Rename your instance using the pencil icon** - Click the pencil icon next to the instance name to change it.

* **View current Neo4j version and tier information** - The panel displays the current Neo4j version and which tier (Free, Professional, etc.) your instance is running on.

Deleting and upgrading are separate options in the three-dot menu, not part of the inspect panel itself.
