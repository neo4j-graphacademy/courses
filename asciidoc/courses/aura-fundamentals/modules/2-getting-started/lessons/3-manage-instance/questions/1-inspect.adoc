.Hint
====
The inspect panel is specifically for viewing information and basic instance management. Think about what you can see and modify directly within this panel versus what requires other menu options.

The correct answers are:

* **View connection details and database URI** - The inspect panel shows the connection information needed to connect to your database.

* **Rename your instance using the pencil icon** - You can click the pencil icon next to the instance name to change it.

* **View current Neo4j version and tier information** - The panel displays the current Neo4j version and which tier (Free, Professional, etc.) your instance is running on.

Deleting and upgrading are separate options in the three-dot menu, not part of the inspect panel itself.
