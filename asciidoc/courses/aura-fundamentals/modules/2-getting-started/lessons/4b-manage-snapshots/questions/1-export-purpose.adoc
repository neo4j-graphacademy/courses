Aura snapshots are automatically deleted after the retention period for your tier. Exporting downloads the snapshot to your local storage for long-term archival.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Export preserves snapshots beyond Aura's retention period.**

Aura automatically deletes snapshots after the retention period (7 days for Professional, 30 days for Business Critical). Exporting downloads the snapshot to your local machine, allowing you to keep it indefinitely for compliance or long-term backup needs.
