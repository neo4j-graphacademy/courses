== Understanding backups and snapshots

Data protection is one of the most important aspects of database management. Whether you're preparing for a major application update, migrating between environments, or simply want to ensure you can recover from unexpected problems, having a solid backup and restore strategy is essential.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Understand Aura's snapshot system for automated backups
* Differentiate between scheduled and on-demand snapshots
* Choose the right snapshot type for your use case

[.slide]
== Understanding Aura snapshots

Snapshots are Aura's backup mechanism. Your tier determines when snapshots are taken automatically and how long they are retained.

**Why snapshots matter for your recommendation engine:** If you accidentally delete movie data or need to restore to a previous state, snapshots protect your recommendation engine's data. They provide point-in-time recovery, allowing you to restore your instance to any snapshot.

== Scheduled and on-demand snapshots

Aura provides two types of snapshots:

**Scheduled snapshots** are taken automatically based on your tier:

* Provide regular, predictable backup points
* Require no manual intervention
* Retention period determined by tier

**On-demand snapshots** are triggered manually:

* Take a snapshot whenever you need one
* Useful before risky operations or major changes
* Same retention period as scheduled snapshots (except Free tier)

**How it works in the background:** Aura's automation system:
1. Monitors your instance for scheduled snapshot times
2. Creates a point-in-time copy of your database
3. Stores the snapshot in encrypted cloud storage
4. Manages retention based on your tier

== Snapshot frequency and retention by tier

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Tier |Scheduled Snapshots |Retention

|**Free**
|None (on-demand only)
|Latest snapshot only

|**Professional**
|Daily
|7 days

|**Business Critical**
|Hourly
|30 days

|**Virtual Dedicated Cloud**
|Hourly (days 1-7), Daily (days 8-60)
|60 days
|===

**Why retention matters:** Longer retention periods give you more restore points. For your recommendation engine, this means you can recover from data issues that occurred days or weeks ago, depending on your tier.

Use the diagram to determine whether you need an on-demand snapshot, should rely on scheduled snapshots, or need to export for long-term storage.

=== Snapshot use cases

**Use scheduled snapshots** for:

* Regular disaster recovery protection
* Compliance requirements for periodic backups
* General data protection without manual effort

**Use on-demand snapshots** for:

* Before major application updates or schema changes
* After significant data imports (like loading your movie dataset)
* Before performing risky operations (bulk deletes, migrations)
* Creating a known-good restore point before testing

**Example for your recommendation engine:** Create an on-demand snapshot after importing your movie data. This gives you a restore point if you need to revert changes to your recommendation queries or data model.

[.summary]
== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about Aura's snapshot system for backups. You:

* **Understood snapshots**: Learned that snapshots are Aura's backup mechanism, providing point-in-time recovery
* **Differentiated snapshot types**: Distinguished between scheduled (automatic) and on-demand (manual) snapshots
* **Learned tier differences**: Understood how snapshot frequency and retention vary by tier
* **Chose the right approach**: Learned when to use scheduled and on-demand snapshots

Snapshots protect your data. Scheduled snapshots provide automatic protection, while on-demand snapshots let you create restore points before risky operations.

For more information on snapshots, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/managing-instances/backup-restore-export/[Neo4j Aura documentation on backup, export, and restore^].

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to create and manage snapshots, including exporting them for long-term storage.
