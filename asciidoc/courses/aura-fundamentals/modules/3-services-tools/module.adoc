:order: 3

In this module, you will work with the Aura console tools to **import**, **query**, and **explore** data. You will also learn how to build a simple dashboard.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Import data into your Aura instance using the Data Importer
* Query data using Cypher in the Query tool
* Explore your graph visually using the Explore tool
* Build a dashboard to visualize your data


== Choosing the right tool for your data

Aura provides three complementary tools for interacting with your graph data. Each tool serves different users and use cases:

[cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
|Tool |Best for |Data scale |Requires Cypher?

|**Query**
|Developers, DBAs, data engineers
|Hundreds of nodes/relationships
|Yes

|**Explore**
|Business analysts, domain experts
|Thousands of nodes/relationships
|No (uses search phrases)

|**Dashboards**
|Stakeholders, executives, end users
|Aggregated metrics and summaries
|Created with Cypher, used without

=== How data type affects tool choice

**Highly connected data** (social networks, fraud detection):

* Use **Explore** to visually trace connections and discover patterns
* Use **Query** when you need precise path-finding algorithms
* Use **Dashboards** to show metrics like "average connections per user"

**Hierarchical data** (org charts, product catalogs):

* Use **Explore** to navigate parent-child relationships visually
* Use **Query** for recursive traversals and aggregations
* Use **Dashboards** to display tree summaries and counts

**Time-series or transactional data** (logs, orders, events):

* Use **Query** for date-range filtering and aggregations
* Use **Dashboards** for trend visualizations and KPIs
* Use **Explore** to investigate specific transactions or anomalies

**Knowledge graphs** (recommendations, semantic data):

* Use **Explore** with Perspectives to provide business-friendly views
* Use **Query** for complex inference and similarity searches
* Use **Dashboards** to surface recommendations to end users
