The correct answer is **Graph view**.

The Query tool displays results in multiple formats:

* **Graph view** - Visualizes relationships between nodes, showing connection patterns. Works well for small to medium result sets.
* **Table view** - Displays aggregated results, property comparisons, and data for export.
* **Text/JSON view** - Shows raw property values for debugging or programmatic use.
