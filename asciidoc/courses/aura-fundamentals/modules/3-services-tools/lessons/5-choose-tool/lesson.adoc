== Comparing and choosing the right tool

So far in this course,you have used the Import tool, Query, Explore, and Dashboards tools.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Decide when to use Import, Query, Explore, or Dashboards
* Match each tool to typical tasks, users, and data scale
* See how data type (connected, hierarchical, time-series, knowledge graph) affects tool choice
* Combine tools in a workflow

== Query, Explore, and Dashboards comparison

To help you choose the right tool for your task, you can use the following comparison:

[cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| Tool | Best for | Data scale | Requires Cypher?

| **Query**
| Developers, DBAs, data engineers
| Hundreds of nodes/relationships
| Yes

| **Explore**
| Business analysts, domain experts
| Thousands of nodes/relationships
| No (uses search phrases)

| **Dashboards**
| Stakeholders, executives, end users
| Aggregated metrics and summaries
| Created with Cypher, used without
|===

== How the tools fit together

====
A typical flow: use **Query** to develop and test Cypher, use **Explore** to validate and explore results visually or to create Perspectives, then use **Dashboards** to package insights for others.

The diagram summarizes who usually uses which tool and how they connect.

== How data type affects tool choice

Your data shape can steer you toward one tool or a combination.

**Highly connected data** (e.g. social networks, fraud detection):

* Use **Explore** to trace connections and spot patterns visually.
* Use **Query** when you need precise path-finding or algorithms.
* Use **Dashboards** for metrics like "average connections per user."

**Hierarchical data** (e.g. org charts, product catalogs):

* Use **Explore** to move through parent-child relationships visually.
* Use **Query** for recursive traversals and aggregations.
* Use **Dashboards** for tree summaries and counts.

**Time-series or transactional data** (e.g. logs, orders, events):

* Use **Query** for date-range filters and aggregations.
* Use **Dashboards** for trends and KPIs.
* Use **Explore** to drill into specific transactions or anomalies.

**Knowledge graphs** (e.g. recommendations, semantic data):

* Use **Explore** with Perspectives for business-friendly views.
* Use **Query** for complex inference or similarity search.
* Use **Dashboards** to surface recommendations to end users.

== Summary

In this lesson, youlearned when to use each Aura console tool:

* **Import tool** — Loading data and defining the graph model.
* **Query** — Developing and running Cypher; precise, repeatable results; best for hundreds of nodes.
* **Explore** — Visual exploration without Cypher; Perspectives and large result sets (thousands of nodes).
* **Dashboards** — Sharing curated, filterable views with stakeholders.

You also saw how data type (highly connected, hierarchical, time-series, knowledge graph) can guide which tool or combination to use.

In the next module, you will learn about operations, including shared responsibilities, security, and further learning resources.
