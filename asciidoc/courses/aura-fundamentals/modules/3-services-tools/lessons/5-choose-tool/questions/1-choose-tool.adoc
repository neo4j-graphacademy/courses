= Choosing the right tool

A stakeholder wants to view key metrics and filter by date without writing Cypher. Which tool should you use?

* [ ] Query tool — they can run Cypher in the editor
* [x] Explore tool — they can search and browse the graph
* [ ] Dashboards — build cards with Cypher and filters so they can change what they see without writing queries
* [ ] Import tool — load the metrics from CSV

The requirement is to *view* and *filter* predefined metrics, and the user should not need to write Cypher.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is **Explore**.

Explore is for visual exploration and search phrases; Query is for writing and running Cypher yourself; Dashboards are built for sharing curated views with stakeholders. You define the Cypher for each card and add filters (e.g., date range); users change filters to see different data without writing or editing queries. Import tool is for loading data into the graph.
