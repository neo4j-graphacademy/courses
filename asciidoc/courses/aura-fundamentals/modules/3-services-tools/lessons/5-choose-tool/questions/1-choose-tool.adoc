* [ ] Query tool — for writing and running Cypher in the editor

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is **Dashboards**.

Dashboards are built for sharing curated views with stakeholders. You define the Cypher for each card and add filters (e.g., date range); users change filters to see different data without writing or editing queries. Explore is for visual exploration and search phrases; Query is for writing and running Cypher yourself; Import tool is for loading data into the graph.
