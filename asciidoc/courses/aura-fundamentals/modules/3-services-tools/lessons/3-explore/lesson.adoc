== Exploring data visually

In the previous lesson, you learned how to query data using Cypher.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Connect to your Aura instance using the Explore tool
* Explore and visualize your data without writing Cypher
* Understand the differences between Query and Explore


[.slide]
== Quick introduction

The **Explore** tool is an interface for visualizing and exploring your graph data. It allows you to interact with your data in a more intuitive way, without needing to write Cypher queries. You can search for nodes and relationships, visualize them, and, if you have write access, edit the graph directly.


[.slide]
== Explore tool overview

The Explore tool provides visual graph exploration features. Use it to navigate your data without writing Cypher queries.

== Connecting

From the Aura console, either go to **Instances** and select the instance you want to connect to and use the **Connect** dropdown and select **Explore**, or directly to **Explore** and use the Connect button from there.

Before you do either, check that the data from the Import lesson has been loaded.

[.slide]

== Explore

Once connected, start exploring your data without writing any Cypher. The UI consists of a search bar, a scene where results are visualized, and a legend panel.
To get started:

* <click> in the searchbar

* <select> Person

* <select> Person name:value

* <select> Person name(equals):value

* <type> Tom Hanks

* <select> ACTED_IN

* <select> Movie

[.slide]
== Running a search

Use the **Run** button or press `Ctrl+Enter` to execute the search.

[.slide]
== Visualizing results

Results are visualized in the scene area. Interact with nodes and relationships by clicking and dragging them.

[NOTE]

You may have to zoom in a bit before the details are shown.

Notice that your styling choices are kept between runs and can even be shared with other users, using the **Perspectives** feature.

== Query and Explore tools

The **Explore** tool is designed for users who prefer a visual approach or are not familiar with Cypher syntax:

[.slide]
== Features of the Explore tool

* **No Cypher knowledge required**: Explore your data without writing queries

* **Visual exploration**: Interact with your data visually to understand relationships and patterns

* **Editing capabilities**: Edit nodes and relationships directly in the graph view

* **Perspectives**: Create and share predefined views with specific search phrases and styling options


[.slide]
== Understanding Perspectives

Perspectives enable customized, shareable views of your graph data.

A Perspective defines:

* **Visual styling** - Colors, sizes, and icons for different node labels and relationship types
* **Search phrases** - Pre-built queries that users select from a menu instead of writing Cypher
* **Property visibility** - Which properties to display or hide for each node type
* **Category mappings** - How labels map to business-friendly names


[.slide]
=== Creating a Perspective

To create a Perspective:

1. Open the Explore tool and connect to your instance
2. Click the **Perspective** dropdown in the top toolbar
3. Select **Create new perspective** or edit an existing one
4. Configure styling, search phrases, and property visibility
5. Save and optionally share with your team


[.slide]
=== Search phrases in Perspectives

Search phrases are parametrized Cypher queries packaged as simple menu options. For example:

* "Find all movies by actor" - prompts for an actor name, runs the query
* "Show recent transactions over $1000" - pre-configured for fraud analysis
* "Display customer purchase history" - for e-commerce exploration

This allows business users to run complex queries without knowing Cypher. The Cypher knowledge is only needed once - when creating the search phrase.


[.slide]
=== Sharing Perspectives

Share Perspectives across your organization to ensure consistent data exploration:

* Export Perspectives as JSON files
* Import into other Explore instances
* All team members see the same styling and have access to the same search phrases

This creates a uniform experience and reduces the learning curve for new users.

[.slide]
== Key advantages

video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/explore-nodes.mp4["Explore Nodes",role="cdn", width=100%]

You can click on any node to see its relationships and connected nodes, enabling visual discovery of your graph data structure.

* Further exploration is possible from an initial set of results (via contextmenu on the nodes).

* Editing the graph is possible without knowing Cypher syntax (2).

* Customization is possible through the use of Perspectives and Scenes. This goes beyond mere styling and can include defined parametrized queries (3). Perspectives can be shared. This allows for a uniform experience in an organization.

* Whereas the **Query tool** is fit for maybe a few hundred nodes and relationships, **Explore** handles thousands.



== More information

The **Explore** tool lets you visualize and interact with your graph data.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to use the Explore tool to visually navigate your graph data without writing Cypher.

Key differences from the Query tool include visual exploration, direct graph editing, and Perspectives for sharing customized views.

In the next lesson, you will create dashboards to visualize your data for stakeholders.
