:order: 3

In the previous lesson, you learned how to query data in an Aura database.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Connect to your Aura instance using the integrated explore tool
* Explore and visualize your data without needing to write Cypher queries
* Understand the differences between the **Query Tool** and the **Explore Tool**

    
== Quick introduction

The **Explore** tool is a powerful interface for visualizing and exploring your graph data. It allows you to interact with your data in a more intuitive way, without needing to write Cypher queries. You can search for nodes and relationships, visualize them, and even edit the graph directly.

Before diving into the integrated explore tool, note that you can also use link:https://explore.neo4j.io[Neo4j Bloom^]. You connect to the instance using the credentials and carry on from there.

       

== Connecting
Open the Aura console and select the instance you want to connect to.

== Differences
The **Explore** tool is designed for users who may not be familiar with Cypher syntax or prefer a more visual approach to exploring their data. It provides several advantages over the **Query Tool**:
* **Visual exploration**: You can interact with your data visually, making it easier to understand relationships and patterns.
* Whereas the **query tool** is fit for maybe a few hundred nodes and relationships, **explore** can easily manage thousands.
