How do you allow users to dynamically change which data is displayed in a dashboard without modifying the underlying queries?

* [ ] Create multiple dashboard cards for each data variation
* [ ] Use the AI generation feature to update queries
* [ ] Edit the card each time different data is needed

.Solution
====
The correct answer is **Add filters that use parameters in your Cypher queries**.

Filters allow users to dynamically change what data is displayed without modifying queries. Create a filter (e.g., "Person selection"), then update your card's Cypher query to use the filter parameter (e.g., `WHERE p.name = $person_name`). Users select values from the filter, and the dashboard updates automatically.
