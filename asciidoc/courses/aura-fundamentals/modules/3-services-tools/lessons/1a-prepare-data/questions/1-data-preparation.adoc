[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Unique identifiers exist for each entity (like movieId, personId).**

Unique identifiers (like movieId for movies, personId for actors) ensure that each entity becomes a single node in the graph. Without unique identifiers, you might create duplicate nodes or cause import errors.
