:slides: true

In the previous lesson, you learned how to connect to an Aura active database instance.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Use the integrated data importer tool in the Aura console
* Model your data for import
* Import data into your Aura instance

== Data Source
Before you can add a **New data source** you need to have a data source file ready.

For the purpose of this lesson, you can use the sample movie data available at this link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/training/refs/heads/master/advanced_cypher/data/movies.csv[movies.csv, movies.csv, download=movies.csv] on your local machine.


Once you have downloaded that, you can click on **New data source** to add it to your Aura instance.

The data file you have downloaded is a .CSV file, so select **CSV** as the data source type.

Drop in the **movies.csv** file. This results in

== Model

You will learn how to model data **manually**.

First define the Movie nodes:

* Label **Movie**
* Map from table (csv file in this case), **movieId** and **title**

Now define the Person nodes.

* Add a blank node
* Label **Person**
* Map from table (csv file in this case), **personId** and **name**

Define the ACTED_IN relationship.

* Pull the relationship from the Person node to the Movie node.
* Relationship type **ACTED_IN**
* Node ID mapping should be automatic.
* Map from table (csv file in this case), **characters**

== Import
**Run import** is the next step, and it needs a connection to the database.

**Connect** and wait until the import is done.

image::images/01_data_importer_result.jpg[importer_result,width=450,align=center]

**Close** the result window and you will be back at the main data importer screen.

You can now see the imported data source in the list of data sources.

== Summary

In this lesson you imported data in an Aura instance using the integrated data importer tool, modeled the data, and ran the import.

In the next lesson, you will explore the integrated query tool to interact with your data and write Cypher queries.
