In the previous lesson, you learned how to connect to an Aura active database instance.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Use the integrated service  for importing data in the Aura console
* Model your data for import
* Import data into your Aura instance

[.slide]
== Data Importer service

[.slide]
   
== Data Source
Before you can add a **New data source** you need to have a data source file ready.

For the purpose of this lesson, you can use the sample movie data available at this link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/training/refs/heads/master/advanced_cypher/data/movies.csv[movies.csv, movies.csv, download=movies.csv] on your local machine.


Once you have downloaded that, you can add it to your Aura instance with **New data source**.

[.slide]
== Adding a data source
image::images/01_data_importer_source.jpg[importer_source,width=450,align=center]

The data file you have downloaded is a .CSV file, so select **CSV** as the data source type.
[.slide]
== Uploading the data file
image::images/01_data_importer_drop.jpg[importer_drop,width=200,align=center]

Drop in the **movies.csv** file. You can also use the **Upload CSV** button to browse and select the file from your local machine.

[.slide]
== Data Importer manual
Once the file is uploaded, you will see the Data Importer manual.

[.slide]

== Model
You can **upload** a data model or create one **manually**.
For the purpose of this example, you will create one manually.

[.slide]
== Defining the data model
First define the Movie nodes in the details panel:

video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/add-node-label.mp4["Add Node Label",role="cdn",  width=100%]

* Use the Label **Movie**
* Click on **Map from table** (csv file in this case), **movieId** and **title**

[.slide]
== Edit data model

// image::images/01_data_importer_model_movie.jpg[importer_movie,width=600,align=center]
[.slide]

== Upload CSV file
video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/upload-csv.mp4["Upload CSV",role="cdn",  width=100%]

Now add and define the Person nodes.

* Add a blank node using the **Add node label** button


Upload the CSV file by using the Drag and Drop area or the **Upload CSV** button.

[.slide]
== Define Person nodes
video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/add-node-label.mp4["Add Node Label",role="cdn", width=100%]


* Use the label **Person**
* Click **Map from table** (csv file in this case), **personId** and **name**

[.slide]
== Person node properties

[.slide]

== Edit Person properties
You can edit the properties of the nodes by clicking on the pencil icon next to each property: 

video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/edit-fields.mp4["Edit Fields",role="cdn",  width=100%]

[.slide]
== Define ACTED_IN relationship
Create and define the ACTED_IN relationship.

* Drag the relationship from the Person node to the Movie node using the plus-sign when you hover over the edge of the Person node.
* Name the relationship type as **ACTED_IN**.
* Node ID mapping should be automatic.
* Click on **Map from table** (csv file in this case), **characters**.

[.slide]

== ACTED_IN relationship properties

Note the green checkmark that indicates that an element has been mapped correctly.

[.slide]

== Analyse and confirm model parameters

Before Importing, you can analyse and edit the model parameters, as well as confirming the primary key of the nodes.

[.slide]

== Import
Use **Run import** to ingest the data. You will need to connect to the database.

[.slide]
== Connect to database
video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/run-import.mp4["Run Import",role="cdn", width=100%]

Once you have added the database credentials, click on **Connect** and wait until the import is done.

[.slide]
== Import summary
Once the import in complete, you will see a summary of the import results: 

video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/import-summary.mp4["Import Summary",role="cdn",  width=100%]

[.slide]
== Save data model
**Close** the result window and you will be back at the main data importer screen.

You can now see the imported data source in the list of data sources.

[.slide]
== Name data model
Give your data model a name, "Movies Model", and **Save** it.

== Summary

In this lesson you imported data in an Aura instance using the integrated data importer service, modeled the data, and ran the import.

In the next lesson, you will explore the integrated query tool to interact with your data and write Cypher queries.
