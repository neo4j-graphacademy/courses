.Solution
====
The correct order is **Upload CSV → Create model → Connect to database → Run import**.

1. **Upload CSV** - Add your data source file using "New data source"
2. **Create model** - Define nodes (like Person, Movie) and relationships (like ACTED_IN) with their properties
3. **Connect to database** - Select which instance to import into
4. **Run import** - Execute the import and verify the results
