= Import data

The data importer is not listed under **Tools** in the Aura console. It is our first port of call though. Quite pointless to look into data retrieval tools if you have no data in your database, right?

[NOTE]
====
The data importer is great to quickly start loading data. Do not confuse it with heavy duty ETL pipelines though. That's a whole training in and of itself!

== Data Source
Before you can add a **New data source** we first need to have one. Download link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/training/refs/heads/master/advanced_cypher/data/movies.csv[movies.csv, movies.csv, download=movies.csv] on your local machine.
If you have that, you can click the button.

And given that you downloaded a .CSV file the next click should be obvious too. A lot is going on on the next screen but there's again an obvious choice.

Drop in the **movies.csv** file. This results in

== Model

You can have fun with AI later, for now we'll do it **manually**.

image::images/01_data_importer_model_blank.jpg[importer_bank,width=600,align=center]

This is the blank starting model. First define the Movie nodes

* Label **Movie**
* Map from table (csv file in this case), **movieId** and **title**

Now define the Person nodes.

* Add a blank node
* Label **Person**
* Map from table (csv file in this case), **personId** and **name**

Define the ACTED_IN relationship.

* Pull the relationship from the Person node to the Movie node.
* Relationship type **ACTED_IN**
* Node ID mapping should be automatic.
* Map from table (csv file in this case), **characters**

== Import
**Run import** is the next obvious choice. But it does need a connection to the database.

image::images/01_data_importer_connect.jpg[importer_connect,width=450,align=center]

**Connect** and things will go automatically from there until the import is done.

**Close** for now. We'll have a look at the data in the next lessons.

[NOTE]
====
The **Connect** looked a bit too easy, didn't it? No credentials needed? In the (next) lesson on the  **Query Tool** this is explained in detail.

And that is that for the **Data Importer**. You should probably give the model a decent name as well.

These models can be reused they are linked to the project, not the instance!
