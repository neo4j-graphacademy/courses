= Explore data

Formerly known as **Neo4j Bloom**.
Currently fully integrated into the Aura console.

== Old way (is better?)
Before diving into the integrated explore tool, note that you can also use link:https://explore.neo4j.io[Neo4j Bloom^]. Same procedure as before, you connect to the instance using the credentials and carry on from there.

[NOTE]
====
**Same procedure as before** is of course a reference to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner_for_One[Dinner for One]. Enjoy!
