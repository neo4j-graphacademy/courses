:type: lesson
:order: 4

In the previous lessons, you learned how to manage your Aura instances and users.

In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze metrics in your Neo4j Aura instance.

You will learn how to:

* Access the metrics dashboard in the Aura console
* Understand the different metrics available
* Use metrics to monitor the performance and health of your Aura instance

== Accessing the Metrics Dashboard

In the Aura console, you can access a set of metrics to monitor the performance and health of your Aura instance: 

The list of metrics includes:
* CPU Usage - percentage of CPU being used by the database instance. High CPU usage can indicate that there are inefficient queries running.
* Memory Usage - percentage of memory being used by the database instance. High memory usage can indicate that there are inefficient queries running.
* Out of Memory Errors - number of times the database has run out of memory and had to terminate queries.
* Query Performance - average time taken to execute queries. Use this metric to establish a which queries are taking longer than expected, and optimize them.


To access the metrics dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Open the Aura console and select the instance you want to monitor.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on **Operations** > **Metrics** to open the metrics dashboard.
3. Use the top menu to navigate between different categories of metrics: 
* Resources: Monitor the resource usage of your Aura instance, including CPU and memory usage.
* Instance: View metrics specific to the database instance, such as uptime and availability.
* Database: Analyze database-level metrics, including query performance and index usage.
4. Use the various metrics available to monitor the performance and health of your Aura instance.
