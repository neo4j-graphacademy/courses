.Solution
====
The correct answer is **Metrics Reader**.

The Metrics Reader role allows users to view performance metrics and monitoring data for instances within a specific project without making any changes to the database or settings. 

Metrics Reader is ideal for data analysts who need to analyze metrics but do not require write access or the ability to manage users or settings.
