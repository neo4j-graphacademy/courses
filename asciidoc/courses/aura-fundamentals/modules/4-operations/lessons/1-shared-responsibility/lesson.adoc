In the previous lesson, you learned about Aura and how it differs from self-managed databases.

In this lesson, you will learn about the different responsibilities of Aura and its users.

Aura operates on a shared responsibility model, where Neo4j handles the operational aspects of the database while users focus on their applications and data. This model allows you to benefit from the power of Neo4j without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.


== Aura's Responsibilities

Aura is responsible for the following:

* **Infrastructure Management**: Aura manages the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking.
* **Database Maintenance**: Aura handles database maintenance tasks such as backups, updates, and scaling.
* **Security**: Aura provides security features such as encryption, access control, and compliance with industry standards.

== User Responsibilities

Users are responsible for the following:

* **Data Modeling**: Users must understand Neo4j's graph data model and model their data accordingly.
* **Application Development**: Users are responsible for developing applications that interact with the Neo4j database.
* **Monitoring and Optimization**: Users should monitor their database performance and optimize queries as needed.

By understanding these shared responsibilities, you can effectively manage your Neo4j Aura instances and build successful applications.



== User roles


In addition to the shared responsibilities, it's important to understand the different user roles within an Aura organization:

* **Organisation Admin**: Has full access to all projects and instances within the organization. Can manage users, billing, and organization settings. You get this role when you create a new Aura account.
* **Project Admin**: Has full access to all instances within a specific project. Can manage users and project settings.
* **Project Member**: Has read and write access to instances within a specific project but cannot manage users or settings.
* **Project Viewer**: Has read-only access to instances within a specific project. Cannot make any changes to the database or settings.
* **Metrics Reader**: Has access to view performance metrics and monitoring data for instances within a specific project. Cannot make any changes to the database or settings.
