The correct answer is **Aura Business Critical and Virtual Dedicated Cloud**.

**AuraDB Free** has no SLA, and **AuraDB Professional** has best-effort support without a formal SLA. Only Business Critical and Virtual Dedicated Cloud tiers offer the 99.95% uptime guarantee with service credits (10% for 99.0-99.95% uptime, 25% for below 99.0%).
