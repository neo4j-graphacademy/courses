In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Understand the four AuraDB tiers and their target use cases
* Compare features across tiers (storage, backups, availability)
* Select the right tier for your project

== Choosing the right tier

AuraDB offers four tiers, each designed for different stages of development:

* **Free**: Learning and experimentation
* **Professional**: Production apps with moderate requirements
* **Business Critical**: Enterprise apps requiring high availability
* **Virtual Dedicated Cloud**: Strict compliance and security needs


[.slide]

* **Limits**: Up to 200,000 nodes and 400,000 relationships
* **Cloud provider**: GCP (us-central1 only)
* **Backups**: On-demand snapshots only
* **Auto-pause**: After 72 hours of inactivity

== AuraDB Professional

**AuraDB Professional** is for when you need more storage, cloud provider choice, and daily backups, but don't require high availability.

* **Storage**: Flexible sizing based on your needs

* **Backups**: Daily snapshots, retained for 7 days
* **Pause control**: Manual pause/resume
