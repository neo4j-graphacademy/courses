= Aura Tiers
:table-caption!:

In the previous lesson, you learned about Neo4j Aura and how it differs from self-managed Neo4j databases.

In this lesson, you will learn about the different Aura tiers available and how to select the right tier for your specific use case.

== Selecting the right tier

Neo4j Aura offers four different tiers, each designed for different stages of your project development and business needs.

**Aura Free** is designed for experimentation and learning.

You can use Aura Free when your graph has fewer than 200,000 nodes and fewer than 400,000 relationships, and you don't need high availability.

This tier costs nothing and gives you a way to test Neo4j without any financial commitment.

**Aura Professional** is designed for production applications with moderate requirements.

You can use Aura Professional when you need more storage space, want to choose your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure), and need daily backups for peace of mind.

This tier requires payment but still uses a single instance architecture.

**Aura Business Critical** is designed for enterprise applications that require high availability.

You can use Aura Business Critical when you need guaranteed uptime, role-based access control (RBAC), single sign-on (SSO), and hourly backups.

This tier provides a multi-availability zone cluster architecture for maximum reliability.

**Aura Virtual Dedicated Cloud** is designed for applications with strict compliance and security requirements.

You can use Aura Virtual Dedicated Cloud when you need dedicated infrastructure, customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK), and VPC isolation.

This tier provides the highest level of security and compliance features.

== Comparing tier features

The table below compares the key features across all four Aura tiers:

[NOTE]
====
* **ACU** - Aura Consumption Unit
* **CMEK** - Customer Managed Encryption Keys
* **PAYG** - Pay As You Go
* **RBAC** - Role Based Access Control
* **SSO** - Single Sign-On
* Instance size refers to **RAM**
* The main difference between **Business Critical** and **Aura Virtual Dedicated Cloud** is that the latter comes with VPC isolation and dedicated infrastructure.
* **SLA** - Service Level Agreement. Note that the 99.95% corresponds to that of what the cloud platforms themselves guarantee. So higher is currently not possible.
