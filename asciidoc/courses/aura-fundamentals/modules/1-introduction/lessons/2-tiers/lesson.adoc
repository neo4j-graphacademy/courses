[.slide]
== Aura Free

**Aura Free** is designed for experimentation and learning.

Use Aura Free when your graph has fewer than 200,000 nodes and fewer than 400,000 relationships, and you don't need high availability.

This tier gives you a way to test Neo4j without any financial commitment.


[.slide]
== Aura Professional

**Aura Professional** is designed for production applications with moderate requirements.

Use Aura Professional when you need more storage space, want to choose your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure), and need daily backups, but not high availability.


[.slide]
== Aura Business Critical

**Aura Business Critical** is designed for enterprise applications that require high availability.

Use Aura Business Critical when you need guaranteed uptime, role-based access control (RBAC), single sign-on (SSO), and hourly backups.

This tier provides a multi-availability zone cluster architecture for maximum reliability, and requires payment as well.


[.slide]
== Aura Virtual Dedicated Cloud

**Aura Virtual Dedicated Cloud** is designed for applications with strict compliance and security requirements.

Use Aura Virtual Dedicated Cloud when you need dedicated infrastructure, customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK), and VPC isolation.

This tier provides the highest level of security and compliance features.

For a detailed comparison of all tiers, see the link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/#graph-database[Neo4j Aura pricing page^] and the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/getting-started/create-instance/[instance creation documentation^].
