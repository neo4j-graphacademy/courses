= Understanding costs
:type: lesson
:order: 3
:slides: true

In the previous lesson, you learned about the different tiers available on Neo4j Aura and how to select the right tier for your specific use case.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Explore the cost structure of Neo4j Aura
* Understand what's included in Aura pricing beyond compute resources
* Manage costs effectively through pausing and right-sizing instances

[.slide]
== The cost structure

When considering Neo4j Aura, it's essential to understand what you're actually paying for. The cost of using Aura includes a range of services and capabilities that would require significant effort to implement and maintain in a self-managed setup:

* **Compute resources**: The virtual machines running your database instances.
* **Storage**: The disk space used for your database, including indexes and logs.
* **Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery options.
* **Monitoring and metrics**: Advanced monitoring capabilities to track performance and health.
* **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control (RBAC), and network isolation.
* **Updates and maintenance**: Automatic updates to ensure you're running the latest and most secure version of Neo4j.
* **Support**: Access to Neo4j support services, depending on your tier.


[NOTE]
.Important considerations
====
Neo4j Community edition requires that you abide by the GPL v3 license.

The Enterprise Edition software does have Role Based Access Control (RBAC) but the Aura Professional tier is limited in that respect.

Neo4j Community Edition only allows a dump/load of the database. The database has to be stopped for that operation.

[.slide]
== Optimizing costs across tiers

For each tier, there are specific cost differences to consider:

* A cluster is going to be more expensive than a single instance
* Dedicated infrastructure is more expensive than shared infrastructure
* Hourly backups require more storage than daily backups
* Vector indexes are very storage and memory intensive


[.slide]
== Managing costs best practices

To effectively manage costs in Neo4j Aura, consider the following best practices:

* **Instance sizing**: Choose the right instance size based on your workload requirements. Avoid over-provisioning resources, since you can always scale up if needed.
* **Right-tier selection**: Select the appropriate tier based on your application's needs. For example, use Aura Free for development and testing, and Aura Professional or Business Critical for production workloads.
* **Pausing instances**: Use the pause feature to stop incurring costs when instances are not in use, especially for development and testing environments.

[.slide]
== Managing costs through pausing

One of the most direct ways to control costs is by pausing instances when they're not in use.

For example, if you have a development instance that is only used during business hours, you can pause it overnight and on weekends to save costs.

By default, **Aura Free** instances are automatically paused after 72 hours of inactivity, while **Aura Professional**, **Business Critical**, and **Virtual Dedicated Cloud** instances can be manually paused.

[.slide]
=== Understanding pause behavior

Pausing an instance is - in all cases - a cost-saving decision. 

This behavior differs by tier:

**Aura Free** instances:

* Cannot be manually paused
* Auto-pause after 72 hours of inactivity  
* Deleted after 30 days of being paused

**Aura Professional / Business Critical / Virtual Dedicated Cloud** instances:

* Can be manually paused
* Are not auto-paused when inactive
* Automatically resumed after 30 days of pausing

Associate pausing to putting your instance into hibernation - it stops consuming resources (and costs) but can be quickly awakened when needed.

[.slide]
=== When to pause instances

Consider pausing instances in these scenarios:

* Development environments during off-hours
* Testing environments between testing cycles
* Staging environments when not actively used
* Temporary instances for specific projects

[WARNING]
.Coordinate before pausing
====
Pausing stops all database activity, so coordinate with your team before pausing shared instances.

== Making informed decisions

The following are some key takeaways to help you make informed decisions about using Aura:


* Size your instances correctly
* Pick the correct Aura tier for your use case requirements
* Commitment can save in the long run
* Understand the full cost of self-managed alternatives, including maintenance and operational overhead
* Use pausing to control costs for development and testing environments

By understanding these cost factors, you can effectively manage your Neo4j Aura instances and build successful applications while keeping expenses in check.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about what makes up the cost of Aura.

You learned practical cost management techniques, particularly how to use pausing to control costs for development and testing environments.

In the next module, you'll learn about database lifecycle management, including backup and restore operations.
