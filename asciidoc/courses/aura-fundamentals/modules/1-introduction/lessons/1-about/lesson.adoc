== Welcome to AuraDB Fundamentals

Welcome to the AuraDB Fundamentals course on GraphAcademy!

**Your mission:** Build a movie recommendation engine that finds connections between actors, directors, and films. This is the same pattern used by streaming services to suggest content based on viewing history and preferences.

**Why graphs for recommendations?** Recommendation engines need to traverse relationships quickly: "Users who liked Movie A also liked Movie B" or "Actors who worked together tend to appear in similar genres." Graph databases excel at finding these connections through relationship traversal, making them ideal for recommendation systems.

**What you'll build:** By the end of this course, you'll have a working system that can find movies by the same actors, discover actors who frequently work together, and identify similar movies based on shared cast members.

Before diving in, it's important to understand where AuraDB fits within Neo4j's cloud offerings and why it's the right choice for your recommendation engine.

== Where does AuraDB fit in?

[.col]
====
**Neo4j Aura** is a fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) where Neo4j manages the cloud infrastructure on your chosen provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure). Aura offers two products:

* **AuraDB** — A managed graph database for transactional workloads (OLTP). This course focuses on AuraDB.

* **AuraDS** — A managed environment for graph data science, including graph algorithms and machine learning pipelines.

**Understanding OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):**

OLTP stands for **Online Transaction Processing**. It refers to database systems optimized for handling many small, fast transactions in real-time. For your recommendation engine, OLTP means:

* **Fast reads and writes**: When a user requests movie recommendations, the database quickly traverses relationships to find similar movies
* **Concurrent operations**: Multiple users can query recommendations simultaneously without blocking each other
* **ACID compliance**: Each recommendation query is atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable—ensuring data integrity
* **Real-time responses**: Queries return results in milliseconds, which is essential for interactive recommendation systems

**OLTP vs. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):**

* **AuraDB (OLTP)**: Optimized for transactional workloads like your recommendation engine—fast relationship traversal, real-time queries, and concurrent user access
* **AuraDS (OLAP)**: Optimized for analytical workloads—running graph algorithms, machine learning pipelines, and batch analysis on large datasets

For recommendation engines, you typically use AuraDB (OLTP) because recommendations need to be fast and real-time. If you later want to analyze recommendation patterns across your entire dataset (e.g., "Which actors appear most frequently together?"), you might use AuraDS for that analytical work.

== What is AuraDB?

AuraDB is a cloud hosted Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) for graph databases. Neo4j manages the underlying infrastructure—servers, storage, networking, backups, and security patches—while you interact with the database through the Aura Console or your application code.

**Why AuraDB for your recommendation engine?** 

* **Focus on your data, not infrastructure**: Instead of configuring servers, you'll spend time building queries that find movie recommendations
* **Automatic scaling**: As your movie dataset grows, AuraDB handles the infrastructure scaling automatically
* **Built for relationship traversal**: AuraDB is optimized for the exact pattern your recommendation engine needs—finding paths through actor-movie relationships
* **Zero maintenance**: No need to patch servers or manage backups manually—you can focus on improving your recommendation algorithms

== What happens when creating an instance

[.col]
====
When you create an Aura instance for your recommendation engine, Neo4j provisions:

* **Load Balancer**: Routes recommendation queries from your application to the database. When a user asks "What movies are similar to The Matrix?", the load balancer ensures the query reaches an available database instance.

* **Compute & Storage**: Cloud resources allocated based on your selected size. For a movie recommendation engine, you need enough memory to hold your graph in RAM for fast traversal, and storage for all the actor-movie relationships.

* **Backups**: Automatic snapshots at intervals determined by your tier. If you accidentally delete movie data or need to restore to a previous state, backups protect your recommendation engine's data.

* **Security**: TLS encryption ensures recommendation queries and results are encrypted in transit. Access controls prevent unauthorized access to your movie data.

**How it works in the background:** 

When you create an instance, Neo4j's automation:

1. Provisions cloud resources (compute, storage, networking) on your chosen provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
2. Installs and configures Neo4j with optimal settings for graph workloads
3. Sets up monitoring and logging systems
4. Configures automatic backups based on your tier

This provisioning typically completes in under a minute, so you can start loading your movie data quickly.

== When to use AuraDB vs. self-managed Neo4j

AuraDB is well-suited for learning, prototyping, and production workloads where you prefer not to manage infrastructure. Think of it like renting an apartment vs. owning a house—you trade infrastructure management for convenience.

**For your recommendation engine:** AuraDB lets you focus on building recommendation algorithms and queries rather than managing servers. This is especially valuable when you're learning how graph databases work for recommendation systems.

* **Infrastructure**: Fully managed service with zero maintenance required from your side.

* **Service Level Agreements**: 99.95% uptime SLA with fault tolerance and high availability (Business Critical and VDC tiers). See the link:https://neo4j.com/legal-terms/neo4j-sla/[Neo4j SLA^] for details.

* **High Availability**: Architecture varies by tier:
** **Free and Professional**: Single instance deployment
** **Business Critical**: Multi-availability zone cluster with automatic failover
** **Virtual Dedicated Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure with cluster architecture

* **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation, and access controls.

* **Backups**: Automated backups with tier-specific schedules:
** **Free**: On-demand snapshots only (hourly limit), latest snapshot retained
** **Professional**: Daily scheduled snapshots, retained for 7 days
** **Business Critical**: Hourly snapshots, retained for 30 days
** **Virtual Dedicated Cloud**: Hourly snapshots, retained for 60 days

* **Updates**: Aura handles all software updates and patches, ensuring you always run the latest and most secure version of Neo4j.

For more details, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/[Neo4j Aura documentation^].

== What's next

In the next lesson, you'll explore the four AuraDB tiers—Free, Professional, Business Critical, and Virtual Dedicated Cloud—and learn which one fits your use case.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned:

* **Neo4j Aura** is a fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) where Neo4j manages the cloud infrastructure, offering two products: AuraDB (transactional databases) and AuraDS (data science)
* **AuraDB** is a fully managed graph database service where Neo4j handles infrastructure, backups, security, and updates
* **Different tiers** provide different architectures: single instance (Free, Professional) vs. multi-AZ clusters (Business Critical, VDC)
* **Backup frequency and retention** vary by tier

In the next lesson, you'll examine the different AuraDB tiers and their specifications to determine which fits your use case.
