Welcome to the Aura Fundamentals course on GraphAcademy. Throughout this course, you will learn all about Neo4j Aura, a fully managed cloud database service that allows you to run multiple Neo4j instances. Aura handles the infrastructure management so you can focus on your applications. 


== Understanding Neo4j Aura

Neo4j Aura is Neo4j's Database-as-a-Service offering. Instead of managing the database infrastructure yourself, Neo4j manages it for you in the cloud, so you can focus on your business applications and data insights.

In simple terms: "Aura is Neo4j that someone else runs for you."

== Comparing self-managed Neo4j with Aura

The key difference lies in who handles the operational responsibilities. With Aura, we handle everything so you can concentrate on building your application:

* **Infrastructure**: We manage the cloud infrastructure so you can deploy your database in your preferred cloud provider (GCP, AWS, Azure)
* **Service Level Agreements**: We ensure your database meets performance and availability targets
* **High Availability**: We maintain redundant systems to keep your database running
* **Security**: We handle encryption and security measures
* **Backups**: We automatically backup your data and manage disaster recovery
* **Updates**: We handle patches and upgrades to keep your database up to date with the latest version

This separation allows you to concentrate on building applications and analyzing data while Neo4j handles the database operations, monitoring, and maintenance.
