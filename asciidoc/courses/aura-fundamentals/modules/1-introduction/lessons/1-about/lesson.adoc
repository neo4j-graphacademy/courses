== Welcome to AuraDB Fundamentals

Welcome to the AuraDB Fundamentals course on GraphAcademy.

In this course, you'll set up a Neo4j graph database in the cloud, load it with movie data, and write queries that traverse relationships between actors, directors, and films. This is the same pattern that recommendation engines use to find connections in data.

Before diving in, it's important to understand where AuraDB fits within Neo4j's cloud offerings.

== Where does AuraDB fit in?

[.col]
====
**Neo4j Aura** is Neo4j's cloud platform. It offers two distinct products:

* **AuraDB** — A fully managed graph database for transactional workloads (OLTP). This is what you'll use in this course.

* **AuraDS** — A managed environment for graph data science, including graph algorithms and machine learning pipelines.

This course focuses exclusively on AuraDB.

== What is AuraDB?

AuraDB is a Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) for graph databases. Neo4j manages the underlying infrastructure—servers, storage, networking, backups, and security patches—while you interact with the database through the Aura Console or your application code.

The tradeoff: you give up some configuration flexibility in exchange for not having to maintain the infrastructure yourself.

== What happens when creating an instance

[.col]
====
When you create an Aura instance, Neo4j provisions:

* **Load Balancer**: Routes queries from your application to the database
* **Compute & Storage**: Cloud resources allocated based on your selected size
* **Backups**: Automatic snapshots at intervals determined by your tier
* **Security**: TLS encryption, access controls, and monitoring

This provisioning typically completes in under a minute.

== When to use AuraDB vs. self-managed Neo4j

AuraDB is well-suited for learning, prototyping, and production workloads where you prefer not to manage infrastructure. Think of it like renting an apartment vs. owning a house—you trade customization for convenience.

* **Infrastructure**: Fully managed service with zero maintenance required from your side.

* **Service Level Agreements**: 99.95% uptime SLA with fault tolerance and high availability (Business Critical and VDC tiers). See the link:https://neo4j.com/legal-terms/neo4j-sla/[Neo4j SLA^] for details.

* **High Availability**: Architecture varies by tier:
** **Free and Professional**: Single instance deployment
** **Business Critical**: Multi-availability zone cluster with automatic failover
** **Virtual Dedicated Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure with cluster architecture

* **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation, and access controls.

* **Backups**: Automated backups with tier-specific schedules:
** **Free**: On-demand snapshots only (hourly limit), latest snapshot retained
** **Professional**: Daily scheduled snapshots, retained for 7 days
** **Business Critical**: Hourly snapshots, retained for 30 days
** **Virtual Dedicated Cloud**: Hourly snapshots, retained for 60 days

* **Updates**: Aura handles all software updates and patches, ensuring you always run the latest and most secure version of Neo4j.

For more details, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/[Neo4j Aura documentation^].

== What's next

In the next lesson, you'll explore the four AuraDB tiers—Free, Professional, Business Critical, and Virtual Dedicated Cloud—and learn which one fits your use case.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned:

* **Neo4j Aura** is Neo4j's cloud platform, offering two products: AuraDB (transactional databases) and AuraDS (data science)
* **AuraDB** is a fully managed graph database service where Neo4j handles infrastructure, backups, security, and updates
* **Different tiers** provide different architectures: single instance (Free, Professional) vs. multi-AZ clusters (Business Critical, VDC)
* **Backup frequency and retention** vary by tier

In the next lesson, you'll examine the different AuraDB tiers and their specifications to determine which fits your use case.
