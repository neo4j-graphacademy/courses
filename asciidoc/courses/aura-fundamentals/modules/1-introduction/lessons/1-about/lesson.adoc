== Understanding Neo4j Aura

Welcome to the Aura Fundamentals course on GraphAcademy!

Throughout this course, you will learn how to get started with Neo4j Aura.

Aura provides a fully managed Neo4j database service that allows you to run multiple instances in the cloud, while handling the underlying infrastructure, maintenance, and operations.

== Understanding Neo4j Aura

Aura provides a fully managed Neo4j database service (DBaaS), which means you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure, maintenance, or operations.

It provides all the Neo4j features you know and like from self-managed deployments, with the bonus benefit of being a cloud service.

The diagram shows what happens behind the scenes when you use Neo4j Aura:

* Your applications connect through a load balancer
* Neo4j manages all infrastructure, monitoring, and security
* Data is stored on persistent cloud storage
* Backups run automatically based on your tier

== Comparing self-managed Neo4j with Aura

The key difference lies in who handles the operational responsibilities. With Aura, Neo4j handles everything so you can concentrate on building your application:

* **Infrastructure**: Fully managed service with zero maintenance required from your side.

* **Service Level Agreements**: 99.95% uptime SLA with fault tolerance and high availability (Business Critical and VDC tiers). See the link:https://neo4j.com/legal-terms/neo4j-sla/[Neo4j SLA^] for details.

* **High Availability**: Architecture varies by tier:
** **Free and Professional**: Single instance deployment
** **Business Critical**: Multi-availability zone cluster with automatic failover
** **Virtual Dedicated Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure with cluster architecture

* **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation, and access controls.

* **Backups**: Automated backups with tier-specific schedules:
** **Free**: On-demand snapshots only (hourly limit), latest snapshot retained
** **Professional**: Daily scheduled snapshots, retained for 7 days
** **Business Critical**: Hourly snapshots, retained for 30 days
** **Virtual Dedicated Cloud**: Hourly snapshots, retained for 60 days

* **Updates**: Aura handles all software updates and patches, ensuring you always run the latest and most secure version of Neo4j.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned what Neo4j Aura is and how it compares to self-managed Neo4j databases. Key takeaways include:

* Aura is a fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) that handles infrastructure, backups, security, and updates
* Different tiers offer different architectures: single instance (Free, Professional) vs. multi-availability zone clusters (Business Critical, VDC)
* Backup frequency and retention vary by tier

In the next lesson, you will learn about the different Aura tiers and how to select the right one for your use case.
