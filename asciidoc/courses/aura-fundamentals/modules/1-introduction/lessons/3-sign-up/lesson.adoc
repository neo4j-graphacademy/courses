== Signing up for Aura
Signing up for Neo4j Aura is a straightforward process that allows you to get started with a fully managed graph database in the cloud.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Create a Neo4j Aura account
* Set up your first Aura Professional instance (recommended)

[NOTE]
.Using the Professional tier
====
While Aura offers a Free tier for experimentation, this course recommends starting with **Aura Professional** to access the full feature set. Professional includes a 14-day free trial, so you can explore all capabilities without upfront costs.
====

[.slide]
== Step 1: Visit the Neo4j Aura Website

Go to link:https://console.neo4j.io[console.neo4j.io^] in your web browser. This is the official portal for managing Neo4j Aura databases.

On this page, you will see options to sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.

Use the **Sign Up** button to create a new account.

== Step 2: Create Your Account

After clicking the **Sign Up** button, you will be directed to the registration form. After filling in your email address, you have to confirm your identity before proceeding to make sure it is a valid email address and not a bot or impersonation.

[.slide]
== Step 2b: Create a password
Once your email is verified, you will be prompted to create a password:

[.slide]
== Step 2c: Onboarding

After setting up your password, you will be asked to provide some additional information, such as your name and company (if applicable). Fill in the required fields and click **Next**.

[.slide]
== Step 3: Personalize Your Experience

After creating your account, you will be prompted to personalize your experience by selecting your interests and how you plan to use Neo4j Aura. This helps Neo4j tailor the experience to your needs.

After choosing your role, you will be asked to select your goals in Neo4j Aura, such as: Building an application, analyze data using graphs, learning Neo4j, or other options.

video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/sign-up-preferences.mp4["Sign up preferences", role="cdn", width=100%]

As you select your interests, you will see a graph getting built indicating how far along you are in the setup process, instead of a progress bar. Once you have made your selections, click **Next** to proceed.

[.slide]
== Choosing the right location

When creating a new database instance, you need to choose the right location for your instance.

For most Aura tiers, you can choose from multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and regions within those providers.

video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-fundamentals/choose-cloud-provider.mp4["Choose cloud provider", role="cdn", width=100%]
[.slide]
== Considering location factors
You should consider the following questions:

1. Where is your application running / going to run?
2. What cloud provider do / did you pick for your application?
3. Can you mirror the choices of the first two questions for your database?


If your application is hosted on AWS in the same region, you should choose the same region for your database instance to minimize latency and ensure optimal performance, as well as data security and compliance.

[.slide]
== Step 4: Set Up Your First Aura Professional Instance

After setting up your account, you will be directed to the region and cloud provider selection page. We recommend starting with **Aura Professional** to access the complete feature set.

Aura Professional includes:

* **Cloud provider choice**: Deploy on AWS, GCP, or Azure
* **Region selection**: Choose from multiple geographic regions to minimize latency
* **Flexible sizing**: Scale memory and storage based on your workload
* **Daily automated backups**: Restore your database to any point within the retention period
* **Pause/resume**: Stop incurring costs when your instance is not in use
* **Full API access**: Automate instance management programmatically

Click **Start 14 days free trial** to begin with Professional:

== Understanding size requirements

When sizing a graph database, except for Aura Free, you need to consider two main components:

* **Storage size** needs to be large enough to store all your nodes and relationships on disk, including their properties and any indexes.

* **Memory size** needs to accommodate both your data and the transaction workload (Java heap space for query processing).

To determine the right size, you need to know the following about your database:

* How many nodes and relationships?
* How many properties in the nodes and relationships?
* What type of data is stored as properties? (numbers, strings, etc.)
* How many indexes are required?
* Do you need to make use of any vector indexes?

[.slide]
== Estimating size requirements


Unless all this information is available, the best you can do is an estimate.
This is less of a problem for Aura as database instances can be resized through the Aura console with a few clicks.

For most Aura tiers, you must pick **memory size** (RAM) and **memory / storage ratio (1/2, 1/4, 1/8)**.

image::images/02_size_choice.jpg[size,width=600,align=center]

[.slide.discrete]
== A worked example

For example, if you pick 2GB memory, this corresponds to 4GB storage.
You can increase the storage to 8GB (1/4) or 16GB (1/8) at additional cost.

For **Aura Free**, size choices are hidden from you, but the database limits (200,000 nodes and 400,000 relationships) typically need between 3GB and 4GB of storage.

== Downloading credentials

After this, you will be presented with a set of credentials, that would be needed to connect to your database. Make sure to save these credentials in a secure location, as you will need them to access your database later.

[.slide]
== Step 5: Access your Professional Aura Instance

Once your instance is set up, you can access it through the Neo4j Aura console. From here, you can manage your database, run queries, and monitor performance:

[.slide]
== Professional instance landing page
Once you have completed the setup, you will be directed to the Aura console, where you can see your Getting Started page for your new Aura Professional instance:

[.slide]
== Alternative: Free Tier Setup

If you chose the Free tier instead of Professional, here's what to expect.

The Free tier provides a fixed configuration:

* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in us-central1 region only
* Maximum 200,000 nodes and 400,000 relationships
* On-demand backups (hourly limit)
* Automatic pause after 72 hours of inactivity

To access the Free tier, click "Select another instance" on the region selection page:

[.slide]
== Selecting the Free tier
Select **Free** from the tier list:

Your Free instance runs continuously until you delete it:

[TIP]
.Upgrade from Free to Professional
====
You can upgrade from Free to Professional at any time through the Aura console to unlock cloud provider choice, flexible sizing, and daily backups.

[.summary]
== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to sign up for a Neo4j Aura account and set up your first Aura Professional instance. Professional provides cloud provider choice, flexible sizing, daily backups, and pause/resume capabilities - all accessible through a 14-day free trial.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to create and manage an Aura instance, as well as how to connect to an existing one.
