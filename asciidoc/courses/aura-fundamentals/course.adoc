== Your Mission: Build a Movie Recommendation Engine

In this course, you'll build a movie recommendation engine that finds connections between actors, directors, and films. This is the same pattern used by streaming services like Netflix and Hulu to suggest content based on viewing history and preferences.

**Why graphs for recommendations?** Recommendation engines need to traverse relationships: "Users who liked Movie A also liked Movie B" or "Actors who worked together tend to appear in similar genres." Graph databases excel at finding these connections through relationship traversal.

**What you'll build:** By the end of this course, you'll have a working recommendation system that can:
* Find movies by the same actors or directors
* Discover actors who frequently work together
* Identify similar movies based on shared cast members
* Visualize the connections between people and films

**How AuraDB fits in:** Neo4j AuraDB is a fully managed graph database service in the cloud. Neo4j handles infrastructure—servers, backups, security patches, and scaling—so you can focus on building your recommendation engine.

By the end of this course, you'll have:

* A running AuraDB instance in the cloud
* Movie and actor data loaded via the Data Importer
* Cypher queries that find recommendations by traversing relationships
* Dashboards visualizing actor-movie connections for your recommendation engine

== Duration

1 hour

== Prerequisites

Basic familiarity with databases is helpful but not required.

If you're new to graph databases, the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals course^] covers nodes, relationships, and properties—the building blocks you'll work with here.

== What you will learn

Throughout this course, every step connects to building your recommendation engine:

* **Set up your infrastructure**: Sign up for Neo4j Aura and create an AuraDB instance optimized for your movie dataset
* **Load your data**: Import movie and actor data using the Data Importer, modeling relationships that power recommendations
* **Query for recommendations**: Write Cypher queries that traverse relationships to find similar movies, co-actors, and shared directors
* **Explore connections visually**: Navigate your graph using the Explore tool to discover recommendation patterns
* **Visualize insights**: Build dashboards showing actor networks, movie clusters, and recommendation metrics
* **Operate your system**: Manage backups, optimize costs, and scale your instance as your recommendation engine grows
