== Welcome to AuraDB Fundamentals

In this course, you will learn how to use Neo4j AuraDB, a fully managed graph database service in the cloud. Neo4j handles infrastructure—servers, backups, security patches, and scaling—so you can focus on working with your graph data.

**What is AuraDB?** AuraDB is a fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) where Neo4j manages the cloud infrastructure on your chosen provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure). You get a production-ready graph database without managing infrastructure.

Throughout this course, you will use the Movies dataset as an example to practice AuraDB features. The Movies dataset contains movies, actors, directors, and relationships between them—making it ideal for learning graph database concepts. The focus is on learning AuraDB capabilities, not on building a recommendation system.

== What you will learn

This course covers:

* **Set up your infrastructure**: Sign up for Neo4j Aura and create an AuraDB instance
* **Load your data**: Import data using the Data Importer tool, mapping CSV data to graph nodes and relationships
* **Query your data**: Write Cypher queries to retrieve and filter data from your graph
* **Explore connections visually**: Navigate your graph using the Explore tool to discover relationships and patterns
* **Visualize insights**: Build dashboards to visualize your graph data
* **Operate your instance**: Manage backups, optimize costs, and understand instance lifecycle

== Duration

1 hour

== Prerequisites

Basic familiarity with databases is helpful but not required.

If you're new to graph databases, the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals course^] covers nodes, relationships, and properties—the building blocks you'll work with here.
