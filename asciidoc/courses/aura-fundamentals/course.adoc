Neo4j Aura is Neo4j's cloud platform, offering two products: **AuraDB** for transactional graph databases and **AuraDS** for graph data science workloads. This course focuses on AuraDB.

AuraDB is a fully managed graph database service. Neo4j handles the infrastructure—servers, backups, security patches, and scaling—while you focus on your data and queries.

By the end of this course, you'll have:

* A running AuraDB instance in the cloud
* Movie and actor data loaded via the Data Importer
* Cypher queries that traverse relationships between entities
* Dashboards visualizing your graph data

== Duration

1 hour

== Prerequisites

Basic familiarity with databases is helpful but not required.

If you're new to graph databases, the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals course^] covers nodes, relationships, and properties—the building blocks you'll work with here.

== What you will learn

* Sign up for Neo4j Aura and create an AuraDB instance
* Load movie and actor data using the Data Importer
* Write Cypher queries to traverse relationships (e.g., find actors who worked with Tom Hanks)
* Navigate your graph visually using the Explore tool
* Build dashboards to visualize query results
* Manage backups, costs, and instance lifecycle
