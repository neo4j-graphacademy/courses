= The `movie` domain
:order: 6
:type: lesson
:sandbox: true

Up until now, you have been gathering skills needed to create your own Spring Data Neo4j application - discussing the SDN library, testing the Neo4j database connection, and understanding how domains are modeled and used with SDN.

In this lesson, you will get an overview of the data domain for the remainder of the course. You will also create your own graph data model and Java classes for the application domain model.

Let's get started!

== The `movie` application

In this course, you are creating an application to search for movies and actors or directors. You will also be able to add, update, and delete movies and people in the database.

Domain classes, repositories, and controllers will compose the application. The domain classes will model the data in the database. The repositories will read and write data to the database. Controllers will expose the data to the user.

== Domain overview

The domain for this course is a movie database. The database contains information about movies and people. People can be actors or directors, and you will also track the roles that actors play in movies.

Though there are a few other entities available in the database (such as genres and users), this course will focus on movies, people, and roles. The additional entities can be explored on your own.

A graph data model for this domain already exists because the sandbox instance you created earlier in the course has the data pre-loaded.

The `Actor` and `Director` nodes shown are extra labels on the `Person` nodes. `Person` nodes are a broader category that includes both actors and directors.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the application you will build for this course. You also looked at the graph data model for the movie data set.

Next, you will tackle creating the application domain model for our movie graph.
