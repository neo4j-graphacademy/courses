= The `movie` domain
:type: lesson

//possible video of this content? Congratulate user for understanding the information needed to build repeatable and maintainable SDN applications.
Up until now, we have set the stage for creating your own application - discussing the Spring Data Neo4j library, creating the application project, and understanding how domains are modeled and used in an SDN application.

In this lesson, you will get an overview of the data domain that we will be using for the remainder of the course. You will also create your own graph data model from it and create the Java classes for your application domain model.

Let's get started!

== Domain overview

The domain we will be using for this course is a movie database. The database contains information about movies and people. People can be actors or directors and we also want to track the roles that actors play in movies.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the application you will build for this course. You also created the graph data model and domain classes for the application.

In the next module, we will learn how to read data from Neo4j and write the application code to do so.
