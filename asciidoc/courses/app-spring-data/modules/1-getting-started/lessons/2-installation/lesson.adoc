:order: 2
:type: lesson

This lesson will ensure you have the right tools installed and configured in your development environment to work with the Spring Data Neo4j library.

== Steps

1. Verify your Java version. You will need Java 17 or higher. You can check your version by running the following command in your terminal window: +
`java -version`. To download the latest version of Java, go to https://adoptopenjdk.net.

2. An IDE of your choice. If you don't yet have a preference, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or Visual Studio Code are excellent choices. You can download IntelliJ from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download and VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

3. Optional: if you do not want to build the application locally, you can run the project from the browser using Gitpod. This will require a Gitpod account. You can sign up for a free account at https://gitpod.io.
