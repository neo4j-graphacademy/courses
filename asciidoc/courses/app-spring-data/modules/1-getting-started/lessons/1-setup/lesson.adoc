In order to build an application with Spring Data Neo4j and connect to a Neo4j database, you will need a few foundational skills. Then you will set up the tools needed to work with the Spring Data Neo4j library.

== Prerequisites

1. Be able to write Java programs. While you can use Spring Data Neo4j with other JVM languages, this course will use Java.

2. Familiarity with Spring projects. This course does not cover how Spring works at a general level, but you can learn more about them from Spring's link:https://spring.io/projects[website].

3. Complete the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals] and link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals] courses. You should be familiar with what a graph is and how to use the Cypher query language to read and write data to Neo4j.

.Develop on your local machine
====
You will need link:https://www.java.com[Java] 17 or higher installed.
You can check your version by running `java -version`.
To download Java, you can choose from many link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/requirements/#deployment-requirements-software[supported vendor options^]. For example, link:https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu[Azul's JDK^] or hlink:ttps://openjdk.org/install/[OpenJDK^].

Clone the link:{repository-link}[github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-spring-data] repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-spring-data
----

[TIP]
.Fork the repository
You can link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-spring-data/fork[fork the repository] and have a copy for future reference.

This course uses link:https://maven.apache.org/[Maven^] for dependency management, but the application could migrate to use Gradle instead. Users have valid preferences for either dependency management framework, but for simplicity's sake, we chose to only pick one for this course.

Install the project using Maven:

[source,bash]
----
cd app-spring-data
./mvnw clean install -U -DskipTests
----

Pick an IDE of your choice. If you don't yet have a preference, you can download link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download[IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition^] or link:https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Visual Studio Code^], are both excellent choices.

You do not need to create a Neo4j database as you will use the provided sandbox instance.
