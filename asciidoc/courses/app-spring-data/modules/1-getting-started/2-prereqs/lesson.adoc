= What you will need
:type: lesson

This lesson will walk you through ensuring you have some prior knowledge and skills in certain topics to work with the Spring Data Neo4j library.

== Prerequisites

1. Be able to write Java programs. While you can use Spring Data Neo4j with other JVM languages, this course will use Java.

2. Familiarity with Spring Boot and Spring Data. We will not cover the Boot and Data projects in this course, but you can learn more about them from Spring's link:https://spring.io/projects[website].

3. Be able to build applications with Spring Boot and Spring Data. There are other ways to use Spring with Neo4j (such as with the plain Java Driver, Neo4j Client, Neo4j Template, or OGM components), but using the Spring Boot and Spring Data projects together provides the most consistent and straightforward experience.

4. Have completed the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals] and link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals] courses. You should be familiar with what a graph is and how to use the Cypher query language to create and query a graph database.
