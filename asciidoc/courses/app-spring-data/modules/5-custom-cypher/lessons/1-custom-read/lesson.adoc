= Custom Cypher for Read
:order: 1
:type: lesson

So far, you have used Spring Data's derived find, save, and delete methods against the database. However, there are times when you need something a little different. This is where you can write custom Cypher queries for read operations.

== Defining a custom repository method

Currently you have only implemented the Spring Data's out-of-the-box `findAll()`, `findById()`, `save()`, and `deleteById()` methods.
These methods implement a standard use case for querying and saving data.

When you need something specific, you can define your own methods, and write Cypher statements that query the data and map the results back to a custom method.

For instance, the `findAll()` method works fine to pull the nodes in this movie graph, but what if you had a graph multiple times larger? Even at the current size, it is difficult to view all that data returned on the console. Instead, you could write a custom method to pull a random, smaller subset of the graph each time.

To modify the `findAll()` method you will need to:

. Add a new `Query` method to the `MovieRepository` interface:
** Open the ``MovieRepository.java` interface in `src/main/java/com/example/appspringdata`
** Import the `springframework...Query` class.
+
[source, java]
----
include::code/MovieRepository.java[tag=import]
----
** Add a new `findMoviesSubset()` method that uses the `@Query` annotation to run a Cypher statement.
+
[source, java]
----
include::code/MovieRepository.java[tag=interface]
----
+ 
The interface returns an `Iterable<Movie>`.
. Modify the `MovieController` class to call the new query:
** Open the ``MovieRepository.java` class.
** Update the existing `findAllMovie()` method to call the new query method.
+
[source, java]

include::code/MovieController.java[tag=findAllMovies]

Full code for the `MovieRepository` and `MovieController` classes is available in the dropdown below.

[TIP]
.RETURN aggregation
====
In the `RETURN` statement for the query above, each `Movie` node is returned with its collected `ACTED_IN` relationships and `Person` nodes. This is because the method expects `Movie` nodes, and then aggregates the related entities (relationships and nodes) for each unique movie using Cypher's implicit aggregation for each item listed in the `RETURN` statement.

== Testing the findMoviesSubset() custom method

Once you make the modifications above to your project's interface (new custom query) and controller (call `findMoviesSubset()`), test the new method by running the application and calling the `/movies` endpoint. You should see a response with a subset of movies, each with their `ACTED_IN` relationships and `Person` nodes.

To take this a step further, you can define one more custom method that uses a search parameter. This will be covered in the next lesson.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to write your own custom methods and queries to retrieve data from the database.

Next, you will complete a challenge that builds upon that skill to create custom queries and methods for writing data to the database.
