= Interface-based projections
:order: 5
:type: lesson
:optional: true

Interface-based projections are a great place to start. They are simple to create and commonly used when you want to trim down an entity for user views or retrieval.

Take the `Movie` entity as an example. There are sixteen fields on the entity, which is a lot to work with!

[source,java]
----
include::code/Movie.java[]
----

When you saved a new movie back in Module 4, you only sent a few values, making the return results show a lot of `null` values. What if more of the data contained empty values or you wanted to provide a page for users to scroll through all movies without displaying every field?

You could write a projection to only include a few key fields. Next, you will create a projection that only contains the `title`, `released`, and `poster` properties for each movie.

== MovieProjection interface

To create a projection, create an interface called `MovieProjection.java` in the `src/main/java/com/example/appspringdata` folder. Then call the getter methods of the desired properties for `title`, `released`, and `poster`.

[source,java]
----
include::code/MovieProjection.java[]
----

Now add a new method to each of the `MovieRepository` and `MovieController` files to return a list of `MovieProjection` instead of `Movie` with an endpoint mapping of `/movielist`.

[source,java]
----
include::code/MovieRepository.java[]
include::code/MovieController.java[]
----

Completed repository and controller code is available in the dropdown below.

[TIP]
.Returning a projection from a repository method
====
As mentioned in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/reference/projections/sdn-projections.html#projections.sdn.full-example[documentation^], the return type of the method (`MovieProjection`) is different from the repository's domain type (`Movie`), and therefore must use properties defined in the domain type. The method's suffix `By` is needed to make SDN not look for a property called `MovieProjections` in the `Movie` class.
====

Now, when you test the application and call the `/movies/movielist` endpoint, you will only get the three properties specified in the projection.

[source,shell]
----
curl 'localhost:8080/movies/movielist'
----

.FindMovieProjections sample results

    "title":"The Beatles: Eight Days a Week - The Touring Years",
    "poster":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w440_and_h660_face/A6q7Jy4vXgXXoCoHX4lpCaKvcMV.jpg",
    "released":null
}

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create an interface projection to return a subset of properties from an entity.

In the next optional lesson, you will learn how to create a DTO-based projection for the `Movie` entity.
