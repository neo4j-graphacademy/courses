Your challenge is to create a Person repository interface and controller class to access the person entities in the database.
Then, you will check your work by testing the application and finding a person node.

== PersonRepository

Create an interface called `PersonRepository` that extends the `Neo4jRepository` interface with the appropriate domain and identifier types.

== Test the application

With those pieces in place, you can now test the application. Run the application (either through your IDE or the command line) and execute the following commands in the terminal to see the results.

[source,shell]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/people
curl http://localhost:8080/people/0000245

== Summary

In this lesson, you created repository and controller classes to access `Person` entities in the database. You also ran and tested the application, using an API to call repository methods, query the database, and return the results.

Next, you will map the relationships between `Movie` and `Person` entities.
