= Challenge: Create Person classes
:order: 2
:type: challenge

Your challenge is to use the skills from last lesson to create the class for the Person domain.

== Person node properties

Create a new Java class called `Person` and utilize the following list of properties and data types for the Person node in Neo4j to map in your domain class, using the `imdbId` field as the class's identifier:

[source,text]
----
{
  born:"DATE", 
  bornIn:"STRING", 
  tmdbId:"STRING", 
  bio:"STRING", 
  died:"DATE", 
  name:"STRING", 
  poster:"STRING", 
  imdbId:"STRING", 
  url:"STRING"
}
----

Reference the Cypher-to-Java https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/values-and-types/[data type mappings^] from the documentation, if needed.
