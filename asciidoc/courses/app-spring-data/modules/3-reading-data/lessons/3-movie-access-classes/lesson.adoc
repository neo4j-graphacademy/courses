= Creating Movie repository and controller classes
:order: 3
:type: lesson

You have mapped the `Movie` and `Person` entities in the data domain. Now you need a Movie repository interface and controller class to access the movies in the database.

== Movie repository interface

Start by creating a new file called `MovieRepository.java` in the `src/main/java/com/example/appspringdata` directory, choose `interface` as the type, and extend it to match the following:

[source,java]
----
include::code/MovieRepository.java[tag=movie-repo]
----

Spring Data provides repository extensions for many of its supported projects. They include methods and functionality specifically designed and optimized for the data store. In this case, you extend the `Neo4jRepository` interface. The first type parameter is the domain class that the repository will be working with, and the second type parameter is the type of the identifier for that domain class. In this case, the `Movie` domain class is the entity you want to return and the `String` type is its identifier.

Spring Data also implements a few standard methods, such as `save`, `findById`, `findAll`, and `deleteById`. This is why you don't need to define queries and methods to start out. You will see how to define custom implementations later in this course.

Moving on to the controller class, you will expose the query results with an API.

== Movie controller class

Open the `src/main/java/com/example/appspringdata` directory and create a new class file called `MovieController.java`. Then add code for the following:

1. Add `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping("/movies")` annotations above the class definition.
2. Just inside the class, inject the repository interface with a field called `movieRepo`.
3. Create a constructor and inject the repository.
4. Define two methods to handle `GET` requests:
   * The first method (name it `findAllMovies`) will handle requests to the main (`/movies`) endpoint and return a list of movies, calling the `movieRepo.findAll()` method.
   * The second method (name it `findMovieById`) will handle requests to the `/{movieId}` endpoint and return a single movie, calling the `movieRepo.findById(movieId)` method.

Completed code is available below to check your own work.

You created a standard Spring MVC controller class, annotating it with `@RestController` to handle requests and responses and `@RequestMapping` to handle requests at the `/movies` endpoint. Injecting the repository interface allows access to call any repository methods, with the constructor taking a `MovieRepository` instance as a parameter. This is called dependency injection and is a standard practice in Spring applications.

You defined two methods to handle requests. The first method is annotated with `@GetMapping` and will handle requests to the `/movies` endpoint. It calls one of the out-of-the-box methods that Spring provides, the derived `findAll` method and returns a list of movies. The second method will handle requests to the `/movies/{movieId}` endpoint, including a path variable in the URL for a distinct movie id. It calls the derived `findById` method on the repository (passing in the path variable value) and returns the results.

== Summary

In this lesson, you created a repository interface and controller class to access `Movie` entities.

Next, you will run the application and test it out.
