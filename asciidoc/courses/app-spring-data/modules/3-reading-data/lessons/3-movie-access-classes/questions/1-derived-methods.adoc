= 1. Spring derived methods

What is the reason you did not define queries and methods in the `MovieRepository` interface?

- [ ] You don't need to access the database.
- [ ] You can't define queries and methods in the repository interface.
- [*] Spring provides a few derived methods out-of-the-box (`findAll`, `findById`, `save`, `deleteById`).


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Methods such as `findAll`, `findById`, `save`, and `deleteById` are often standard across implementations, so Spring Data provides them out-of-the-box, avoiding boilerplate redundancy. _Side note: Custom implementations can also be defined when needed._

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The answer is that Spring provides a few derived methods out-of-the-box (such as `findAll`, `findById`, etc). This is why you don't need to define queries and methods to start out because Spring Data implements them by default.
