= Creating Movie classes
:order: 1
:type: lesson

The movie data model shows entities for movies, people, and the relationships between them. You will start your application domain with the Movie entity.

== Movie domain class

A Java domain class will represent the Movie entity. While you wouldn't need to map all of the fields on the `Movie` node, you will go ahead and map all of them for this example.

Open the `Movie.java` class in the `src/main/java/com/example/appspringdata` directory.

include::code/Movie.java[tag=**]

Review the code and note the following:

. The `Movie` class definition:
+ 
[source,java]
----
include::code/Movie.java[tag=class]
----
+
The `@Node` annotation above the class definition marks the class as a node entity.
. That `Movie` node properties are mapped to `Movie` class attributes with a relevant data type:

{
  budget:"INTEGER", 
  movieId:"STRING", 
  tmdbId:"STRING", 
  imdbVotes:"INTEGER", 
  runtime:"INTEGER", 
  countries:"LIST OF STRING", 
  imdbId:"STRING", 
  url:"STRING", 
  plot:"STRING", 
  released:"STRING", 
  languages:"LIST OF STRING", 
  imdbRating:"FLOAT", 
  title:"STRING", 
  poster:"STRING", 
  year:"INTEGER", 
  revenue:"INTEGER"
}

[source,java]
.Movie class attributes
----
include::code/Movie.java[tag=properties]

The `@Id` annotation on the `movieId` field marks it as the node identifier.
+
. The class constructor:
+
[source,java]
----
include::code/Movie.java[tag=constructor]
----
. Getter and setters for each property:
[source,java]
----
include::code/Movie.java[tag=getter]

[TIP]
The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/values-and-types/[Neo4j Values and types documentation] (Table 1) shows theNeo4j data types and equivalent Java type.

[TIP]
.MovieId
====
For simplicity, you are using the existing `movieId` key value and only the `@Id` annotation.
The preferred method is to use a UUIDGenerator or optimistic locking with external id values.
====

[TIP]
.Related entity in constructor
====
You can include the related entity in the constructor because there isn't a bidirectional relationship defined (Movie<-Person, Person->Movie) and the data model is not cyclic (you cannot iterate over same movie and person multiple times). 

Advice on how to manage bidirectional relationships is covered later in this module.

== Summary

In this lesson, you created the Movie domain class.

Next, you will complete a challenge to apply the skills you learned here to create the Person domain class.
