= Relationship Properties
:order: 7
:type: lesson

Last lesson, you mapped the `ACTED_IN` relationship from the graph to the `actors` field in the `Movie` class. Now you will map the relationship's property `role` by creating a separate `Role` class to contain the field.

== Add relationship properties class

In your application, create a new Java class called `Role` in the `src/main/java/com/example/appspringdata` package. This class will represent the relationship properties stored on the relationship between a `Person` and a `Movie` node.

Add the following code to the `Role` class:

[source,java]
----
include::code/Role.java[tag=role-property]
----

[TIP]
.Role setter methods
====
You do not need setter methods for the `id` and `person` fields because the id is handled by the database, and the Person entity is handled by a separate class.
====

Completed code is available below to check your work.

== Test the application (again!)

Start the application and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/movies/2` from a browser window. You should see the same list of movie properties as before, plus one for `role` containing the name(s) of the character(s) the person played in that movie.

//TODO: screenshot of output here!

Nice work! You mapped the `ACTED_IN` relationship from the graph to the `actors` field in the `Movie` class, and you mapped a relationship property for `role` by creating a separate `Role` class to contain the field.

== Summary

In this lesson, you mapped the relationship property for the roles actors played in movies by creating a separate `Role` class.

Next, you can optionally learn about some application modeling mistakes to avoid when working with Neo4j. Or you can continue onto the next module to learn how to write data to the database from the application.
