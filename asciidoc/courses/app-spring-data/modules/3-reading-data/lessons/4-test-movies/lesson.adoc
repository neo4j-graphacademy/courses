= Testing Movie classes
:order: 4
:type: lesson

In the last lesson, you created the access classes (repository and controller) for the `Movie` entity. Now you will test the application to see the results.

== Running and testing the application

Run your application. Once the application is running, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/movies` to see the results of the `findAll` method.

.Testing from local environment setup
====
To run the application, start it from your preferred IDE or use the following command in a terminal window:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
====

.FindAll Results (example)
----
{
  "movieId":"1",
  "title":"Toy Story",
  "plot":"A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new spaceman figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's room.",
  "poster":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w440_and_h660_face/uXDfjJbdP4ijW5hWSBrPrlKpxab.jpg",

[TIP]
.Random results order
====
Results may not be in the same order or formatted exactly as shown above. Formatted results depend on whether pretty-printing is enabled in your browser or command line styling.
====

To test the `findById` method, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/movies/2` and review the results.

.FindById Results (example)
----
{
  "movieId": "2",
  "title": "Jumanji",
  "plot": "When two kids find and play a magical board game, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game.",
