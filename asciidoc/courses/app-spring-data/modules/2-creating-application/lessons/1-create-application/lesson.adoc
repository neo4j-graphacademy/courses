= Create a Spring application

:type: lesson

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications to integrate with data access technologies.

The Spring Data Neo4j (SDN) library aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for integrating with the https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] graph database.

== Importing the Library

There are several ways to go about creating a Spring Data Neo4j project. We will use Spring Boot, which we recommend for the automatic configuration and (especially) the dependency management.

=== Spring Initializr

The simplest method to create a Spring Boot project is to use the https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr]. It is a web-based form and API that allows you to select the starting components (such as language and dependencies) you want to include in your project, helping you to create projects quickly.

Generating the project with the Spring Initializr will give you a zip file containing a Maven or Gradle project, depending on your selection. You will need to unzip it to get a standard project folder.

If you don't want to use the web-based UI of the Spring Initializr, you can also use the Spring Initializr API to create the project from the command line.

=== Maven configuration

[source,shell]
----
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d dependencies=web,data-neo4j  \
  -d type=maven-project \
  -d bootVersion=3.1.2 \
  -d baseDir=app-spring-data \             
  -d name=app-spring-data | tar -xzvf -
----

=== Gradle configuration

[source,shell]
----
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d dependencies=web,data-neo4j  \
  -d bootVersion=3.1.2 \
  -d baseDir=app-spring-data \             
  -d name=app-spring-data | tar -xzvf -
----

=== Opening the project

Any of the methods above will create a new folder called `app-spring-data`. Inside, you will find either the Maven or Gradle project. You can open it in your favorite IDE.
