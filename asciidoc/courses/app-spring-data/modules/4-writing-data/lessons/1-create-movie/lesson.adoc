= Creating Movie nodes
:order: 1
:type: lesson
:sandbox: true

You have learned in previous lessons how to read nodes and relationships from the database. Now you will learn how to write them to the database by using the `save()` method to create a new node in Neo4j.

== Save() method

If you remember from an earlier lesson, Spring Data has some derived methods that are provided out-of-the-box. One of those is the `save()` method for saving data to a database. You will use this method to create new nodes in Neo4j.

Most of the pieces for adding this functionality are already in place, so you will just need to add the method in the `MovieController` class. Open the `MovieController.java` file in the `src/main/java/com/example/appspringdata` directory and add the following code:

[source,java]
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/movies")
public class MovieController {
    //previous code and methods

    @PostMapping("/save")
    Movie save(@RequestBody Movie movie) {
        return movieRepo.save(movie);
    }
}
----

Full code for the `MovieController` class is available in the dropdown below.

[source,java]
----
include::code/MovieController.java[tag=save-method]
----
====

This method is annotated with `@PostMapping` and will handle requests to the `/movies/save` endpoint. It calls the `save()` method on the repository and returns the results.

== Testing the save() method

You will need to pass values for the new movie object you want to create. While the `Movie` domain class contains several fields, most are not required, so you can pick and choose what to send. For this example, you will send the `movieId` and `title` fields, which are outlined in a sample `movie.json` file (`src/main/resources` folder). The contents of the `movie.json` file are shown below.

[source,json]
----
include::code/movie.json[]
----

Test the `save()` method on the command line by running the application and running the following command in the terminal tab:

//TODO: Figure out how this works in Gitpod!

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST localhost:8080/movies/save \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
  -d @src/main/resources/movie.json
----

You should see something like the following output:

[source,shell]
----
{"movieId":"9876","title":"MyMovie","plot":null,"poster":null,"url":null,"imdbId":null,"tmdbId":null,"released":null,"year":null,"runtime":null,"budget":null,"revenue":null,"imdbVotes":null,"imdbRating":null,"languages":null,"countries":null,"actors":null}
----

You can also execute the provided query in the right-hand tab to see the new node in the database.

Feel free to play around with including different fields and values in the `movie.json` file.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create a `Movie` node in Neo4j using the `save()` method.

In the next lesson, you will build upon that skill to create a pattern (node with relationships).
