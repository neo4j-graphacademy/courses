= Creating Movie Actors
:order: 2
:type: lesson
:sandbox: true

You now know how to add a `Movie` node to the database. But what if you also want to add the actors who acted in the movie? You can do this by passing a little more data to the `save()` method.

== Testing the save() method with relationships

You can include information for saving relationships to the JSON file and pass it to the `save()` method without any additional code changes.

Because the `actors` field is already part of the `Movie` domain class, the extra data will automatically get mapped. The `actors` field is a `List<Role>` which traverses to the `Role` class then to the `Person` class via the relationship, so the JSON file needs to contain an array of `Person` objects. The `save()` method will then map those to the `actors` field.

Just like in the last lesson to add a new movie, the `movieRels.json` file below (`src/main/resources` folder) shows the added data.

[source,json]
----
include::code/movieRels.json[]
----

Now run the application, then execute the statement below in the terminal to test.

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST 'localhost:8080/movies/save' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
  -d @src/main/resources/movieRels.json
----

Output from the command should look something like this:

[source,shell]
----
{"movieId":"9876","title":"MyMovie","plot":null,"poster":null,"url":null,"imdbId":null,"tmdbId":null,"released":null,"year":null,"runtime":null,"budget":null,"revenue":null,"imdbVotes":null,"imdbRating":null,"languages":null,"countries":null,"actors":[{"id":null,"role":"self","person":{"imdbId":"12","tmdbId":null,"name":"Jennifer Reif","bio":null,"poster":null,"url":null,"bornIn":null,"born":null,"died":null}}]}
----

And check the results in the database by running the query populated in the right-hand tab.

Just as before, feel free to play around with the data in the JSON file and save different variations of the movie and actors.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to save nodes with their relationships to the database.

Next, you will learn how to delete nodes in the database.
