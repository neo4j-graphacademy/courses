== Course Description

In this course, you will learn how to integrate Neo4j into your LangChain applications, enabling you to leverage the power of graph databases in your Generative AI workflows.

You will learn how to: 

. Use the `langchain_neo4j` package to interact with Neo4j through a LangChain application.
. Create RAG and GraphRAG retrievers.
. Implement and tune a text-to-Cypher retriever.
. Create a simple LangChain agent that interacts with Neo4j. 

This course uses models from link:https://openai.com/[OpenAI^], although you can use the model and supplier of your choice.

=== Prerequisites

Before taking this course, you should have:

* A basic understanding of Graph Databases and Neo4j
* Knowledge of Python and basic familiarity with LangChain

We recommend taking the following courses: 

* link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^].
* link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j & GenAI Fundamentals^].

If you are new to LangChain, we recommend completing the LangChain link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/llm_chain/[Build a simple LLM application^] and link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/chatbot/[Build a Chatbot^] tutorials.

To complete the practical tasks within this course, you will need an link:https://platform.openai.com[OpenAI API key^].
