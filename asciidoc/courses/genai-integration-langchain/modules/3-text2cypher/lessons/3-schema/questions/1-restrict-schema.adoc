= Why Restrict the Schema?

Why might you want to restrict the schema when generating Cypher queries with an LLM? (Select all that apply)

* [x] To reduce the complexity of the generated Cypher queries
* [ ] To improve query performance
* [x] To help the LLM focus on the relevant parts of the graph
* [x] To exclude irrelevant or unwanted parts of the graph that may confuse the LLM

====
How would limiting the available node labels and relationship types might affect the LLM's ability to generate accurate and relevant Cypher queries?

.Solution
====
The correct answers are:

* [x] To reduce the complexity of the generated Cypher queries
* [x] To help the LLM focus on the relevant parts of the graph
* [x] To exclude irrelevant or unwanted parts of the graph that may confuse the LLM

While restricting the schema may indirectly impact query performance, this is not guaranteed.
