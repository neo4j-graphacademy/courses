= Why Use Different LLMs?

Why might you choose to use different LLMs for generating the Cypher query and generating the answer in the Cypher QA chain?

* [ ] To reduce the number of requests sent to the LLMs
* [x] Because generating Cypher queries and generating answers may have different requirements
* [ ] To make the generation run faster
* [ ] Because only some LLMs can connect to Neo4j

Think about the differences between writing a database query and writing a natural language answer. 
What kinds of skills or capabilities might be needed for each task?

.Solution
====
The answer is *Because generating Cypher queries and generating answers may require different strengths or capabilities from the LLM*.

Generating a Cypher query and generating a natural language answer are two different tasks that may require different strengths from an LLM. Some models may be better at producing precise, structured queries, while others may excel at generating clear, conversational answers. 

Using different LLMs allows you to choose the best model for each part of the process, improving the overall quality of the results.
