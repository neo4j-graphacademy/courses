= Text to Cypher
:order: 1

== Module Overview

Vector retrievers are great for finding relevant data based on semantic similarity.

To answer more specific questions, you may need to perform more complex queries to find data relating to specific nodes, relationships, or properties.

Text to Cypher allows you to convert natural language queries into Cypher queries that can be executed against the graph.

In this module, you will:

* Use the Cypher QA (question-answering) chain to query the graph using natural language queries.
* Create a custom Cypher generation prompt include specific instructions and examples queries.
* Explore how restricting the schema can support more focused queries.
* Add a text to Cypher retriever to a LangChain agent.
