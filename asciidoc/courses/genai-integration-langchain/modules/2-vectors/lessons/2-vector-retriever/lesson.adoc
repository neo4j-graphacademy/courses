Vector search can be used in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications to find relevant documents based on their content.

In this lesson, you will update the LangChain agent to use a vector retriever that will allow you to search for movies based on plot. 

Open the `genai-integration-langchain/vector_retriever.py` file.

.vector_retriever.py
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/vector_retriever.py[tags=**]
----

The code is similar to the agent you explored in the previous module.

To add the vector RAG retriever, you will to: 

. Connect to Neo4j using `Neo4jGraph`
. Create an embedding model
. Create a vector store using `Neo4jVector`
. Update the `retrieve` function to use the vector store

== Neo4j connection

Connect to Neo4j using `Neo4jGraph`:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=import_neo4j]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=graph]
----

== Embedding model

Create the embedding model using `OpenAIEmbeddings`:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=import_embedding_model]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=embedding_model]
----

== Vector store

Create the vector store using `Neo4jVector`:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=import_neo4jvector]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=plot_vector]
----

== Retriever

Finally, you need to update the `retrieve` function to use the vector store.

The `retrieve` function will need to:

. Use the `similarity_search` method of the `Neo4jVector` class to find similar nodes based on the `question`.
. Store the results as the `context` for the agent.

====

Run the application, review the results, and experiment with different questions:

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=examples]

== Context

The `context` is a list of `Document` objects returned by the `similarity_search` method. The `Document` `content` contains the movie plot and the node's properties are returned as `metadata`.

[NOTE]
====
The `context` is defined in the `State` class:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=state]
----

You can define the `context` as any data type you want, as long as the `retrieve` function returns it in the expected format.
====

It is useful in development to output the `context` to see what data was used to generate the answer.

Update the code to print the `context` after the answer is generated:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=print_context]
----

Try running the application again and see how the `context` relates to the question and generated answer.

When you are ready, continue to the next module.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to integrate a Neo4j vector store with a LangChain agent.

In the next lesson, you will extend the retriever to use data from a graph.
