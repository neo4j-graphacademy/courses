* [ ] To connect to the Neo4j database
* [x] To convert text into a vector representation
* [ ] To create the vector index in the database

.Solution

The answer is *To convert text into a vector representation*.

The `Neo4jVector` class requires an embedding model to convert the input text (such as a search query) into a vector. 
The query vector can then be compared to the vectors stored in the database to find similar items.
