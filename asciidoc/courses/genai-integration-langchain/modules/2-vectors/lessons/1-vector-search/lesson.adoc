= Vector Search

In this lesson, you will learn how to use vectors indexes with LangChain to perform vector search.

== Movie Plots

Each `Movie` node in the database has a `.plot` property.

.Movie Plot Example
[source,cypher]
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Toy Story"})
RETURN m.title AS title, m.plot AS plot

    "A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new spaceman figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's room."

Embeddings have been created for 1000 movie plots. 
The embedding is stored in the `.plotEmbedding` property of the `Movie` nodes.

.View the plot embedding
[source,cypher]
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Toy Story"})
RETURN m.title AS title, m.plot AS plot, m.plotEmbedding

A vector index, `moviePlots`, has been created for the `.plotEmbedding` property of the `Movie` nodes.

You can use the `moviePlots` vector index to find the most similar movies by comparing embeddings of movie plots.

[TIP]
You can learn more about creating embeddings and vector indexes in the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-vectors-unstructured[GraphAcademy Introduction to Vector Indexes and Unstructured Data course^].

== Similarity Search

The link:https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/neo4j/vectorstores/langchain_neo4j.vectorstores.neo4j_vector.Neo4jVector.html[`Neo4jVector`^] class provides an interface to use vector indexes in Neo4j.
You can use `Neo4jVector` to create a vector store that can modify data and perform similarity search.

Open the `genai-integration-langchain/vector_search.py` file.

.vector_search.py
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/vector_search.py[tag=**]
----

To perform a similarity search, you need to:

. Connect to a Neo4j database
. Create an embedding model to convert a query into a vector
. Create a `Neo4jVector` instance and connect to the database
. Use the `similarity_search` method to find similar nodes based on the query

== Embedding model

The movie plot embeddings were created using the OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` model.
You need to use the same model to convert the query into vectors.

Use the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class to create the embedding model:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_search.py[tag=import_embedding_model]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_search.py[tag=embedding_model]
----

== Vector Store

Use the `Neo4jVector` class to create a vector store that connects to the Neo4j database, uses the embedding model, and the `moviePlots` index.

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_search.py[tag=import_neo4jvector]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_search.py[tag=plot_vector]
----

When specifying the vector index you must also state the properties that contain the text (`text_node_property`) and the embedding (`embedding_node_property`).

== Search

The `similarity_search` method of the `Neo4jVector` class allows you to perform a similarity search based on a query.

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_search.py[tag=search]
----

The query is converted into a vector using the embedding model, and then the vector index is used to find the most similar nodes.

The `k` parameter specifies the number of similar nodes to return.

----
====

Running the code will return the most similar movies to the query.

The method returns a list of LangChain link:https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html[`Document`^] objects, each containing the plot as the `content` and the node properties as `metadata`.

You can parse the results to extract the movie titles and plots.

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_search.py[tag=results]
----

Experiment with different plots, such as:

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/vector_search.py[tag=examples]

[TIP]
.Filtering results
====
You can filter the results of the `similarity_search` method by using the `filter` parameter.

The `filter` parameter allows you to specify a condition to filter the results, for example, only return movies with a `revenue` gretaer than 200 million:

[source,python]
----
result = plot_vector.similarity_search(
    plot, 
    k=3,
    filter={"revenue": {"$gte": 200000000}}
)
----

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to use the `Neo4jVector` class to perform vector search.

In the next lesson, you will add a RAG vector retriever to the agent to retrieve relevant movie plots based on user queries.
