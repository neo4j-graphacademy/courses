:type: lesson


You can enhance a vector retriever by using the graph structure to provide additional context to the retrieved nodes. 

In this lesson, you will update the vector retriever to include additional data and create a GraphRAG retriever.

You can add an additional Cypher retrieval query to the `Neo4jVector` class. The retrieval query is run after the similarity search and the data it returns is added to the `Document` metadata.
