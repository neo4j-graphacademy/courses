You can query Neo4j from a LangChain application using the link:https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/neo4j/graphs/langchain_neo4j.graphs.neo4j_graph.Neo4jGraph.html[`Neo4jGraph`^] class.
The `Neo4jGraph` class acts as the connection to the database when using other LangChain components, such as retrievers and agents.

In this lesson, you will modify the simple LangChain agent to be able to answer questions about a graph database schema.

The database contains information about movies, actors, and user ratings.

== Query Neo4j

To query Neo4j you need to: 

. Create a `Neo4jGraph` instance and connect to a database
. Run a Cypher statement to get data from the database

Open the `genai-integration-langchain/neo4j_query.py` file:

.neo4j_query.py
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/neo4j_query.py[tag=**]
----

Update the code to:

. Connect to the Neo4j database using your connection details:
+
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/neo4j_query.py[tag=import_neo4j]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/neo4j_query.py[tag=neo4jgraph]
----
. Run a Cypher query to retrieve data from the database:
+
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/neo4j_query.py[tag=query]
----

The results are returned as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the results.

    [
        {'actor': 'Henry Czerny', 'role': 'Eugene Kittridge'}, 
        {'actor': 'Emmanuelle BÃ©art', 'role': 'Claire Phelps'}, 
        {'actor': 'Tom Cruise', 'role': 'Ethan Hunt'}, 
        {'actor': 'Jon Voight', 'role': 'Jim Phelps'}
    ]

You can use data returned from queries as context for an agent. 

== Schema

You are going to modify the agent to retrieve the database schema and add it to the `context`.

You can view the database schema using the Cypher query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization()
----

Open the `genai-integration-langchain/scheme_agent.py` file.

.schema_agent.py
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/schema_agent.py[tag=**]
----

Add the code to create a connection to the Neo4j database using the `Neo4jGraph` class:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/schema_agent.py[tag=import_neo4jgraph]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/schema_agent.py[tag=neo4jgraph]
----

Modify the `retrieve` function to use the `Neo4jGraph` instance to query the database and retrieve the schema information:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/schema_agent.py[tag=retrieve]
----

The agent will add the database schema to the `context` and use it to answer questions about the database.

Update the question and run the application:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/schema_agent.py[tag=question]
----

When asked "How is the graph structured?", the agent will response with a summary of the graph, typically including details about nodes, relationships, and their properties.

The graph is structured using nodes and relationships. 

* Nodes:
** **Movie**: Has indexes on `year`, `imdbRating`, `released`, `imdbId`, `title`, and `tagline`. It has unique constraints on `movieId` and `tmdbId`.
** **User**: Has an index on `name` and a unique constraint on `userId`.
** **Actor**, **Director**, and **Genre**: Do not have indexes listed. The **Genre** node has a unique constraint on `name`.
** **Person**: Has an index on `name` and a unique constraint on `tmdbId`.

* Relationships:
** **ACTED_IN**: Connects `Actor`, `Director`, or `Person` nodes with `Movie` nodes.
** **RATED**: Connects `User` nodes to `Movie` nodes.
** **IN_GENRE**: Connects `Movie` nodes to `Genre` nodes.
** **DIRECTED**: Connects `Person`, `Actor`, or `Director` nodes to `Movie` nodes.

In summary, the graph represents a network where movies are connected to various entities like users, genres, actors, directors, and general persons through specific relationships indicating roles like acting, directing, rating, and categorization into genres.

Experiment by asking the agent other questions about the database schema. Here are some examples:

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to query Neo4j from LangChain and updated the agent to retrieve the database schema.

In the next module, you learn how to use vectors to create RAG and GraphRAG retrievers.
