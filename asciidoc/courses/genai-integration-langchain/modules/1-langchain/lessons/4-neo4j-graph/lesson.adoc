You can query Neo4j from a LangChain application using the link:https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/neo4j/graphs/langchain_neo4j.graphs.neo4j_graph.Neo4jGraph.html[`Neo4jGraph`^] class.
The `Neo4jGraph` class acts as the connection to the database when using other LangChain components, such as retrievers and agents.

In this lesson, you will modify the simple LangChain agent to be able to answer questions about a graph database schema.

== Query Neo4j

To query Neo4j you will need to: 

. Create a `Neo4jGraph` instance and connect to a database
. Run a Cypher statement to get data from the database

The database contains information about movies, actors, and user ratings.

Open the `genai-integration-langchain/neo4j_query.py` file:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/neo4j_query.py[tag=**]
----

Update the code to:

. Connect to the Neo4j database using your connection details:
+
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/neo4j_query.py[tag=import_neo4j]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/neo4j_query.py[tag=neo4jgraph]
----
. Run a Cypher query to retrieve data from the database:
+
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/neo4j_query.py[tag=query]
----

The results are returned as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the results.

    [
        {'actor': 'Henry Czerny', 'role': 'Eugene Kittridge'}, 
        {'actor': 'Emmanuelle BÃ©art', 'role': 'Claire Phelps'}, 
        {'actor': 'Tom Cruise', 'role': 'Ethan Hunt'}, 
        {'actor': 'Jon Voight', 'role': 'Jim Phelps'}
    ]

== Schema

You can use data returned from queries as context for the agent you review in the last lesson.

You can view the database schema using the Cypher query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization()
----

If you include this information in the agent's `context`, the agent will be able to answer questions about the database schema.

Open the `genai-integration-langchain/simple_agent.py` file.

Add the code to create a connection to the Neo4j database using the `Neo4jGraph` class:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/schema_agent.py[tag=import_neo4jgraph]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/schema_agent.py[tag=neo4jgraph]
----

Modify the `retrieve` function to use the `Neo4jGraph` instance to query the database and retrieve the schema information:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/schema_agent.py[tag=retrieve]
----

Update the question to ask about the database schema:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-integration-langchain/solutions/schema_agent.py[tag=question]
----

The agent will add the database schema to the `context` and use it to answer questions about the database.

When asked "How is the graph structured?", the agent will response with a summary of the graph, usually including details about nodes, relationships, and their properties.

====
The graph is structured using nodes and relationships. 

Nodes:

* **Movie**: Has indexes on `year`, `imdbRating`, `released`, `imdbId`, `title`, and `tagline`. It has unique constraints on `movieId` and `tmdbId`.
* **User**: Has an index on `name` and a unique constraint on `userId`.
* **Actor**, **Director**, and **Genre**: Do not have indexes listed. The **Genre** node has a unique constraint on `name`.
* **Person**: Has an index on `name` and a unique constraint on `tmdbId`.

Relationships:

* **ACTED_IN**: Connects `Actor`, `Director`, or `Person` nodes with `Movie` nodes.
* **RATED**: Connects `User` nodes to `Movie` nodes.
* **IN_GENRE**: Connects `Movie` nodes to `Genre` nodes.
* **DIRECTED**: Connects `Person`, `Actor`, or `Director` nodes to `Movie` nodes.

In summary, the graph represents a network where movies are connected to various entities like users, genres, actors, directors, and general persons through specific relationships indicating roles like acting, directing, rating, and categorization into genres.

Experiment by asking the agent other questions about the database schema, here are some examples:

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to query Neo4j from LangChain and updated the agent to retrieve the database schema.

In the next module, you learn how to use vectors to create RAG and GraphRAG retrievers.
