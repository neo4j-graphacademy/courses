:order: 1
:type: lesson

LangChain is a popular framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). 

Integrating Neo4j with LangChain allows developers to build advanced AI applications that can reason over graph data, generate Cypher queries, and provide context-aware answers.

Neo4j supports LangChain with dedicated modules and tools for working with graph databases, making it easier to build applications that leverage both LLMs and graph data.

== Capabilities

LangChain & Neo4j integration supports:

- **Contextual Retrieval** - Retrieve relevant subgraphs or nodes from Neo4j to provide context for LLM-powered answers.
- **Querying Graph Data with Natural Language** - Use LLMs to translate user questions into Cypher queries, enabling natural language access to graph data.
- **Automated Reasoning** - Combine the reasoning abilities of LLMs with the structured relationships in Neo4j for more accurate and insightful responses.
- **Conversational AI** - Build chatbots and assistants that can answer questions about complex, connected data stored in Neo4j.
- **Knowledge Graph Construction** - Automatically construct knowledge graphs from unstructured data using LLMs, and store them in Neo4j for further analysis.

During this course you will explore how to get started with Neo4j and LangChain, including setting up your environment, building agents, and using graph data to enhance LLM capabilities.
