= Server Features Overview
:type: lesson
:order: 3


Now that your server is connected to Neo4j, you can build database-backed features.

In this lesson, you'll review the three main MCP server features and understand when to use each one.


== The Three Core Features

MCP servers expose three types of features to clients:


=== Tools

**Tools** are functions that LLMs can call to perform actions or retrieve data.


**Characteristics:**

* Called by the LLM (model-controlled)
* Can have side effects (create, update, delete)
* Can perform computation
* Return structured results


**Use tools when:**

* You need to execute code or query a database
* The action depends on user input or context
* You want the LLM to decide when to use it


**Example:** A tool to search movies by genre, create a recommendation, or update user preferences.


=== Resources

**Resources** expose data that can be loaded into the LLM's context.


**Characteristics:**

* Accessed by the client application (application-controlled)
* Read-only (no side effects)
* Typically static or parameterized URIs
* Provide context for the LLM


**Use resources when:**

* You want to expose data that doesn't change often
* The client decides what to load (not the LLM)
* You're providing reference information or documentation


**Example:** A resource that returns details about a specific movie by ID, or API documentation.


=== Prompts

**Prompts** are pre-defined templates that help users interact with your server.


**Characteristics:**

* Invoked by the user (user-controlled)
* Provide reusable templates
* Can accept parameters
* Guide the conversation


**Use prompts when:**

* You want to provide common workflows
* Users need help formulating requests
* You want to standardize interactions


**Example:** A prompt template for "recommend movies similar to X" or "analyze my viewing history".

| Feature | Control | Purpose | Example

| **Tools**
| LLM decides
| Execute actions, query data
| Search movies by genre

| **Resources**
| Client/App decides
| Provide context and reference data
| Get movie details by ID

| **Prompts**
| User decides
| Template common workflows
| Movie recommendation workflow

== In This Module

In the following lessons, you'll build each type of feature:

1. **Tools with Context** - Query Neo4j and provide logging
2. **Resources** - Expose movie data via URI patterns
3. **Pagination** - Handle large result sets efficiently
4. **Prompts** - Create reusable templates

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the three core MCP features:

* **Tools** - Functions called by the LLM to perform actions (model-controlled)
* **Resources** - Data exposed via URIs for context (application-controlled)
* **Prompts** - Templates for common workflows (user-controlled)

Understanding when to use each feature will help you design effective MCP servers.

In the next lesson, you'll learn about the Context object and how to use it in your tools.
