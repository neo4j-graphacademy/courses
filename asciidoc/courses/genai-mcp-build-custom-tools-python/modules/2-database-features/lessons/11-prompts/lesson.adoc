= Building Prompts
:type: lesson
:order: 11


You've built tools that LLMs can call and resources that clients can load. Now you'll learn about **prompts** - reusable templates that guide users in how to interact with your MCP server. Unlike tools and resources, prompts are **user-controlled** - users explicitly choose when to use them through a UI menu or slash command.


== Creating Prompts with FastMCP

FastMCP provides the `@mcp.prompt()` decorator to create prompts:

[source,python]
----
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Movies GraphRAG Server")


@mcp.prompt()
def movie_recommendation() -> str:
    """Get movie recommendations based on your preferences."""
    return """I'd like to discover new movies to watch.

Please ask me about:
1. What genres I enjoy
2. Any specific movies I've loved
3. My preferred movie era or style

Then recommend 5 movies I might enjoy and explain why each one would be a good fit."""
----



== Prompts with Parameters

Prompts can accept parameters to customize the template:

[source,python]
----
@mcp.prompt()
def similar_movies(movie_title: str, count: int = 5) -> str:
    """Find movies similar to one you enjoyed."""
    return f"""I really enjoyed the movie "{movie_title}".

Can you recommend {count} similar movies and explain why each one is similar?

Consider factors like:
- Genre and themes
- Director or actors
- Mood and tone
- Era and style"""
----

Users provide the parameters when invoking the prompt, and the template is filled in.


== Multi-Message Prompts

Prompts can return multiple messages to create a conversation flow:

[source,python]
----
from mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts import base

@mcp.prompt()
def analyze_preferences(favorite_movies: str) -> list[base.Message]:
    """Analyze your movie preferences and recommend genres."""
    
    return [
        base.UserMessage(
            content=f"Here are my favorite movies: {favorite_movies}"
        ),
        base.AssistantMessage(
            content="I'll analyze your movie preferences. Let me look at the genres and themes..."
        ),
        base.UserMessage(
            content="Based on my favorites, what genres should I explore next?"
        )
    ]
----

This creates a conversation starter that includes both user and assistant messages.


== Prompt Best Practices

**1. Be specific and actionable:**

[source,python]
----
# Good - specific guidance
@mcp.prompt()
def movie_night_planner() -> str:
    """Plan a themed movie night."""
    return """Help me plan a movie night with these details:
    
1. Theme or genre I want to explore
2. Number of movies (2-4 recommended)
3. Any constraints (runtime, rating, era)

Create a curated list with:
- Movie titles and years
- Why they fit the theme
- Suggested watching order
- Total runtime"""

# Avoid - too vague
@mcp.prompt()
def movies() -> str:
    """Movies."""
    return "Tell me about movies"
----


**2. Provide structure:**

[source,python]
----
@mcp.prompt()
def movie_review_template(movie_title: str) -> str:
    """Write a structured movie review."""
    return f"""Write a review of "{movie_title}" covering:

**Plot Summary** (no spoilers)
- Brief overview in 2-3 sentences

**Strengths**
- What worked well?
- Standout performances?

**Weaknesses**  
- What could be improved?

**Overall Verdict**
- Rating out of 10
- Who would enjoy this movie?"""
----


**3. Use clear parameters:**

[source,python]
----
@mcp.prompt()
def discovery_prompt(
    genre: str,
    decade: str = "any",
    mood: str = "any"
) -> str:
    """Discover hidden gems in a specific genre."""
    
    filters = []
    if decade != "any":
        filters.append(f"from the {decade}s")
    if mood != "any":
        filters.append(f"with a {mood} mood")
    
    filter_text = " ".join(filters) if filters else "from any era"
    
    return f"""Help me discover lesser-known {genre} movies {filter_text}.

Find me 5 hidden gems that:
- Have high ratings but are under-appreciated
- Represent the genre well
- Offer something unique

For each movie, explain:
- Why it's worth watching
- What makes it special
- Who would enjoy it"""
----


== When to Use Prompts

Prompts are ideal for common workflows and complex requests. In our movie server, they help with tasks like:

* **Movie recommendations** - "Find movies based on my favorites"
* **Themed planning** - "Plan a movie marathon with specific criteria"
* **Guided discovery** - "Help me explore new genres with structured questions"
* **Analysis templates** - "Compare two movies using standard criteria"


== Prompts vs Tools

While tools are functions that execute code when the LLM needs them, prompts are pre-written templates that users explicitly select. They work together - a prompt might guide the user to ask questions that lead the LLM to call specific tools. For example, a movie recommendation prompt could guide the conversation that leads to calling the `search_movies_by_genre()` tool.


== Adding Prompts to Your Server

Prompts are simple to add - just use the decorator:

[source,python]
----
@mcp.prompt()
def movie_discovery(genre: str = "any") -> str:
    """Discover new movies in a genre."""
    
    if genre == "any":
        return """Help me discover new movies! What genres do I enjoy?
What recent movies have I loved? Do I prefer classics or new releases?"""
    
    return f"""Recommend 5 diverse {genre} movies that span different
styles and eras. Explain why each is a great example of the genre."""

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about MCP prompts:

* **User-controlled templates** - Users explicitly invoke prompts
* **`@mcp.prompt()` decorator** - Create prompts with optional parameters
* **Multi-message prompts** - Build conversation flows
* **Best practices** - Be specific, provide structure, use clear parameters
* **Use cases** - Common workflows, guided interactions, templates
* **Prompts vs Tools** - Templates vs executable functions

Prompts make your server more user-friendly by providing pre-written templates for common tasks.
