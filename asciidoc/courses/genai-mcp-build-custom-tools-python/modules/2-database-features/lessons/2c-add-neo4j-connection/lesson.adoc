= Add Neo4j Connection
:type: challenge
:order: 2


In the previous lesson, you learned about lifespan management and how it helps you properly manage resources like database connections.

In this challenge, you will build a _Movies GraphRAG Server_ that uses lifespan management to establish and maintain a connection to a Neo4j database.


== Challenge Goals

To complete this challenge, you will:

1. Install required Python packages
2. Configure environment variables for Neo4j connection details
3. Create a lifespan function that initializes a Neo4j driver on startup
4. Update your server to use the lifespan function
5. Verify the connection works


[TIP]
.Solution Available
====
If you get stuck, you can review the complete solution in the repository at `solutions/2c-add-neo4j-connection/main.py`.

To see the solution in action, run:

[source,bash]
----
uv --directory solutions/2c-add-neo4j-connection run main.py
----
====


== Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, create a new directory for your MCP server, use the `uv init` command to initialize a new project:

[source,bash]
.Create a new project
----
mkdir server
cd server
uv init
----

Next, use the `uv add` command to install the required packages to your project:

[source,bash]
----
uv add mcp neo4j python-dotenv
----


== Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your `server/` directory with your Neo4j connection details:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.server/.env
----
NEO4J_URI={instance-scheme}://{instance-ip}:{instance-boltPort}
NEO4J_USERNAME={instance-username}
NEO4J_PASSWORD={instance-password}
NEO4J_DATABASE={instance-database}
----


[NOTE]
====
The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` so your credentials won't be committed to version control.
====


== Step 3: Implement Lifespan Management

Let's build the lifespan management step by step. First, create a new file `main.py` in your server directory and add the required imports:

[source,python]
.server/main.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/2c-add-neo4j-connection/main.py[tag=imports]
----


Next, create a context class to hold the Neo4j driver and database configuration:

[source,python]
.server/main.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/2c-add-neo4j-connection/main.py[tag=appcontext]
----


Now, implement the lifespan function that will manage the Neo4j driver:

[source,python]
.server/main.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/2c-add-neo4j-connection/main.py[tag=lifespan]
----


Then define a new `FastMCP` server instance with the name [copy]#Movies GraphRAG Server# and pass the `app_lifespan` function as the lifespan parameter.

[source,python]
.server/main.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/2c-add-neo4j-connection/main.py[tag=server]
----


== Step 4: Add a Graph Statistics Tool

Now that we have our lifespan management set up, let's create a tool to return the number of nodes and relationships in the graph.

Create a `graph_statistics` tool function that uses `ctx.request_context.lifespan_context` to access the driver and database from the lifespan context, then executes a Cypher query to count nodes and relationships:

[source,python]
.server/main.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/2c-add-neo4j-connection/main.py[tag=tool]
----

[TIP]
.Using the Database Configuration
====
The `database_` parameter is used to specify the database to execute the query on.
Any named arguments that do not end with an underscore will be passed as parameters to the Cypher query.

== Step 5: Add the Main Function

Finally, add the main function at the bottom of your `main.py` file to run the server:

[source,python]
.server/main.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/2c-add-neo4j-connection/main.py[tag=main]
----


== Step 6: Run the Server and Test with the Interactive Client

Now let's test your server with the interactive Python client.


=== Start the Server

First, start your MCP server in a terminal:

[source,shell]
----
uv --directory server run main.py
----

If the server starts successfully, you should see output similar to:

[source,output,role=nocopy]
----
INFO:     Started server process [92061]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
StreamableHTTP session manager started
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
----


=== Run the Interactive Client

In a separate terminal, start the MCP Inspector:

[source,bash]
----
uv --directory client run main.py
----

The client will display a menu of available tools. Select the `graph_statistics` tool and press Enter to execute it (this tool requires no parameters).

You should see the node and relationship counts from your database returned in the results:

[source,role=nocopy]
----
âœ¨ Result:
------------------------------------------------------------
{
  "nodes": 28863,
  "relationships": 332522
}
------------------------------------------------------------
----

[TIP]
.Troubleshooting
====
If you're having issues:

* Check that your `.env` file has the correct Neo4j credentials
* Verify the environment variables are being loaded (add print statements to debug)
* Ensure the Neo4j database is running and accessible
* Check the client output for error messages

[.summary]
== Summary

In this challenge, you successfully added lifespan management to your MCP server:

* **Package installation** - Added the `neo4j` and `python-dotenv` packages to your project
* **Environment variables** - Stored credentials in `.env` file and loaded them with `python-dotenv`
* **Lifespan function** - Created an async context manager to initialize and clean up the Neo4j driver
* **Context access** - Used `ctx.request_context.lifespan_context` to access the driver in tools
* **Connection testing** - Verified the connection works with the `graph_statistics` tool via the interactive client

Your server now properly manages the Neo4j driver lifecycle, creating it once on startup and reusing it across all tool calls.

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to add more advanced database features to your MCP server.
