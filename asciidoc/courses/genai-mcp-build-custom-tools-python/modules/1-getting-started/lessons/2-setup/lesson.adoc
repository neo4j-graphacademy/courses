= Setting Up Your Development Environment

We have created a GitHub Codespace for you to experiment with building MCP servers without any local setup required.

The Codespace comes pre-configured with Python, the MCP SDK, and all the tools you need. You'll just need to configure your Neo4j database credentials to get started.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to launch your Codespace and set up your environment variables.

[%collapsible]
.Develop on your local machine
====
You will need link:https://python.org[Python 3.10 or higher^] installed.

This course uses link:https://docs.astral.sh/uv/[uv^] as the Python package manager.
Install `uv` by following the link:https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/[installation instructions^].

Clone the link:{repository-link}[github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-mcp-build-custom-tools-python] repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-mcp-build-custom-tools-python
----

Navigate to the project directory:

[source,bash]
----
cd genai-mcp-build-custom-tools-python
----
====


== Explore the Repository

The repository contains a `server/` directory where you will build your MCP server.

Here are the important directories:

* `server/` - Your MCP server code will go here
* `client/` - An interactive Python client for testing your MCP server
* `solutions/` - Complete solutions for each of the challenges
* `.github/` - GitHub configuration including Codespace setup


== Set Up Environment Variables

Throughout this course, you'll connect your MCP server to a Neo4j database with real movie data.

We have created a Neo4j Sandbox instance for you to use during this course, loaded with thousands of movies, actors, directors, and user ratings.

To define the connection details as environment variables, create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory with the following values:


[source,env,subs="attributes+"]
.server/.env
----
NEO4J_URI={instance-scheme}://{instance-ip}:{instance-boltPort}
NEO4J_USERNAME={instance-username}
NEO4J_PASSWORD={instance-password}
NEO4J_DATABASE={instance-database}
----

// [NOTE]
// ====
// The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`, so your credentials won't be committed to version control.
// ====


=== Accessing Your Credentials

Your Neo4j Sandbox credentials are displayed above.

Simply copy each value and paste it into your `.env` file:

NEO4J_URI:: [copy]#bolt://{instance-ip}:{instance-boltPort}#
NEO4J_USERNAME:: [copy]#{instance-username}#
NEO4J_PASSWORD:: [copy]#{instance-password}#

[TIP]
.Have your own Neo4j Aura database?
====
If you have a link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/[Neo4j Aura^] database with the Recommendations dataset, you can use those credentials instead in your `.env` file.
====


== Verify Your Setup

To verify your setup, run the `test_environment.py` script.

[source,bash]
----
uv --directory client run test_environment.py
----


You should see an `OK` message if you have set up your environment correctly. If any tests fail, check the contents of the `.env` file.

[TIP]
.Accessing Environment Variables in Python
====
Throughout the course, you'll load environment variables using the link:https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/[`python-dotenv`^] package, and access them using Python's `os` module:

[source,python]
.Accessing environment variables
----
# load the .env file
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()


# access the environment variables
import os

uri = os.getenv("NEO4J_URI", "bolt://localhost:7687")
username = os.getenv("NEO4J_USERNAME", "neo4j")
password = os.getenv("NEO4J_PASSWORD", "password")
----
====
