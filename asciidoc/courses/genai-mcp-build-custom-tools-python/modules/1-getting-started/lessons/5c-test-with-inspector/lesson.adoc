= Test with Inspector
:type: challenge
:order: 5

In the previous lesson, you learned how to use the MCP Inspector to connect to your MCP server, explore its features, and test tools through a user-friendly UI. You saw how to launch the Inspector, connect to your MCP server via stdio, and run tools using the auto-generated form.

In this challenge, you will run your MCP server in GitHub Codespaces, launch the MCP Inspector, and use it to test your tool implementation.

To pass the challenge, you will need to:

1. Start your MCP server and the Inspector in a Codespaces environment.
2. Connect the Inspector to your running server.
3. Use the Inspector UI to run a tool and verify its output.

== Step 1: Start the Inspector and Server Together

Open a terminal in your Codespaces environment and run the following command from the project root:

[source,shell]
----
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory $PWD/server run main.py
----

This will launch both the MCP Inspector and your server. Wait for the Inspector to start and note the local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:6274).


== Step 2: Connect the Inspector to Your Server

Click on the URL to open up the server.
Codespaces will perform port forwarding to allow you to access the server from your browser.

In the left panel, ensure the Transport Type is set to `stdio` and the server command is pre-filled. Click **Connect**.


== Step 3: Run a Tool in the Inspector

Once connected, go to the **Tools** tab. Select your tool (e.g., `count_letters`), fill in the required parameters, and click **Run tool**. 

Does it work?

== Summary

In this challenge, you started your MCP server using the MCP Inspector in Codespaces, connected to your server, and ran a tool through the Inspector UI. You now have a repeatable workflow for testing and debugging your MCP tools interactively. 

In the next module, you will start to build our your MCP server with tools, resources and prompts.
