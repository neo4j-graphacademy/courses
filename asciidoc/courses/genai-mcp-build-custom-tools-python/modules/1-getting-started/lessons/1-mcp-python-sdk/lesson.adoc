= Building MCP servers
:type: lesson
:order: 1

In the link:/courses/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools/[Developing with Neo4j MCP Tools course], you learned the basics of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how to use the Neo4j Cypher MCP Server to enable AI agents to interact with Neo4j databases.

In this course, you will learn how to build your own MCP servers with graph-backed tools and resources, creating a complete GraphRAG application.

You will  learn to build these tools with the MCP Python SDK, and you will use the MCP Inspector to test your servers.

[TIP]
.Emerging standards
====
The Model Context Protocol is an emerging standard for connecting AI applications with tools and data sources. 
As such the protocol is still evolving, and the features taught in this course are subject to change.

You can follow link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/[the Model Context Protocol documentation^] to stay up to date with the latest changes.

== Understanding the MCP Python SDK

The MCP Python SDK is a comprehensive library that implements the full Model Context Protocol specification for Python applications.
It provides both client and server implementations, making it easy to create MCP servers that expose custom functionality to AI agents.


The SDK includes two main approaches for building servers:

* **FastMCP**: A high-level, decorator-based approach that makes it simple to create servers quickly
* **Low-level server**: A more flexible approach that gives you full control over the MCP protocol

In this course, we will focus on the FastMCP approach.


== Installing the MCP Python SDK

To get started building MCP servers, you need to install the MCP Python SDK package.

You can install it using pip:

[source,bash]
----
pip install mcp
----

This package includes both the core MCP functionality and the FastMCP high-level interface.


== Introducing FastMCP

FastMCP is the high-level interface in the MCP Python SDK designed to make server development as simple as possible.  FastMCP is built on top of the FastAPI framework, and uses a decorator approach to defining MCP features.


== Core MCP Features

MCP servers expose three types of features to clients. Let's take a look at each one and when to use them.

=== 1. Tools

**Tools** are functions that LLMs can call to perform actions or retrieve data. They are perfect for tasks that LLMs struggle with, like counting or complex calculations.

**Characteristics:**

* Called by the LLM (model-controlled)
* Can have side effects (create, update, delete)
* Can perform computation
* Return structured results

**Use tools when:**

* You need to execute code or query a database
* The action depends on user input or context
* You want the LLM to decide when to use it
* You need deterministic results

Here's a simple example of a tool that helps LLMs with counting - a task they typically struggle with:

[source,python]
----
@mcp.tool()
def count_letters(text: str, search: str) -> int:
    """
    Count occurrences of a letter in the text.
    Use this tool when you need to find how many times a substring appears in a text.
    """
    return text.lower().count(search.lower())
----

=== 2. Resources

**Resources** expose data that can be loaded into the LLM's context, similar to a REST API endpoint.

**Characteristics:**

* Accessed by the client application (application-controlled)
* Read-only (no side effects)
* Typically static or parameterized URIs
* Provide context for the LLM

**Use resources when:**

* You want to expose data that doesn't change often
* The client decides what to load (not the LLM)
* You're providing reference information or documentation
* You need to expose specific entities by ID

Example of a resource with a parameterized URI:

[source,python]
----
@mcp.resource("greeting://{name}")
def get_greeting(name: str) -> str:
    """Get a personalized greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
----

=== 3. Prompts

**Prompts** are pre-defined templates that help users interact with your server effectively.

**Characteristics:**

* Invoked by the user (user-controlled)
* Provide reusable templates
* Can accept parameters
* Guide the conversation

**Use prompts when:**

* You want to provide common workflows
* Users need help formulating requests
* You want to standardize interactions
* You need to ensure consistent input format

Example of a prompt template:

[source,python]
----
@mcp.prompt(title="Count Letters")
def count_letters_prompt(text: str, search: str) -> str:
    """Template for counting letter occurrences."""
    return f"Count the occurrences of the letter '{search}' in the text:\n\n{text}"
----

=== Putting It All Together

Here's a complete example showing all three features working together:

[source,python]
.server.py
----
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP 

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Text Analysis Server")  # <1>

# Tool for deterministic counting
@mcp.tool()  # <2>
def count_letters(text: str, search: str) -> int:
    """Count occurrences of a letter in the text."""
    return text.lower().count(search.lower()) 

# Resource for reference data
@mcp.resource("greeting://{name}")  # <3>
def get_greeting(name: str) -> str:
    """Get a personalized greeting"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Prompt template for common task
@mcp.prompt(title="Count Letters")  # <4>
def count_letters_prompt(text: str, search: str) -> str:
    """Template for letter counting task."""
    return f"Count the occurrences of the letter '{search}' in the text:\n\n{text}"
----

This code demonstrates:

1. Creating a FastMCP server instance
2. A tool that performs deterministic counting
3. A resource that provides parameterized data
4. A prompt that helps users formulate requests

== Using Decorators 

The code sample uses decorators to register functions as MCP features. 
Let's take a closer look at the tool example: 

[source,python]
.server.py
----
@mcp.tool()
def count_letters(text: str, search: str) -> int:
    """
    Count occurrences of a letter in the text.
    Use this tool when you need to find how many times a substring appears in a text.
    """
    return text.lower().count(search.lower()) 
----

The `@mcp.tool()` decorator tells the server that the `count_letters` function should be used as an MCP tool.
Reflection is then used to infer metadata about the tool. 

1. The tool has two inputs: `text` and `search`, both of which are typed as strings.
2. The output of the tool is an `int`
3. The string in the opening line is used to  describe what the tool does and and when it should be used.

The `@mcp.tool()` decorator accepts a number of optional arguments, which we will cover later in the course.


== Running the server 

To run the server, you can call the `run` method on your `FastMCP` instance. 

[source,python]
.server.py
----
# ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
----

This method starts the MCP server using the `stdio` transport method by default and begins listening for incoming connections from MCP clients.


[TIP]
.Using the `fastmcp` command
====

You can also run the server from the command line using the `fastmcp` command.

[source,bash]
----
fastmcp run server.py
----

link:https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp[Learn more about `fastmcp`].
====


=== Transport methods 

In the previous course, we also covered the different transport methods that can be used to connect to an MCP server; Standard Input/Output (`stdio`), and Streamable HTTP (`http`).
As we will develop a local MCP server in this course, we will focus on the `stdio` transport method.  You can change the transport method by passing the `transport` parameter to the `run` method.

[source,python]
----
mcp.run(
    transport="http", 
    host="127.0.0.1", 
    port=8000, 
    path="/mcp"
)
----

Streaming HTTP is recommended for web deployments.  

[TIP]
.The `fastmcp` command line tool
====
You can also provide the `--transport`, `--host`, `--port`, and `--path` flags to the `fastmcp` command.
