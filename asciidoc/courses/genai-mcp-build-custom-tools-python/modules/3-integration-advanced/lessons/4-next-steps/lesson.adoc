Congratulations on completing "Building Custom MCP Tools with Python"!

Throughout this course, you've built a complete MCP server that connects Neo4j graph databases with AI tools using the Model Context Protocol.


== Understanding MCP Fundamentals

You now know how to:

* Create MCP servers using the FastMCP framework
* Define tools that AI assistants can call
* Expose resources through URI patterns
* Create prompts for guided user interactions
* Test your server with the MCP Inspector


== Working with Neo4j

You've learned to:

* Connect to Neo4j using lifespan management
* Query graphs with the Neo4j Python driver
* Handle database connections securely with environment variables
* Access the driver through the Context object
* Write efficient Cypher queries


== Building Production-Ready Tools

You've mastered:

* Implementing pagination for large datasets
* Adding logging and progress reporting
* Handling errors gracefully
* Validating inputs and queries
* Structuring responses consistently


== Creating Deterministic Workflows

You can now:

* Use MCP tools to explore graph schemas
* Validate Cypher statements before implementation
* Transform probabilistic AI suggestions into reliable code
* Build tools that generate and test queries systematically


== Pro Tips

=== Performance

* Use lifespan management for connection pooling
* Implement pagination for queries that return many results
* Add proper indexes to support your query patterns

=== Security

* Never hardcode credentials
* Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
* Validate all user inputs before querying

=== Best Practices

* Test queries with MCP tools before implementing them
* Add comprehensive logging for debugging
* Use the Context object for progress reporting
* Return structured data for easier consumption
