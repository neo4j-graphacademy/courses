= Advanced MCP Features
:type: lesson
:order: 3


The MCP Python SDK offers two advanced features for building more sophisticated servers: **Sampling** and **Completions**.


== Sampling: Dynamic LLM Interactions

Sampling allows your tools to call the LLM during execution. Instead of just returning data from the database, a tool can ask the LLM that powers the Agent to transform, explain, or enhance that data.

For example, a tool could retrieve movie information from Neo4j and then ask the LLM to convert the strctured data into a natural language description:

[source,python]
----
@mcp.tool()
async def explain_movie_data(movie_title: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Get a natural language explanation of movie data."""
    
    # Get movie data from Neo4j
    movie_data = await get_movie_details(movie_title, ctx)
    
    # Ask LLM to explain the data
    result = await ctx.session.create_message(
        messages=[
            SamplingMessage(
                role="user",
                content=TextContent(
                    text=f"Describe {movie_data['title']} ({movie_data['released']}) " +
                         f"starring {', '.join(movie_data['actors'])}. " +
                         "Write 2-3 engaging sentences."
                )
            )
        ],
        max_tokens=200
    )
    
    return result.content.text if result.content.type == "text" else str(result.content)
----

Use sampling when you need:

* Natural language generation from structured data
* Dynamic summaries based on query results
* Content that adapts to the specific data retrieved
* Recommendations or insights derived from data

[NOTE]
====
Sampling requires client support and adds processing overhead. The client must support the sampling capability for this feature to work.

== Completions: Smart Parameter Suggestions

Completions provide autocomplete suggestions when users are filling in tool parameters or resource URIs. This helps users discover valid values without memorizing them.

For example, when a user starts typing a genre name, completions can suggest matching options from the database:

[source,python]
----
@server.complete()
async def handle_completion(
    ref: types.PromptReference | types.ResourceReference,
    argument: types.CompleteArgument
) -> CompleteResult:
    """Provide genre completions."""
    
    if argument.name == "genre":
        records, _, _ = await driver.execute_query(
            """
            MATCH (g:Genre) 
            WHERE g.name STARTS WITH $prefix
            RETURN g.name AS name 
            ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 10
            """,
            prefix=argument.value
        )
        
        return CompleteResult(
            completion=Completion(
                values=[record["label"] for record in records]
            )
        )
    
    return CompleteResult(completion=Completion(values=[]))
----

Use completions when:

* Users need to discover valid parameter values
* Your tools accept specific values from a dataset
* You want to improve user experience with suggestions
* Form-based interfaces benefit from autocomplete

[NOTE]
====
Completions require using the low-level `Server` API instead of FastMCP's decorator-based approach.

== Choosing Advanced Features

Both features are optional and add complexity. Consider them when:

* Building user-facing tools where experience matters
* The benefit justifies the implementation cost
* Your client supports these capabilities

Always check client support before using advanced features:

[source,python]
----
if ctx.session.client_params.capabilities.sampling:
    # Use sampling
else:
    # Provide simpler alternative
----

== Summary

Advanced MCP features can enhance your server's capabilities:

* **Sampling** - Dynamic content generation through LLM interactions
* **Completions** - Smart parameter suggestions for better UX
* **Implementation Notes** - Check client support and consider performance impact
