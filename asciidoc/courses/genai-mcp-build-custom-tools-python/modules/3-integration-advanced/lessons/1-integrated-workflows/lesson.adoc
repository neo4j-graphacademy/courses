= Integrated Workflows
:type: lesson
:order: 1


You've built a complete MCP server with tools, resources, prompts, and pagination. Now it's time to use these tools to build even better tools - a concept known as **meta-programming**. Your MCP server can query schemas, generate and validate Cypher queries, and help build new tools, making development faster and more sophisticated.

== Building Tools with AI Assistance

Instead of manually exploring schemas, writing queries, and debugging code, you can use your MCP tools with AI to automate the development process. For example, to create a tool that finds actors who worked with a specific director, simply ask the AI to help. It will use your tools to explore the schema, generate and validate the Cypher query, and write the complete Python function.


== Using Cursor Rules

Configure link:https://cursor.sh[Cursor^] to use your MCP tools through rules in `.cursor/rules/mcp-neo4j.md`:

# Neo4j MCP Server Integration

## Available Tools
- **neo4j_schema**: Get database schema (labels, relationships, properties)
- **neo4j_query**: Execute and validate Cypher queries

## Best Practices
- Start with schema exploration
- Test queries before implementation
- Avoid OPTIONAL MATCH unless absolutely necessary. Use list comprehension in the RETURN clause instead.
- Add ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses
- Use parameters ($param)
- Include logging and error handling

## Example Usage
"Create a tool to find movies with a specific actor"
1. Check schema: Person-[:ACTED_IN]->Movie
2. Test query: MATCH (p:Person {name: $name})-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) RETURN m.title AS title, r.role AS role
3. Generate Python function with proper structure

These rules help Cursor generate reliable code by following the deterministic workflow.


== Iterative Development

The ultimate example of MCP's power is transforming probabilistic AI responses into deterministic graph development. This process eliminates uncertainty through a structured workflow.

1. **Schema Understanding** - Use Neo4j MCP tools to understand the structure of the graph
2. **Query Validation** - Write Cypher statements that answer specific questions and execute the queries on the graph to validate the results
3. **Implementation** - Use the cypher statements to build tools within the project

Rather than relying on probabilistic AI responses, or generating the same Cypher statements over and over, you can use LLMs to build tools, verify the results, and implement the tools within the project.

Each step builds on verified information from the previous step, creating a reliable chain of development. This transforms potentially unreliable AI suggestions into production-ready code through systematic validation.

== Summary

MCP transforms graph development by providing:

* **Deterministic Workflow** - Schema understanding → Query validation → Implementation
* **Systematic Validation** - Each step verified through MCP tools
* **Reliable Results** - From probabilistic AI suggestions to production-ready code
