This course follows on from the link:/courses/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools/[Developing with Neo4j MCP Tools course], which introduces the Model Context Protocol and key concepts like Servers, Clients and Tools.

In this course, you will build on that knowledge to create your own MCP server using the link:https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk[MCP Python SDK^] and create server features that can be consumed by any MCP client.



== Prerequisites

This course assumes that you have are familiar with the basics of Generative AI and Large Language Models. If you are not, we recommend that you take the link:/courses/genai-fundamentals/[GenAI Fundamentals] and link:/courses/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools/[Developing with Neo4j MCP Tools] courses first.

We also assume a basic understanding of Python and command line tools.  We assume that you have Python installed along with the `uv` package manager.
If you are not familiar with uv, you should also link:https://docs.astral.sh/uv/[review the uv documentation].


The course features hands-on challenges using link:https://github.com/settings/copilot[GitHub CoPilot^], you will need to enable either the free or Pro version.
