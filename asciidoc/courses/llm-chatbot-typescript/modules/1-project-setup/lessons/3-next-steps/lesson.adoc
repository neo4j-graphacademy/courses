With the initial setup complete, it's time to dive into the heart of this course: developing a movie recommendation chatbot. This innovative tool will leverage information from a Neo4j database to deliver accurate and engaging recommendations.

== Your Objective

In the upcoming modules, you'll embark on a project to create a chatbot capable of suggesting movies based on user queries. This involves:

// * TODO: Diagram of how the app will be architected
// 1. User input, received by the API
// 2. Get conversation history from the database
// 3. Rephrase the question into a standalone question - saves tokens
// 4. Agent selects the tool
//    ** retrieval qa chain for semantic search on movie plots
//    ** cypher qa chain for quantitive & more complex questions
// 5. Answer generation chain
// 6. Save response to the database
// 7. Return the response back to the user

You will modify the `call()` function in link:{lab}[`{lab-filename}`^] to call a new Chain.

lab::Open `{lab-filename}`[]

The function will:

1. Accept the user input as a string along with a Session ID generated by the framework
2. Use any conversation history to rephrase the input into a standalone question
3. Pass the rephrased question to an **Agent** that will be responsible for selecting the correct tool to satisfy the request


== Foundation Tools

You will build the following tools:

* `RetrievalChain` - A tool that uses a **Retriever** to search the vector index of embedded movie plots to find movies that match a particular theme, for example: _"Can you recommend a movie about ghosts?"_.
* `CypherChain` - A tool capable of writing Cypher and executing statements for more complicated questions, for example: _"Who has acted in Movies with Tom Hanks?"_

The tools will also be responsible for saving the LLM's response and associated metadata to the database.  You will use this information to improve future responses generated by the LLM.

These chains will be used to supply an LLM with the information required to hold a conversation with the user.

== Summary

In this lesson, we covered the architecture that you will create as you progress through the course.

In the next module, you will be introduced to LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and build your first chains.
