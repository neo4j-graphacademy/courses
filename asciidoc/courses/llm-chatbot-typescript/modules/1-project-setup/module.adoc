= Getting Started

As you progress through this course, you will modify a link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/llm-chatbot-typescript[pre-built repository^] to build a chatbot.

You can either complete the challenges locally or complete the course using an online IDE.

At the end of the course, you will have a template that can be used for your future Generative AI Projects.

In this first module, you will get the project up and running.

If you're ready, let's get building!
