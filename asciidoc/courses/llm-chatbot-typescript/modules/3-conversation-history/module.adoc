:order: 3

The first step of your agent module will be to use the conversation history to rephrase the current input into a standalone question.

In this module, we will first cover the theory behind this approach before creating a chain capable of rephrasing the question based on conversation history.

* Store conversation history in Neo4j
* Build chains that use history to rephrase questions
