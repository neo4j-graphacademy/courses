= Verifying the Test

If every test in the test suite has passed, a new `(:Session)` node with a `.id` property of `cypher-retriever-3` will have been created in your database.

The session should have atleast one `(:Response)` node, linked with a `:CONTEXT` relationship to a movie with the title `Neo4j - Into the Graph`.


Click the **Check Database** button below to verify the tests have succeeded.

.Solution
====
You can compare your code with link:{lab}[the solution in `{lab-solution}`^] and double-check that the conditions have been met in link:{repository-blob}/main/{test-file}[the test suite^].

You can also run the following Cypher statement to double-check that the index has been created in your database.
