= Cypher Retrieval Tool

In this module, you will tackle the Cypher Retrieval Tool.
The Cypher Retrieval Tool is more complicated than the Vector Retrieval tool you built in the last module.

The Cypher Retrieval Tool will be responsible for generating a Cypher statement that answers the rephrased question, evaluating that the Cypher is both semantically and syntactically correct, fetching the results and storing the information in the database.

// * Cypher Generation
// ** Generation Chain
// ** Evaluating Cypher

// ** Few-shot prompting
// ** Saving suggested nodes

Are are ready?   Let's go!
