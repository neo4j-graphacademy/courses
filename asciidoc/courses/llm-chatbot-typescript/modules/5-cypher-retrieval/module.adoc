= Cypher Retrieval Tool
:order: 5

In this module, you will tackle the Cypher Retrieval Tool.
// The Cypher Retrieval Tool is more complicated than the Vector Retrieval tool you built in the last module.

The Cypher Retrieval Tool will be responsible for generating a Cypher statement that answers the rephrased question, evaluating that the Cypher is both semantically and syntactically correct, fetching the results and storing the information in the database.

// * Cypher Generation
// ** Generation Chain
// ** Evaluating Cypher
// ** Providing Specific Instructions
// ** Few-shot prompting
// ** Saving suggested nodes

Are are ready?   Let's go!
