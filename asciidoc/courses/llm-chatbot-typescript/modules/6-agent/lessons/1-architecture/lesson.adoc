= Agent Architecture
:type: lesson
:order: 1

Alright!  Congratulations on making it this far!

Here is where we bring everything together into a single agent.
Before jumping in let's recap how the agent will work.

// TODO: Diagram

== Tools

As you learned in link:/courses/llm-fundamentals/[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^], the term Agent describes a callable interface that provides an LLM with access to a set of tools.
These tools may access additional data sources, APIs, or functionality. The model is used to determine which of the tools to use to complete a task.

In this case, we have two tools suitable for distinct tasks.

1. The link:../../4-vector-retrieval/[Vector Retrieval Chain from Module 4^] searches embeddings of movie plots to find movies based on a text input.  For example, _"recommend me a movie about a love story that ends in tragedy"_.
2. For more complex queries, the link:../../4-vector-retrieval/[Cypher Retrieval Chain from Module 5^] will use the schema to generate a Cypher statement that answers a question.  For example, _"Who directed Toy Story?"_ or _"What was the average user rating of La La Land?"_

The LLM will use descriptions of these tools to decide which tool is most appropriate for performing the task.

These chains expect an object containing an `input` and `rephrasedQuestion` and return a string.


== Memory

Our Agent will also be capable of simulating a real conversation by recalling the conversation history and rephrasing the current user input.

The agent must perform this step before the agent selecting which tool to use.


== Process

Therefore, the agent chain should adhere to the following steps:

1. A `Runnable` sequence receives the user's input
2. The sequence gets any recent conversation history from the database
3. The history is used to re-phrase the input into a standalone question
4. The standalone question is passed to the agent executor, which will select a tool, invoke it, and return a string response.


== Ready?

Now we have covered the architecture, it's time to build.

== Summary

In this lesson, we discussed the agent's architecture and outlined how the agent will work.

In the next lesson, you will define the tools available to the agent.
