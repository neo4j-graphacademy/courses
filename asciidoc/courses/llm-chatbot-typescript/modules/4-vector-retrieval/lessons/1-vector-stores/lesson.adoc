In the link:../../2-chains/2-answer-generation/[Answer Generation Chain lesson^], you built a chain that answers a question based on the context provided in the prompt.

As we covered in the link:/courses/llm-fundamentals/2-vectors-semantic-search[Retrievers lesson of Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^], semantic search in LangChain is performed using an object called a **Retriever**.

A Retriever is an abstraction that uses a **Vector Store** to identify similar documents based on an input by converting the input into a vector embedding and performing a similarity search against the vectors stored in an index.

To pass this challenge, you must modify the `initVectorStore()` function in `{lab-file}` to create a new `Neo4jVectorStore` instance.

lab::Open `{lab-filename}`[]

== Set up the Vector Index

First, you must create a vector index in your Sandbox instance to use a Vector Store.

Run the `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` command below to create a vector index called `moviePlots` if it does not already exist.

.Create Vector Index
[source,cypher]
----
include::./solution.cypher[tag=setup]
----

The statement creates a new index called `moviePlots`, indexing the vectors in the `embedding`  property.
The vectors stored in the `embedding` property have been created using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model and therefore have `1536` dimensions.
The index will use `cosine` similarity to identify similar documents.

To learn more about how Vector Retrievers work, link:/courses/llm-fundamentals/3-intro-to-langchain/6-retrievers/[see the Retrievers lesson in Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^].

Next, run the following statement to load a CSV file containing embeddings of movie plots.

include::./solution.cypher[tag=import]

== Creating a Store

Inside `{lab-file}`, you will find an `initVectorStore()` function.

.initVectorStore
[source,typescript]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/{lab-file}[tag=function]
----

Inside this function, use the `Neo4jVectorStore.fromExistingIndex()` method to create a new vector store instance.

.Using an existing index
[source,typescript]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/{lab-solution}[tag=store, indent=0]
----

[TIP]
.Document Metadata
====
You may have noticed the `retrievalQuery` argument defined when creating the `vectorStore` variable.
The `metadata` object allows you to return additional information that could help improve the LLM response.

In this case, the title is returned with the names of actors and directors and a canonical link to the movie on The Movie Database (TMDB).

The `_id` property will contain the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-elementid[Element ID^] for each source document in the database.
You will use these IDs to create relationships that provide transparency on the context provided to help the LLM generate its response.
====

Finally, return the `vectorStore` from the function.

.Returning the vector store
[source,typescript]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/{lab-solution}[tag=return,indent=0]
----

If you have followed the steps correctly, your code should resemble the following:

== Summary

In this lesson, you wrote the code to save and retrieve conversation history in a Neo4j database.

In the next lesson, you will construct a chain that will take this history to rephrase the user's input into a standalone question.
