Use MERGE to create Person nodes from the CSV file.

Note that all properties are strings.

Understand how to use data in the CSV file to create nodes

In this lesson, you will learn how to use the MERGE clause to create nodes from a CSV file.

You will load a CSV file of "person" data into `Person` nodes in Neo4j. The CSV file contains the following fields:

* `person_tmdbId`
* `bio`
* `born`
* `bornIn` 
* `died`
* `person_imdb`
* `Id`
* `name`
* `person_poster` 
* `person_url`

== Load the CSV file

. Download the link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/persons.csv[persons.csv] file, opening it using a text editor and look at the contents.
+
image::images/persons_notepad.png[persons.csv file open in Notepad,width=500,align=center]
. You should see that the file contains headers, and the field delimiter is a comma (`,`).
. Run the following Cypher statement to load the CSV file and return the contents: 
+
[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/persons.csv" AS row
RETURN row
----

== Create Person nodes

Run the following Cypher statement to create `Person` nodes from the CSV file:

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/persons.csv" AS row
MERGE (p:Person {tmdbId: toInteger(row.person_tmdbId)})
SET
p.imdbId = toInteger(row.person_imdbId),
p.bornIn = row.bornIn,
p.name = row.name,
p.bio = row.bio,
p.poster = row.poster,
p.url = row.url,
p.born = row.born,
p.died = row.died
----

TODO - GOTO HERE

Confirm the data is in the graph by running the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p LIMIT 25
----

Breaking down the import Cypher statement:

* MERGE to create rows
* Use toInteger to convert the id's into integers
* Use SET to set the properties of the node to the value of the corresponding field in the CSV file
