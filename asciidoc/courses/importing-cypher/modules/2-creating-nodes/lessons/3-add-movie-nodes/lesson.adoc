= Adding Movie Nodes
:order: 3
:type: challenge

To complete this challenge, you will need to:

. Review the https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/movies.csv[movies.csv] file and the data it contains.
. Create a constraint to ensure that there are no duplicate movies.
. Construct a Cypher statement to load the CSV file and create the Movie nodes.

== Movie data

Open and review the link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/movies.csv[movies.csv] CSV file. The file uses a comma as a field delimiter, contains headers and the following fields:

* movieId
* title
* budget
* countries
* movie_imdbId
* imdbRating
* imdbVotes
* languages
* plot
* movie_poster
* released
* revenue
* runtime
* movie_tmdbId
* movie_url
* year
* genres

== Creating the constraint

The `movieId` field is unique for each movie. 

You should create a constraint named `Movie_movieId` to ensure this property is unique for each `Movie` node.

== Load the Movie nodes

You should construct a Cypher to:

. Load the link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/movies.csv[movies.csv] CSV file from https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/movies.csv
. Create the `Movie` nodes using `MERGE` with the `movieId` field as the unique identifier.
. Set the following properties on the `Movie` nodes:
* `tmdbId` 
* `imdbId`
* `released` 
* `title` 
* `year` 
* `plot`
* `budget`

[NOTE]
.Additional fields and data types
Later in the course, you modify the import process to include the additional fields and cast relevant data types.

The import should create 93 `Movie` nodes.

It is a good idea to inspect the data after import. Run the following Cypher statement for return the first 25 `Movie` nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN count(m) LIMIT 25
----
