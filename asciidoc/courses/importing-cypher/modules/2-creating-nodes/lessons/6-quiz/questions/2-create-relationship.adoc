= 2. Creating relationship properties

The `flights.csv` data file contains information about flights between airports. The following Cypher statement will create `FLIGHT` relationships between `Airport` nodes based on the data in the `flights.csv` file.

Select the correct Cypher statement to add the `airline` property to the relationship.

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS 'file:///flights.csv' AS row
MATCH (d:Airport {airport_code: row.departure_airport})
MATCH (a:Airport {airport_code: row.arrival_airport})
MERGE (d)-[f:FLIGHT {flight_number: row.flight_number}]->(a)
/*select:SET d.airline = row.airline*/
----

* [ ] SET d.airline = row.airline
* [x] SET f.airline = row.airline
* [ ] SET a.airline = row.airline

.Hint
====
The `airline` property is against the relationship, not the departure or arrival airport.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====

The `FLIGHT` relationship is between the `Airport` nodes `d` and `a`, and the `airline` property should be set against the relationship `f`.
