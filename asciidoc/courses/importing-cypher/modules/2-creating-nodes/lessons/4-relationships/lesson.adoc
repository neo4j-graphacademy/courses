== Creating relationships

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv[`acted_in.csv`] file contains the following data:

* movieId - the `movieId` property of the `Movie` node
* person_tmdbId - the `tmbdId` property of the `Person` node
* role - the role the person played in the movie

To create the `ACTED_IN` relationship, you will need to:

. `LOAD CSV` data from the link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv[`acted_in.csv`] and link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/directed.csv[`directed.csv`] files.
. `MATCH` the relevant `Person` and `Movie` nodes.
. Use `MERGE` to create the `ACTED_IN` relationship between the matched `Person` and `Movie` nodes.

Review the Cypher statement below, which creates the `ACTED_IN` relationships between the `Person` and `Movie` nodes.

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv' AS row
MATCH (p:Person {tmdbId: toInteger(row.person_tmdbId)})
MATCH (m:Movie {movieId: toInteger(row.movieId)})
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m)
SET r.role = row.role
----

Try to identify:

* The 2 `MATCH` clauses that find the appropriate `Person` and `Movie` nodes using the `movieId` and `person_tmdbId` properties.
* The `MERGE` clause that creates the `ACTED_IN` relationship between the matched `p` and `m` nodes 
* The `SET` clause that sets the `role` property of the `ACTED_IN` relationship `r`.

This approach of `MATCH`ing 2 nodes and `MERGE`ing a relationship between them is a typical Cypher pattern.

== ACTED_IN relationship

Run the Cypher statement to create the `ACTED_IN` relationships.

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv' AS row
MATCH (p:Person {tmdbId: toInteger(row.person_tmdbId)})
MATCH (m:Movie {movieId: toInteger(row.movieId)})
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m)
SET r.role = row.role
----

To verify that you created the `ACTED_IN` relationships successfully, run the following Cypher statement to find people who acted in movies`:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) RETURN p, r, m LIMIT 25
----

== DIRECTED relationships

Your challenge is to write a similar Cypher statement to create the `DIRECTED` relationship between the `Person` and `Movie` nodes.

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/directed.csv[`directed.csv`] file contains just the `movieId` and `person_tmdbId` IDs.

Unlike the `ACTED_IN` relationship, the `DIRECTED` relationship has no properties (e.g. `role`), so you will not need to use the `SET` clause.

To verify that you created the `DIRECTED` relationship successfully, run the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie) RETURN p, r, m LIMIT 25
----

[TIP]
.Directed and acted in
====
Once you have created the `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships, you can use the data to find people who directed and acted in the same movie.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person)
RETURN p, m
----
====
