== Creating relationships

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv[`acted_in.csv`^] file contains the following data:

* movieId - the `movieId` property of the `Movie` node
* person_tmdbId - the `tmbdId` property of the `Person` node
* role - the role the person played in the movie

To create the `ACTED_IN` relationship, you will need to:

. `LOAD CSV` data from the link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv[`acted_in.csv`^] file.
. `MATCH` the relevant `Person` and `Movie` nodes.
. Use `MERGE` to create the `ACTED_IN` relationship between the matched `Person` and `Movie` nodes.

Review the Cypher statement below, which creates the `ACTED_IN` relationships between the `Person` and `Movie` nodes.

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv' AS row
MATCH (p:Person {tmdbId: toInteger(row.person_tmdbId)})
MATCH (m:Movie {movieId: toInteger(row.movieId)})
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m)
SET r.role = row.role
----

Try to identify:

* The 2 `MATCH` clauses that find the appropriate `Person` and `Movie` nodes using the `movieId` and `person_tmdbId` properties.
* The `MERGE` clause that creates the `ACTED_IN` relationship between the matched `p` and `m` nodes 
* The `SET` clause that sets the `role` property of the `ACTED_IN` relationship `r`.

This approach of `MATCH`ing 2 nodes and `MERGE`ing a relationship between them is a typical Cypher pattern.

== ACTED_IN relationship

Run the Cypher statement to create the `ACTED_IN` relationships.

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv' AS row
MATCH (p:Person {tmdbId: toInteger(row.person_tmdbId)})
MATCH (m:Movie {movieId: toInteger(row.movieId)})
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m)
SET r.role = row.role
----

To verify that you created the `ACTED_IN` relationships successfully, run the following Cypher statement to find people who acted in movies:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) RETURN p, r, m LIMIT 25
----

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create relationships between nodes from data in a CSV file.

In the next lesson, you will create the `DIRECTED` relationship between the `Person` and `Movie nodes`
