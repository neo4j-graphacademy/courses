= Unique IDs and Constraints
:order: 2
:type: lesson
:sandbox: true

A Neo4j best practice is to use an ID as a unique property value for each node.

Unique IDs help ensure duplicate data is not created. When you load data from CSV files, you rely heavily upon the IDs specified in the file. If the IDs in your CSV file are not unique for the same entity (node), you could create duplicate data. You may also have problems loading the data and creating relationships between nodes.

You can add constraints to your database to stop the creation of nodes with duplicate IDs. 

== Create a unique constraint

The syntax for creating a unique constraint on a property is:

[source, cypher, role=noplay nocopy]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName)
REQUIRE n.propertyName IS UNIQUE
----

The constraint is for a property on all nodes with a specified label.

The `constraint_name` is optional, but it is good practice to specify one. If you do not specify a constraint name, Neo4j will create one for you. 

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause is also optional - if not used Neo4j will generate an error if the constraint already exists.

== Person node constraint

The `Person` nodes you created should all have a unique `tmbdId` property. 

You can create a constraint for the `tmdbId` property to ensure that all `Person` nodes have a unique `tmdbId` property value.

Review the following Cypher statement.

[source, cypher, role=noplay nocopy]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT Person_tmdbId IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (x:Person) 
REQUIRE x.tmdbId IS UNIQUE
----

You should note that:

* The constraint name is `Person_tmdbId`.
* The optional clause `IF NOT EXISTS` is used - without which Neo4j would raise an error if the constraint exists.
* It applies to all nodes with the `Person` label.
* It requires the `tmdbId` property to be unique.

Run the Cypher statement to create the constraint:
 
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT Person_tmdbId
FOR (x:Person) 
REQUIRE x.tmdbId IS UNIQUE
----

You can check that the constraint has been created by running the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
SHOW CONSTRAINTS
----

You should see the constraint named `Person_tmdbId` in the results.

If you try to create a `Person` node with a duplicate `tmdbId` property value, Neo4j will raise an error.

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (p:Person {tmdbId: 3}) RETURN p
----

[source]
----
Node(0) already exists with label `Person` and property `tmdbId` = 3
----

[NOTE]
.Drop a constraint
====
If you need to drop a constraint, use the following Cypher statement.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT [constraint_name]
----

In this lesson, you learned how to create a unique constraint on a property.

In the next lesson, you will load a CSV file of movies and create `Movie` nodes.
