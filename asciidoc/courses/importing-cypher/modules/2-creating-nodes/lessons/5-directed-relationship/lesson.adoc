= DIRECTED relationship
:order: 5
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

To complete this challenge, you will need to create the `DIRECTED` relationships between the `Person` and Movie nodes.

== DIRECTED relationships

Your challenge is to write a Cypher statement to create the `DIRECTED` relationship between the `Person` and `Movie` nodes.

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/directed.csv[`directed.csv`^] file contains just the `movieId` and `person_tmdbId` IDs.

Unlike the `ACTED_IN` relationship, the `DIRECTED` relationship has no properties (e.g. `role`), so you will not need to use the `SET` clause.

[NOTE]
.ACTED_IN relationship
====
Here is the Cypher you used to create to the `ACTED_IN` relationship.

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/acted_in.csv' AS row
MATCH (p:Person {tmdbId: toInteger(row.person_tmdbId)})
MATCH (m:Movie {movieId: toInteger(row.movieId)})
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m)
SET r.role = row.role
----
====

To verify that you created the `DIRECTED` relationship successfully, run the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie) RETURN p, r, m LIMIT 25
----

[TIP]
.Directed and acted in
====
Once you have created the `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships, you can use the data to find people who directed and acted in the same movie.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person)
RETURN p, m
----

== Summary

In this lesson, you created the Cypher to create the `DIRECTED` relationship between the `Person` and `Movie nodes`.

In the next lesson, you will complete a quiz on the lessons from this module.
