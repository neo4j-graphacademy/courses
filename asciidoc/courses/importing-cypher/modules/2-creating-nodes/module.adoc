= Creating Nodes, Properties, and Relationships
:order: 2

== Module Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

* Creating nodes and relationships with data from a CSV file
* Assigning properties to nodes and relationships
* The importance of unique identifiers and how to create constraints

You will load data about movies and people related to those movies, including `Person` and `Movie` nodes, relationships between them, and constraints to ensure the data is unique.
