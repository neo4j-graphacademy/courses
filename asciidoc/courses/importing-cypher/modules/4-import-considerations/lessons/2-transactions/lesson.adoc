= Transactions

:type: lesson

The Cypher queries you have written will run within a single transaction. As a result, the data is rolled back if a failure occurs; and the graph is unchanged.

Importing significant volumes of data in a single transaction can result in large write operations - this can cause performance issues and potential failure. 

You can split a query into multiple transactions using the `CALL` clause with `IN TRANSACTIONS`.

[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
CALL {
  // query
} IN TRANSACTIONS [OF X ROWS]
----

For example, the following query would create the `Person` nodes in individual transactions.

[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
CALL { 
    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS 
    FROM "https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/persons.csv" 
    AS row
    MERGE (p:Person {tmdbId: toInteger(row.person_tmdbId)})
    SET
    p.imdbId = toInteger(row.person_imdbId),
    p.bornIn = row.bornIn,
    p.name = row.name,
    p.bio = row.bio,
    p.poster = row.poster,
    p.url = row.url,
    p.born = date(row.born),
    p.died = date(row.died);
} IN TRANSACTIONS
----

You can batch the transactions by specifying the number of rows to process in each transaction. 

For example, modifying the query above to process 100 rows in each transaction:

[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 100 ROWS
----

In this lesson, you learned how to split a query into multiple transactions using the `CALL` clause with `IN TRANSACTIONS`.

In the next lesson, you will learn the importance of splitting your import into multiple steps and how to avoid the Eager problem.
