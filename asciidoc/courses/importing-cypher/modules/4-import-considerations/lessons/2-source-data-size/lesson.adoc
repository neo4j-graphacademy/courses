The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import/[`neo4j-admin import` command line interface^] supports importing large data sets. `neo4j-admin import` converts CSV files into the internal binary format of Neo4j and can import millions of rows within minutes.
