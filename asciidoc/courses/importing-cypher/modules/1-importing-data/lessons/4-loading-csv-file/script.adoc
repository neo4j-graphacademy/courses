You are going to learn how to use the LOAD CSV Cypher clause.

// show this syntax - start
// LOAD CSV [WITH HEADERS] FROM url [AS alias] [FIELDTERMINATOR char]

`LOAD CSV` Cypher reads data from a CSV file and returns the rows. 

You can specify whether the file has a header row, the file location and the field terminator

// end

I am going to show you how to use LOAD CSV to load a CSV file from a URL.

// show this file - start

// https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/people.csv

// personId,name,birthYear
// 23945,Gerard Pires,1942
// 553509,Helen Reddy,1941
// 113934,Susan Flannery,1939

The file contains data about people and their year of birth.

Note how the first row contains the header names and that a comma is used as the field terminator.

// end

// run this in a sandbox - start

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS 
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/people.csv'
as row
RETURN row

See how the header names match those in the CSV file.

I didn't need to specify a `FIELDTERMINATOR` clause because the default value is a comma.

// end 

Now the data has been loaded into Neo4j, you can use it to create nodes and relatioships.
