== LOAD CSV

The `LOAD CSV` Cypher clause reads data from a CSV file and returns the rows in the file. 

`LOAD CSV` has the following syntax:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
LOAD CSV [WITH HEADERS] FROM url [AS alias] [FIELDTERMINATOR char]
----

You can specify whether the file has a header row, the file location and the field terminator

You are going to load a link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/people.csv[CSV file that contains people data^]:

[source,csv]
----
personId,name,birthYear
23945,Gerard Pires,1942
553509,Helen Reddy,1941
113934,Susan Flannery,1939
----

In the Sandbox run the following Cypher statement to load the `people.csv` file:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS 
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/people.csv'
as row
RETURN row
----

Review the data returned. Note the number of rows returned and the header names match those in the CSV file.

[source, json]
----
{
  "birthYear": "1942",
  "name": "Gerard Pires",
  "personId": "23945"
}
----

The `FIELDTERMINATOR` wasn't specified in the `LOAD CSV` clause because the default value is a comma. If the field terminator was a pipe character, the `LOAD CSV` clause would need to include the field terminator:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS 
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/people.csv' 
as row FIELDTERMINATOR '|'
RETURN row
----

== Counting rows

A simple check you can do to ensure all rows are loaded is to count the number of rows in the CSV file and compare it to the number of rows returned by the `LOAD CSV` clause.

You can return the number of rows in the CSV file using the `COUNT` function.

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS 
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/people.csv' 
as row
RETURN count(row)
----

== Accessing files

`LOAD CSV` can access files on a Neo4j server's file system or a remote machine.

The Sandbox in this course and link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/[Aura DB] cloud service only allow access to remote files.

You can find more information in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/data-import/csv-import/#_reading_csv_files[Reading CSV Files] section of the Neo4j documentation.
