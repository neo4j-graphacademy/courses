When you import data into Neo4j, you typically start with a set of source files

You may have exported this source data from a relational database, a Web API or maybe a spreadsheet.

The data may not be in the format you need, 

there may be more data than you need, 

and it may not be structured in a way that maps to your data model.

As such, its likely, you will need to transform the data before or during the import.

Before you import data into Neo4j, there is no graph data structure, only an empty database - as you import data, you create the graph data model.

You will need to create Cypher code to:

// Slide of these steps

* Read the source data.
* Transform the data as needed.
* Create nodes, relationships, and properties to create the graph.

Creating an import process will likely require multiple iterations as you build, test, and refactor.
