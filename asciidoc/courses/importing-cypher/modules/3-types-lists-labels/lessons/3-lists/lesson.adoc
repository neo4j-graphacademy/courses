In this lesson, you will learn about:

* Multi-value properties and lists
* How to transform a string value into a list
* The `split` function

== What is a Multi-value property?

A multi-value property is a property that can hold one or more values. Neo4j represents this type of data as a list (or `"StringArray"`).

All values in a list must have the same data type. For example:

* `["Apple", "Banana, "Orange"]`
* `[100, 55, 4]`

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/movies.csv[`movies.csv`^] data file contains multi-value properties, including:

* `countries` - the countries which produced the movie
* `languages` - the languages spoken in the movie

Find the `countries` and `languages` data in the `movies.csv` file. You will see that each property contains a list of values separated by a `|` character. For example:

[source]
----
USA|France|Italy|Germany
English|Mandarin|Russian
----

== Split the data into a list

The `split` function will transform a string value into a list. The `split` function takes two arguments:

* The string to split
* The character to split on

This updated `Movie` import creates a list of `countries` by using the `split` function:

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing-cypher/movies.csv'
AS row
MERGE (m:Movie {movieId: toInteger(row.movieId)})
SET
m.tmdbId = toInteger(row.tmdbId),
m.imdbId = toInteger(row.imdbId),
m.released = date(row.released),
m.title = row.title,
m.year = toInteger(row.year),
m.plot = row.plot,
m.budget = toInteger(row.budget),
m.imdbRating = toFloat(row.imdbRating),
m.poster = row.poster,
m.runtime = toInteger(row.runtime),
m.imdbVotes = toInteger(row.imdbVotes),
m.revenue = toInteger(row.revenue),
m.url = row.url,
m.countries = split(row.countries, '|')
----

The statement sets the `countries` property as a list by splitting the data from the CSV file by the `|` character.

Run the query and inspect the `countries` property data by writing a `MATCH` query to return the data. 

[TIP]
====
You can query data in a list using the `IN` operator. For example, finding all the movies where "French" is a listed language.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) 
WHERE "France" IN m.countries
RETURN m

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about multi-value properties, lists and how to create them using the `split` function.

In the next lesson, you will update the Cypher statement to split the `languages` property into a list.
