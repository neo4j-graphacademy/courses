== Add Labels to Existing Nodes

Adding labels to existing nodes can make your graph more useful and performant.

The `Person` nodes in the graph represent both actors and directors. To determine if a person is an actor or director, you need to query the `ACTED_IN` or `DIRECTED` relationships. Alternatively, you could add labels to the existing nodes to distinguish between actors and directors.

You can add labels to a node using `SET`, the syntax is:

[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (n)
SET n:Label
----

The following query would add the `Actor` label to all `Person` nodes that have acted in a movie:

[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->()
SET p:Actor
----

The query: 

. Finds all the `Person` nodes with an `ACTED_IN` relationship to a node
. Sets the `Actor` label to those nodes

As there are people in the database who have acted in more than one movie, you can use `WITH DISTINCT` to ensure that each person is only labeled once. Although not essential, this will improve the performance of the statement.

[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->()
WITH DISTINCT p SET p:Actor
----

== Add Actor label

Run the query to add the `Actor` label:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->()
WITH DISTINCT p SET p:Actor
----

You can confirm it was successful by using the `Actor` label to find actors in the graph:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor) RETURN a LIMIT 25
----

[NOTE]
.Filtering by labels is faster
By adding the `Actor` label to the graph, queries that use the label rather than the relationship will be quicker to return.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to add labels to existing nodes.

Next, you will create a Cypher statement to add a `Director` label to nodes with a `DIRECTED` relationship.
