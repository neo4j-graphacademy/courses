You can either run a query to retrieve all nodes in the graph and count the number of nodes in the visualization by running the following query:

.Get All Nodes

MATCH (n) RETURN n
----

**Warning:** Don't run this on a large dataset as it may crash your Browser window.

Alternatively, you could run the following query to get a count of `:Person` nodes in the graph:

.Get Node Count by Label

MATCH (:Person) RETURN count(*)
