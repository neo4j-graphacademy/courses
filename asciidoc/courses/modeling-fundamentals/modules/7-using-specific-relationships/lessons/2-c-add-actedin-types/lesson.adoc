In this Challenge, you will modify the instance model to match the following diagram.
This diagram uses specialized ACTED_IN and DIRECTED relationships.

This Challenge has 2 steps:

1. <<Refactor all ACTED_IN relationships>>
2. <<Refactor all DIRECTED relationships>>


== Refactor all ACTED_IN relationships

Execute the following code to create a new set of relationships based on the year of the `released` property for each Node.

For example, _Apollo 13_ was released in 1995, so an additional `ACTED_IN_1995` will be created between Apollo 13 and any actor that acted in the movie.

.Creating Specialized Relationships
[source,cypher]
----
include::solution.cypher[tag="actedin"]
----

It should create 5 relationships.

With this refactoring, we can now confirm that our rewritten query works for the use case:

**Use case #12: What movies did an actor act in for a particular year?**

To verify the query has run successfully, we can attempt to use the newly created `ACTED_IN_1995` relationship to see which Movies Tom Hanks acted in that were released in 1995.

.Tom Hanks Movies released in 1995
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN_1995]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN m.title AS Movie
----

It should return one movie from our dataset, **Apollo 13**.

== Refactor all DIRECTED relationships

We can use the same method to create `DIRECTED_{year}` relationships between the Director and the Movie.

Modify the code you have just run to match the following pattern.

`MATCH (n:Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)`

Then modify the procedure call change the prefix of the relationship to `DIRECTED_`.

It should create 2 relationships.


== Testing the Model

With this refactoring and the previous refactoring, we can now confirm that our rewritten query works for the use case:

**Use case #12: What movies did an actor act in for a particular year?**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN_1995|DIRECTED_1995]->()
RETURN p.name as `Actor or Director`
----

It should return Tom Hanks and Martin Scorsese.

== Summary

In this Challenge, you demonstrated that you can refactor the graph to specialize  the ACTED_IN and DIRECTED relationships.

In the next Challenge, you will refactor the _RATED_ relationship.
