In the previous Challenge, you added a number of specialized relationships to the graph for the _ACTED_IN_ and _DIRECTED_ relationships.
This Challenge has 3 steps.

In our current graph, there are _RATED_ relationships between _User_ nodes and _Movie_ nodes.

Suppose we wanted to improve the performance of this query:

**Use case #9: What users gave a movie a rating of 5?**

== Why create specialized relationships?

Let's take a practical example.
Run this Cypher code to test this use case with the movie, Apollo 13.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Apollo 13' AND
r.rating = 5
RETURN u.name as Reviewer
----

It should return one User, _Sandy Jones_.

What if there were thousands of Users in the graph. This query would need to traverse all _RATED_ relationships and evaluate the _rating_ property.
For a large graph, more evaluations mean longer query processing time.

In this challenge, you will specialize the _RATED_ relationships to reflect the rating.
Unlike the refactoring where we removed the _genres_ and _languages_ properties from the nodes, we will not remove the _rating_ property from the _RATED_ relationship.
This is because we may need it for a query that has a reference to the relationship and needs to return the _rating_ value.

This is the instance model you will refactor toward:

== Creating specialized RATED_{rating} Relationships

To pass this challenge, you must use the knowledge you gained in the previous lesson to merge a relationship between the graph using `apoc.merge.relationship`.

Update the Cypher code you previously used to create specialized _RATED_{rating} relationships.

[source,cypher, role=noplay]
----
include::sandbox.cypher[]
----

The pattern to search for is:

> `MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)`

The relationship type passed as the second parameter should be:

> 'RATED_'+ r.rating

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can refactor the graph to specialize the _RATED_ relationships.

In the next module, you will learn about creating intermediate nodes.
