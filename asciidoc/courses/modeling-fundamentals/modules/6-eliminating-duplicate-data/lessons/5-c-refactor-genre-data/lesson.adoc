In the previous Challenge, you eliminated duplication by taking the data in the _languages_ property and creating _Language_ nodes that are related to movies.

This challenge has three steps:

. Modify and run the query in the sandbox query pane to use the data in the _genres_ property for the _Movie_ nodes and create _Genre_ nodes using the _IN_GENRE_ relationship to connect _Movie_ nodes to _Genre_ nodes.
. Delete the _genres_ property from the _Movie_ nodes.
. Rewrite the query for the use case:  *What drama movies did an actor act in?*

Copy this query to the sandbox query pane, rewrite it, and test this Cypher query to test this use case with the person, Tom Hanks.

[source,cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks' AND
'Drama' IN m.genres
RETURN m.title AS Movie
----

It should return the movies Apollo 13 and Sleepless in Seattle.

== Execute The Query

Use the Sandbox window to `UNWIND` the `genres` property of each Movie, then create a new node and relationship.

Once you have done so, click **Check Database** to verify that the graph has been correctly refactored.

// [TIP]
// .Your Query
// --
// The first query should create 6 nodes and 10 relationships.

// The second query should update 4 nodes (use SET m.genres=null to remove the property).

// For the third query, you must use the pattern `(p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]-(g:Genre)` and test the _name_ property of the _Genre_ node.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can refactor the graph to add nodes to replace duplication in properties.

Your instance model should now look like this:

In the next lesson, you will learn some more refactoring tips to eliminate duplicate data that is complex.
