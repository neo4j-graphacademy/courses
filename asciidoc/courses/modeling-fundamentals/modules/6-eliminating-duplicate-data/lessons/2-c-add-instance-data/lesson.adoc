= Adding Language Data

In the previous lesson, you learned that duplicating data in the graph can be expensive.

To illustrate duplication of data, you will add a languages property to each _Movie_ node in the instance model, before refactoring to eliminate the duplication.

Execute this Cypher code to add a _languages_ property to the _Movie_ nodes of the graph:

.Adding a Language Property
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (apollo:Movie {title: 'Apollo 13'})
MATCH (sleep:Movie {title: 'Sleepless in Seattle'})
MATCH (hoffa:Movie {title: 'Hoffa'})
MATCH (casino:Movie {title: 'Casino'})
SET apollo.languages = ['English']
SET sleep.languages =  ['English']
SET hoffa.languages =  ['English', 'Italian', 'Latin']
SET casino.languages =  ['English']
----

And here is the associated instance model:

==  Querying languages

Here is a query to support our new use case:

*Use case #11: What movies are available in a particular language?*

With this query, we find all movies in _Italian_.

Execute this query and answer the next question.

.Movies in Italian
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE 'Italian' IN m.languages
RETURN m.title
----

== Summary

In this challenge, you added a _languages_ property to each _Movie_ node to support the new use case.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to refactor duplicate data.
