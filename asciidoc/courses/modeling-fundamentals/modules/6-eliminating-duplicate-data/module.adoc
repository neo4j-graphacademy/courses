= Eliminating Duplicate Data
:order: 6


== Module Overview

In this module, you will learn how to identify and eliminate duplicate data in your graph model. By converting repeated property values into dedicated nodes, you can improve query performance, reduce storage overhead, and make your model more maintainable.

You will learn about:

* Creating nodes from properties where property values are duplicated in the graph.
* Eliminating complex data in nodes that is expensive to query and maintain.
* Refactoring techniques to normalize your graph data effectively.
