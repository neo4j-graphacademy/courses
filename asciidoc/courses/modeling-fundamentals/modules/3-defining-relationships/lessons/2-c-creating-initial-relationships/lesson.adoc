Each _ACTED_IN_ relationship here has a different value for the _role_ property.

Run this Cypher code to add the _ACTED_IN_ and _DIRECTED_ relationships to the graph:

[TIP]
Click the *Run in Sandbox* button to the top right of the code sample to open the Sandbox to the right create the nodes and relationships.

You can verify that the relationships have been created with this code:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[a:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) 
RETURN p, a, m
----

There should be a total of 6 relationships in the graph.
