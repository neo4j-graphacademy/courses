= 1. Adding a new relationship to the model

What Relationship Type could you use when creating a relationship between _User_ nodes and _Movie_ to represent a rating?

* [ ] rated
* [x] RATED
* [ ] SCORE
* [ ] RATING

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
A common way of talking about movie ratings is that a user has *rated* a movie.
Once the data is created, rating the movie is in the past, so using *past tense* makes sense.

You format relationship types as `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The answer here is **RATED**.

`rated` is in the wrong case and `SCORE` and `RATING` are nouns rather than verbs.
