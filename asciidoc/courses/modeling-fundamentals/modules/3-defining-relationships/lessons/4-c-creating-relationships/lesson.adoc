We want to add some relationships between _User_ nodes and _Movie_ nodes so we can test our model.

In this challenge, you will create _RATED_ relationships that include the _rating_ property.

This Cypher creates one relationship between Sandy Jones and Apollo 13 with a rating of 5.

Add additional `MERGE` clauses to create the remaining 4 relationships as per the table below:

*Note*: The first relationship is already created for you.

[TIP]
--
Use `MATCH` to find the _User_ and _Movie_ nodes, then use `MERGE` to create the relationships between the two nodes.

Remember that you must specify or infer(left-to-right) a direction when you create a relationship.

You should create a total of 5 _RATED_ relationships in the graph, each with a property, _rating_.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can create some relationships to support your instance model.

Your instance model should now look like this:

In the next module, you will learn why and how to refactor your data model.
