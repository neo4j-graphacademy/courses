We want to add a couple of _User_ nodes to the graph so we can test the changes to our model.

Any _User_ node will have the following properties:

* userId - an integer (eg. `123`)
* name - a string (eg. `User's Name`)

Replace the `???` in this `MERGE` query to create two _User_ nodes with the following properties:

. `userId` = [copy]#534#, `name` = [copy]#Sandy Jones#, 
. `userId` = [copy]#105#, `name` = [copy]#Clinton Spencer#,

[IMPORTANT]
.Case sensitivity
The property names and values are case-sensitive. 
Make sure you use the correct case when entering the property names and values.

Run the query to create 2 `User` nodes.

You can run the following query to check the nodes have been created:

MATCH (u:User) 
RETURN u.userId, u.name

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can create some nodes to support your instance model.

Your instance model should now look like this:

In the next module, you will learn how to add relationships to your model.
