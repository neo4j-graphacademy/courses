= Creating More Nodes
:type: challenge

We want to add a couple of _User_ nodes to the graph so we can test the changes to our model.

Any _User_ node will have the following properties:

* userId - an integer (eg. `123`)
* name - a string (eg. `User's Name`)

Use the sandbox window to the right to create two User nodes for:

. [copy]#'Sandy Jones'# with the [copy]#userId# of [copy]#534#
. [copy]#'Clinton Spencer'# with the [copy]#userId# of [copy]#105#


[TIP]
--
Modify the `MERGE` statement in the Sandbox window to find or create the two users in the database.

You can either create the two nodes in one query, or create the nodes in two separate queries.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can create some nodes to support your instance model.

Your instance model should now look like this:

In the next module, you will learn how to add relationships to your model.
