= Adding a new label to the model

What **label** should be added to nodes to identify any **Users** who have rated a movie?

* [ ] user
* [x] User
* [ ] Users
* [ ] Person

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Use a label that represents a _user_ in the database. 

There are already labels for _Movie_ and _Person_. 
Use a label that differentiates a rating website *user* who rated movies from a *person* who acted in or directed movies.

You format labels as `CamelCase` with the label starting with a capital letter.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The answer is **User**.

`user` is in the wrong case. `Users` is plural. `Person` is already used for actors and directors.
