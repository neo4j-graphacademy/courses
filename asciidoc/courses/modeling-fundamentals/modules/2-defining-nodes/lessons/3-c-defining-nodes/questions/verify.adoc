input::answer[]

* [x] User


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
We are looking for a string which defines a single label that can be used to look up any node representing a **User** in our database.

We already have defined the labels _Movie_ and _Person_. We want to differentiate a rating website *user* who rated movies from a *person* who acted in or directed movies.

Note also that in this course we will use CamelCase as a standard for our label names. That is, the label will begin with a capital letter.
