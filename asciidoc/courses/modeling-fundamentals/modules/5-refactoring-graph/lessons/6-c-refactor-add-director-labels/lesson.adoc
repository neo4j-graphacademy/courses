In a previous Challenge, you added the `Actor` label to the nodes in the graph.

Modify the query to add a `DIRECTOR` label the `Person` nodes that have the outgoing `DIRECTED` relationship.

[source,cypher]
----
include::sandbox.cypher[]
----

[TIP]
--
Your code should add 2 labels to the graph.
--

After refactoring the graph, you must test any use cases that are affected.

== Use case #2: What person directed a movie?

Modify this query to use the _Director_ label, then test this use case using the movie, Hoffa.

[source,cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]-(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Hoffa'
RETURN  p.name AS Director
----

It should return Danny DeVito.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can refactor the graph to add a `DIRECTOR` label to some of its nodes and retest relevant use cases.

Your instance model should now look like this:

In the next lesson, you will learn some tips about what not to do with labels in your graph data model.
