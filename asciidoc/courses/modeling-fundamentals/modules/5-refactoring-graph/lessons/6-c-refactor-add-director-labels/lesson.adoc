= Adding the Director Label
:type: challenge
:order: 6
:sandbox: true

In a previous Challenge, you added the _Actor_ label to the nodes in the graph.

Modify the query in the sandbox query pane to label the _Person_ nodes that have the outgoing relationship of _DIRECTED_ to be labeled _Director_.

[TIP]
--
The new label will be _Director_. Your code should add 2 labels to the graph.
--

After refactoring the graph, you must test any use cases that are affected.

== 2. What person directed a movie?

Copy this query into the query pane, and modify it to use the _Director_ label, then test this use case using the movie, Hoffa.

[source,cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]-(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Hoffa'
RETURN  p.name AS Director
----

It should return Danny DeVito.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can refactor the graph to add a _DIRECTOR_ label to some of its nodes and retest relevant use cases.

Your instance model should now look like this:

In the next lesson, you will learn some tips about what not to do with labels in your graph data model.
