You have refactored the graph to add the _Actor_ label to the appropriate nodes.
You must now retest your use cases against the refactored graph.

Note that if you had a fully-scaled graph, you would see differences in the queries that use the _Person_ label vs. the _Actor_ label.
You can profile the queries to compare the rows retrieved before an after.

== Use case #1: What people acted in a movie?

Run this Cypher code to test this use case using the movie, Sleepless in Seattle.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Sleepless in Seattle'
RETURN p.name AS Actor
----

It should return two names of actors, Tom Hanks, and Meg Ryan.

== Use case #3: What movies did a person act in?

Run this Cypher code to test this use case using the person, Tom Hanks.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN m.title AS Movie
----

It should return the movies Apollo 13 and Sleepless in Seattle.

== Use case #5: Who was the youngest person to act in a movie?

Run this Cypher code to test this use case with the movie, Hoffa.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Hoffa'
RETURN  p.name AS Actor, p.born as `Year Born` ORDER BY p.born DESC LIMIT 1
----

It should return Danny DeVito with his birth year.

== Use case #6: What role did a person play in a movie?

Run this Cypher code to test this use case with the movie, Sleepless in Seattle and the person, Meg Ryan.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Actor)-[r:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Sleepless in Seattle' AND
p.name = 'Meg Ryan'
RETURN  r.role AS Role
----

It should return Annie Reed.

== Use case #8: What drama movies did an actor act in?

Run this Cypher code to test this use case with the person, Tom Hanks.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks' AND
'Drama' IN m.genres
RETURN m.title AS Movie
----

If you were to change 'Drama' to 'Comedy' in this query, it would return a different result.

== Use case #10: What actors were born before 1950?

Run this Cypher code to test this use case with the year 1950.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Actor)
WHERE p.born < '1950'
RETURN p.name
----

It should return the actors, Danny DeVito and Jack Nicholson

When you have tested all the use cases, continue to next lesson.

== Summary

In this challenge, you tested the use cases affected by the refactoring to add the _Actor_ label.

In the next Challenge, you will add the _Director_ label to the graph.
