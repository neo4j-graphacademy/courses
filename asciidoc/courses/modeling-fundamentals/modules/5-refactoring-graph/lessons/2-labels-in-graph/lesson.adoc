== Labels at runtime

Node labels serve as an anchor point for a query.
By specifying a label, we are specifying a subset of one or more nodes with which to start a query.
Using a label helps to reduce the amount of data that is retrieved.

For example:

`MATCH (n) RETURN n` returns all nodes in the graph.

`MATCH (n:Person) RETURN n` returns all _Person_ nodes in the graph.

Your goal in modeling should be to reduce the size of the graph that is touched by a query.

In Cypher, you can produce a query plan that shows what operations occur during the query.
This figure shows a query plan by the number of db hits for the query to retrieve all _Person_ nodes:

Later in this lesson you will learn how to produce a query plan.

If _Person_ nodes also had a label which is the country that a person is from, then you could used this Cypher code to retrieve all people from the US:

`MATCH (n:US) RETURN n` returns all _US_ nodes in the graph which happen to be _Person_ nodes.

But having a label that is specific like this might be overkill, especially if the query could be:

`MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.country = 'US' RETURN n`

In Cypher, you cannot parameterize labels so keeping the country as a property makes the Cypher code more flexible.

But if you have a strong use case for having multiple labels for a node, you should do so.

=== Do not overuse labels

You should use labels wisely in your data model.
They should be used if it will help with *most* of your use cases.
A best practice is to limit the number of labels for a node to 4.

Here is an example of overuse of labels in the data model:

image::images/label-overuse.png[Label overuse,width=400,align=center]

Here we see _Person_ nodes that have a label representing the country that a Person is from like we described earlier.

In addition, we see multiple labels for _Movie_ nodes.
The label represents the languages available for a movie.

This is another similar scenario where you must decide if an important use case is related to the language of a movie.
Again if the use of a property for a node will suffice, then it is best to not have the label.

===  New use case

Here is an example where adding a label will help our queries at runtime.

What if we added a new use case:

*Use case #10: What actors were born before 1950?*

Here is the Cypher statement to test this use case:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-()
WHERE p.born < '1950'
RETURN p.name
----

Here is what this Cypher statement does:

. A node by label scan to retrieve all _Person_ nodes.
. Tests the born property for the nodes retrieved to filter them.
. Determines which of these filtered nodes have the outgoing _ACTED_IN_ relationship.
. Returns the name property values.

=== Profiling a query

You can use the `PROFILE` keyword to see the performance for a query.

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-()
WHERE p.born < '1950'
RETURN p.name
----

This is the result of the profile:

Because the cache is automatically populated, it is sometimes hard to measure performance with a small dataset.
That is, db hits and elapsed time may not be comparable.
What you can see, however, is the number of rows that are retrieved in the query and this number can be compared.

In the first step of this query, we see that 5 rows are returned.
You can imagine that if this were a fully-loaded graph with millions of nodes, in step 1, it would need to retrieve a lot of _Person_ nodes, some of which are not actors.
One way that you can optimize this retrieval is to change the data model to include an Actor label for a Person node.

=== Refactoring the model

If we refactor, the initial node by label scan would only retrieve the Actor nodes.

Here is the refactored instance model we will create in the graph:

image::images/added-actor-label-instance.png[Added Actor label,width=400,align=center]


=== Refactor the graph

With Cypher, you can easily transform the graph.
With this code, that you will execute in the next Challenge, we find all _Person_ nodes that have an _ACTED_IN_ relationship.
We then set a label for the node.


[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE exists ((p)-[:ACTED_IN]-())
SET p:Actor
----

In the next Challenge, you will refactor the graph to add the _Actor_ label.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned why adding labels can benefit the use cases and how to measure the benefit using `PROFILE`.
In the next challenge, you refactor the graph to add the _Actor_ label.
