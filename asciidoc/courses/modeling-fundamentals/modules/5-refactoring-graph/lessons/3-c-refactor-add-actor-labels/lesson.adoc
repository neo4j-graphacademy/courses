Here is the refactored instance model we will create in the graph where we add an _Actor_ label to some of the _Person_ nodes:

image::images/added-actor-label-instance.png[Added Actor label,width=400,align=center]

== Profile the query

Execute this query:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-()
WHERE p.born < '1950'
RETURN p.name
----

In the first step of this query, we see that 5 Person rows are returned.

== Refactor the graph

With Cypher, you can easily transform the graph to add Actor labels.

Execute this Cypher code to add the _Actor_ label to the appropriate nodes:

.Add Actor Labels
[source,cypher]
----
include::solution.cypher[]
----

There are 5 _Person_ nodes in the graph, but only 4 have an `:ACTED_IN` relationship.
Therefore, the query above should apply the _Actor_ label to four of the five _Person_ nodes.

== Profile the query

Now that we have refactored the graph, we must change our query and profile again.

Execute this query:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-()
WHERE p.born < '1950'
RETURN p.name
----

In the first step of this query, we see that 4 Actor rows are returned.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can refactor the graph to add the _Actor_ label to some of its nodes and profile queries before and after the refactoring.

In the next lesson, you will learn that you must retest your use cases after you refactor.
