== Why refactor?

Refactoring is the process of changing the data model *and* the graph.

There are three reasons why you would refactor:

* The graph as modeled does not answer all of the use cases.
* A new use case has come up that you must account for in your data model.
* The Cypher for the use cases does not perform optimally, especially when the graph scales

=== Steps for refactoring

To refactor a graph data model and a graph, you must:

. Design the new data model.
. Write Cypher code to transform the existing graph to implement the new data model.
. Retest all use cases, possibly with updated Cypher code.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned why you refactor a graph and the steps for refactoring.
In the next lesson, you will learn labels are important in the graph data model and how you can refactor a graph to add labels.
