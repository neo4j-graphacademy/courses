= Developing courses with AI
:type: lesson
:order: 5

You have learned how to create courses, modules, lessons, and questions. GraphAcademy provides AI tools and resources to accelerate course development and ensure quality.

In this lesson, you will learn how to use Cursor rules and the Neo4j Documentation MCP server to develop courses more efficiently with AI assistance.


== Cursor rules for course development

The `.cursor/` directory contains rules and templates that guide AI assistants in creating and reviewing GraphAcademy content.


=== Content creation rules

**Writing lessons:**

* `@.cursor/write-theory-lesson.mdc` - Create or improve theory lessons
* `@.cursor/write-challenge-lesson.mdc` - Create hands-on challenge lessons
* `@.cursor/write-lesson-question.mdc` - Create multiple choice questions
* `@.cursor/write-lesson-summary.mdc` - Write lesson summaries


**Course structure:**

* `@.cursor/create-course-llmstxt.mdc` - Generate llms.txt files for courses
* `@.cursor/create-ad-adoc.mdc` - Create ad.adoc files for promotional content


=== Content review rules

**Quality assurance:**

* `@.cursor/review-lesson-content.mdc` - Review lessons for pedagogy, structure, and clarity
* `@.cursor/review-course.mdc` - Review entire course structure and consistency
* `@.cursor/technical-lesson-review.mdc` - Review technical accuracy
* `@.cursor/fact-check-lessons.mdc` - Verify content against Neo4j documentation


**Improvement:**

* `@.cursor/fix-lesson-feedback.mdc` - Address user feedback on lessons
* `@.cursor/lesson-update-instructions.md` - Guidelines for updating existing lessons


=== Style and formatting rules

**In `.cursor/rules/`:**

* `@.cursor/rules/asciidoc-syntax.mdc` - Ensure correct AsciiDoc formatting
* `@.cursor/rules/neo4j-cypher.mdc` - Validate Cypher syntax and best practices
* `@.cursor/rules/slides-formatting.mdc` - Format slide content correctly


=== Using Cursor rules

To use a Cursor rule:

1. Tag the rule in your message: `@.cursor/write-theory-lesson.mdc`
2. Provide context about what you need
3. Tag relevant files or folders: `@lesson-folder/`


Example:

[source]
----
@.cursor/write-theory-lesson.mdc create a lesson about graph data modeling
that covers nodes, relationships, and properties for beginners
----


== Neo4j Documentation MCP server

The Neo4j Documentation MCP server provides AI assistants with access to official Neo4j documentation to ensure accuracy.


=== What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that connects AI applications with tools and data sources.

MCP enables AI agents to:

* Access external resources during reasoning
* Read documentation and data sources
* Execute tools and functions
* Provide accurate, up-to-date information


=== Available MCP tools

The Neo4j Documentation MCP server provides these tools:


**`mcp_neo4j-docs_read_page`**

Reads a specific documentation page.

Use to verify information like:

* Feature availability and syntax
* Configuration options
* API references
* Best practices


**`mcp_neo4j-docs_list_manual_pages`**

Lists all pages in a specific manual.

Available manuals include:

* `aura` - Neo4j Aura documentation
* `operations-manual` - Self-managed Neo4j operations
* `cypher-manual` - Cypher query language reference
* `graph-data-science` - GDS library documentation
* `graphql` - Neo4j GraphQL documentation


**`mcp_neo4j-docs_read_course`**

Reads GraphAcademy course content to check consistency and reuse examples.


=== Using the MCP server

The MCP server works automatically when you use Cursor rules that reference it.

The `@.cursor/rules/fact-check-lessons.mdc` rule uses the MCP server to:

1. Identify claims and technical details in lesson content
2. Query official documentation to verify accuracy
3. Categorize findings as accurate, needs clarification, unverified, or incorrect
4. Suggest specific edits to improve accuracy


Example usage:

[source]
----
@.cursor/rules/fact-check-lessons.mdc verify the technical accuracy of
@lesson-folder/ against Neo4j documentation
----


=== Fact-checking workflow

When fact-checking lessons:

1. **Read the lesson** - AI identifies key claims, metrics, and features
2. **Query documentation** - MCP tools retrieve relevant documentation pages
3. **Verify claims** - Compare lesson content against official docs
4. **Categorize findings**:
   - ✅ **Accurate** - Confirmed by documentation
   - ⚠️ **Needs clarification** - Correct but could be more precise
   - ❓ **Unverified** - Not in docs (may be best practices)
   - ❌ **Incorrect** - Contradicts documentation
5. **Apply fixes** - Update lesson content with accurate information


=== Handling best practices

When lesson content includes recommendations not in official documentation:

* Frame as **general guidelines**, not absolute rules
* Use language like "as a general guideline" or "for example"
* Make clear these are starting points that vary by use case
* Avoid stating unverified thresholds as facts


Example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
As a general guideline, failed queries should be very low, typically
less than 1% of total queries. These thresholds will vary depending on
your specific application requirements.
----


== Neo4j MCP tools for development

While developing courses, you may also use the Neo4j Cypher MCP server to:

* **Query databases** - Get real examples from Neo4j databases
* **Validate Cypher** - Ensure Cypher queries are syntactically correct
* **Explore schemas** - Understand database structures for examples


**Available tools:**

* `mcp_local-neo4j-mcp_get-schema` - Get database schema information
* `mcp_local-neo4j-mcp_read-cypher` - Execute read-only Cypher queries
* `mcp_local-neo4j-mcp_write-cypher` - Execute write queries (with approval)


These tools help create accurate examples based on real database structures.


== Best practices

* **Use rules proactively** - Don't wait until content is finished
* **Fact-check early** - Verify technical accuracy as you write
* **Iterate with AI** - Use multiple rules in sequence for best results
* **Review AI suggestions** - AI helps but you make final decisions
* **Update rules** - Suggest improvements to rules based on your experience
* **Combine approaches** - Use both creation and review rules together


=== Recommended workflow

1. **Start with creation rule** - Generate initial lesson content
2. **Review for structure** - Use `@.cursor/review-lesson-content.mdc`
3. **Fact-check** - Verify with `@.cursor/rules/fact-check-lessons.mdc`
4. **Improve based on feedback** - Iterate on weak areas
5. **Final review** - Check formatting with `@.cursor/rules/asciidoc-syntax.mdc`
