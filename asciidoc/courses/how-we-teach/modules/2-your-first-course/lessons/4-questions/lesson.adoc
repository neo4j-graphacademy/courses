= Questions
:type: lesson
:order: 4

Questions are an important part of the learning process. 
They help to reinforce the material and encourage learners to think critically about what they have learned.

[IMPORTANT]
Questions should be used to help a learner not test them.

A question (or questions) at the end of a lesson is a great way to restate a key point, or to ensure a learner has understood a certain concept.

If we ask a question, we must ensure that the learner has been given the information they need to answer it.

Each question includes a hint and a solution.

The structure of a question is:

[source]
----
[.question]
= Question Title

Introduce the question:

* [ ] Answer 1
* [ ] Answer 2
* [x] Correct Answer 3
* [ ] Answer 4

Single, or multiple answers.

[.question]

=== True or false

Misconceptions are common in learning, and true or false questions can help to identify these.

== Free text

You can use a free text question to ask a learner to enter a specific answer.
Free text questions should be used sparingly, as they can frustrate learners if the answer is not exactly what the author expected.
