= Lessons
:type: lesson
:order: 3

Lessons are the individual sections of a module. 
Each lesson is contained in its own folder, which is numbered and named after the lesson.

Lessons should be focused on a single topic or concept, and should be structured to help the learner understand and apply the material.
Shorter lessons are better than longer ones.

== Structure

Lesson files are named `lesson.adoc` and contain the content for the lesson.

The `lesson.adoc` file must contain: 

* A `:type:` 
* An `:order:`
* A title (`= Heading`) for the lesson
* A `read::` or a question to complete the lesson
* A `[.summary]` section to display when the lesson is completed

== Types

Lessons can have one of the following types:

* `lesson` - a standard lesson
* `challenge` - a lessons that is a challenge or exercise
* `video` - a video lesson
* `quiz` - a quiz lesson

The type should describe the overall content of the lesson. 
For example, if the lesson is primarily a video, it should be marked as `video`. 
If a lesson is a list of questions, it should be marked as `quiz`.
If a lesson is a standard lesson, but it contains a single question, it should be marked as `lesson`.

== Video

Not every lesson needs a video.

Video should be used in lessons when it is helpful to explain a concept, to demonstrate a complicated process, or build learners confidence.
Video lessons should be short, ideally under 5 minutes, and should be used to supplement the course content.

A written version (transcript) of the video should be provided in the lesson content.
