= Course

The course is the main unit of learning in GraphAcademy.
It is a collection of modules and lessons that guide learners through a specific topic or set of skills

Course content is stored in its own folder in the `asciidoc/courses` directory.

Course folders are named using a format of `{category}-{topic}`, for example:

- `cypher-patterns`
- `drivers-python`
- `importing-fundamentals`

== Structure

The `course.adoc` is the main course description and configuration file. 
It contains metadata about the course, such as the title, description, and learning objectives. 
It also includes links to modules and lessons within the course.

The `course.adoc` file must contain the following attributes:

* A `:status:` attribute to indicate the course status (e.g., `draft`, `active`, `disabled`)
* A list of `:categories:` to indicate the course categories
* The `:caption:` attribute to provide a brief description of the course
* The course `:duration:` attribute to indicate how long the course takes to complete
* The 3 `key-points:` for the course.

The following are optional attributes:

* `:video:` - a link to a video introduction to the course
* `:repository:` - GitHub repository for course resources
* `:next:` - the next course in the learning path
* `:usecase:` attribute to indicate what sandbox the course should use, for example, `blank-sandbox`, `recommendations`, or `movie`.

The course content should include the following sections:

* Course title and description
* Pre-requisites - what learners should know and need before taking the course
* What you will learn - the learning objectives for the course
* This course includes - a summary of the course content, such as the number of lessons, videos, challenges, and quizzes

== Learning Objectives

Learning objectives are the key takeaways from the course.
They should be clear, concise, and measurable.

Use a verb that indicates what the learner will be able to do after completing the course, such as "understand", "apply", "analyze", or "create".

The learning objectives should be specific and focused on the skills or knowledge that the learner will gain from the course.
They should not be too broad or vague, and should be achievable within the scope of the course.

For example:

* Understand the basics of graph theory and how it applies to Neo4j
* Apply basic Cypher queries to read and write data in a Neo4j database
* Analyze graph data to identify patterns and relationships
* Create Python applications that interact with Neo4j
