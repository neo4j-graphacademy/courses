= Modules

Numbered folders are used to indicate the order of the modules in the course. 

The first module is `1-introduction`, the second is `2-learn-about-a-thing`, and so on.

== Structure

The `module.adoc` is the module description and configuration file.
It introduces the learner to the module and should provide a brief overview what they are going to learn.

The module should contain: 

* an `:order:` attribute.
* a link to the first lesson in the module.
