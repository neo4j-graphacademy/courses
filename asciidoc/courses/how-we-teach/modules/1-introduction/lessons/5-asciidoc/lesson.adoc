GraphAcademy course content is written in link:https://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc^].

Asciidoc is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write structured documents in a plain text format.

== Attributes

Attributes are used to define variables in Asciidoc. 
They can be used to store values that can be reused throughout the document.

Attributes are also used in GraphAcademy to define metadata for courses, modules, and lessons (`type`, `order`, `repository`, etc).

== Asciidoc Snippets

These are some common Asciidoc snippets.

=== Headings

[source]
----
= Heading 1
== Heading 2
=== Heading 3
==== Heading 4
----

=== Lists

Lists are defined using `*` for unordered lists and `.` for ordered lists:

[source]
----
* Unordered list item 1
* Unordered list item 2
* Unordered list item 2
----

[source]
----
. Ordered list item 1
. Ordered list item 2
. Ordered list item 3
----

=== Code

Code blocks are defined using `----`. You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting:

```
[source,python]
----
print("Hello, World!")
----
```

=== Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are defined using the `link:` syntax:

[source]
----
link:https://neo4j.com[Neo4j Website]
----

=== Images

Images can be included using the `image::` directive:

[source]
----
image::images/my_image.png["A textual description of the image"]
----

=== Includes

You can include other Asciidoc files using the `include::` directive.

`include::path/to/another_file.adoc[]`

Including code from a repository can be done using the `include::` and you can tag specific blocks of code:

`include::{repository}/solutions/my_program.py[tag=mycodeblock]`

=== Admonitions

Admonitions are used to highlight important information. 

They can be used to provide a `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, or `NOTE`.
