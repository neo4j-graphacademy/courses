== Neo4j Editorial Style

Our style builds upon link:https://neo4j.design/40a8cff71/p/970a77-editorial-styleguide[Neo4j's editorial style^]:

* *Voice* - Our voice is consistently confident, approachable, and intentional. 
* *Tone* -  Our tones will vary in application, depending on the context and the communication’s purpose, but will always have some common characteristics. 
+
Our tones are: direct, accessible, playful, and insightful.
* *Don’t Forget to Be Human* - Neo4j is a collection of people who are passionate, smart, helpful, and fun to be around. 
+
The way we talk to people should communicate this. 
* *Confident* - We have a clear, objective view of matters in our domain and are ready with the best course of action. 
+
We firmly stand behind our decisions and proudly talk about how our technology helps our customers succeed. We’re positive and always seek to find a solution.

== GraphAcademy

When writing for GraphAcademy, you will follow the Neo4j editorial style, but with some additional guidelines to enhance the learning experience:

* *Second Person*
+
Speak directly to the learner, using "you" and "your" to create a personal connection. Avoid using "we" or "our" to maintain focus on the learner's experience.
+
_**You** will use Cypher to..._

* *Active voice*
+
Use active voice to make the content more engaging and direct. Passive voice can make sentences longer and less impactful.
* *Concise language*
+
Use short, clear sentences to enhance readability. Avoid complex sentence structures that may confuse the learner.
+
The shortest number of words that can be used to convey the message is usually preferred. This helps maintain clarity and keeps the learner's attention.
* *Avoid selling*
+
The objective of GraphAcademy is to *teach*, not to sell. GraphAcademy learners have already made a choice to learn about Neo4j, we don't need to convince them to do so.
* *Avoid redundancy**
+
Don't use "Now", "So", and "Lets" at the start of sentences. These words can be redundant and do not add value to the content.
