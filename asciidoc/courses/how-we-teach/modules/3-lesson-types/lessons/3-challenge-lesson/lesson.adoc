= Challenge Lessons
:type: lesson
:order: 3

Challenge lessons provide hands-on exercises where learners apply what they've learned.
They typically involve coding, configuration, or problem-solving tasks.


== Configuration

Example from cypher-fundamentals course:

[source,role=nocopy]
----
include::../../../../../cypher-fundamentals/modules/1-reading/lessons/2-c-read-nodes/lesson.adoc[]
----


== Required Attributes

* **:type: challenge** - Identifies this as a challenge lesson
* **:order:** - Numeric order within the module
* **Title** - Level 1 heading describing the challenge


== Common Attributes

* **:lab:** - Link to sandbox or development environment (e.g., `{repository-blob}/{branch}/src/main/java/App.java`)
* **:branch:** - Git branch containing the challenge code (e.g., `01-connect-to-neo4j`)
* **:optional: true** - Makes the challenge optional
* **:sandbox: true** - Provides a Neo4j sandbox instance for the challenge
* **:test-filename:** - Name of the test file to run for verification
* **:test-method:** - Specific test method to verify completion


== Completion

Challenges use `questions::[]` to verify completion.
The question typically checks that the learner has completed the task correctly.


Unlike standard lessons, challenges don't use `read::` directives.


== Open in Codespaces

Challenge lessons typically require a development environment.
Use GitHub Codespaces to provide learners with a pre-configured environment.


**Course Setup:**

In your `course.adoc`, define the repository:

[source]
----
:repository: neo4j-graphacademy/drivers-java
----


This automatically creates attributes:

* `{repository-link}` - Link to the repository
* `{repository-raw}` - Raw file URL
* `{repository-blob}` - Blob file URL


**Setup Lesson:**

Create a setup lesson that includes the Codespaces link:

[source]
----
= Setup
:type: lesson
:order: 1
:branch: main

include::../../../../../../shared/courses/codespace/get-started.adoc[]
----


The shared file creates a button:

[source]
----
link:https://github.com/codespaces/new/{repository}[Open in GitHub Codespace^,role="btn"]
----


**Challenge Lessons:**

Use the `:branch:` attribute to link to specific solution branches:

[source]
----
= Add the Driver
:type: challenge
:branch: 01-connect-to-neo4j

Your challenge is to modify the code...

[source,java]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/main/java/App.java[tag=driver]
----
----


The `{repository-raw}/{branch}` combination links to the solution code on that branch.


**Example from drivers-java course:**

* **Setup lesson** (lesson 0) - Opens Codespaces on `main` branch
* **Challenge lessons** - Reference specific solution branches (`01-connect-to-neo4j`, `02-execute-query`, etc.)
* Each challenge includes code snippets from its solution branch using `include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/...`


== Best Practices

* Provide clear, numbered instructions
* Break complex challenges into smaller steps
* Include examples when introducing new concepts
* Offer hints or links to relevant documentation
* Ensure verification is fair and matches instructions
* Use `:branch:` to reference solution code without spoiling the challenge
* Link to specific files using `:lab: {repository-blob}/{branch}/path/to/file`
* Celebrate success in the summary

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about challenge lessons, which provide hands-on exercises for learners to apply their knowledge.

Challenge lessons require `:type: challenge`, an `:order:`, instructions, and `questions::[]` for verification.

You also learned how to use GitHub Codespaces to provide pre-configured development environments, and how to use the `:branch:` attribute to reference solution code across different branches.
