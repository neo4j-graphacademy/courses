= Quiz Lessons
:type: lesson
:order: 5

Quiz lessons contain multiple-choice questions to assess knowledge retention and reinforce key concepts.


== Configuration

Example from cypher-fundamentals course showing multiple questions in a lesson:

[source,role=nocopy]
----
include::../../../../../cypher-fundamentals/modules/1-reading/lessons/1-intro-cypher/lesson.adoc[lines=1..8;188..202]
----


== Required Attributes

* **:type: quiz** - Identifies this as a quiz lesson
* **:order:** - Numeric order within the module
* **Title** - Level 1 heading for the quiz
* **questions::[]** - Directive to display questions


== Question Files

Quiz lessons display multiple questions defined in the `questions` subdirectory.


Each question file should be numbered (e.g., `1-first-question.adoc`, `2-second-question.adoc`).


Question file structure:

[source]
----
[.question]
= 1. Read data

Which Cypher clause do you use to read data from Neo4j?

* [ ] `FIND`
* [ ] `SELECT`
* [x] `MATCH`
* [ ] `FROM`

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
This Cypher clause is typically used to return data to the client using a RETURN clause.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
You use the `MATCH` clause to define the pattern in the graph that you would like to search for.
====
----


== Question Structure

Each question file includes:

* **[.question]** - Role on the heading to identify this as a question
* **= Question Title** - Level 1 heading with the question title/number
* **Question text** - Paragraph(s) describing what is being asked
* **Answer options** - Multiple choice using `* [ ]` for incorrect, `* [x]` for correct
* **[TIP,role=hint]** with `.Hint` title - Optional hint for the learner
* **[TIP,role=solution]** with `.Solution` title - Explanation shown after answering


== Multiple Correct Answers

Questions can have multiple correct answers by marking multiple options with `[x]`:

[source]
----
[.question]
= Data in Neo4j

Data within Neo4j is stored and organized using which of the following? (Select all that apply)

* [x] Nodes
* [x] Relationships
* [x] Labels
* [x] Properties

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Nodes and relationships are the fundamental elements of a graph database.
Labels categorize nodes, and properties store data within nodes and relationships.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Data within Neo4j is stored and organized using *nodes*, *relationships*, *labels*, and *properties*.
====
----


== Select in Source Questions

For coding challenges, use the `.question.select-in-source` pattern:

[source]
----
[.question.select-in-source]
= Create a new driver instance

Complete the code below to create a new driver instance.

[source,Java,role=nocopy noplay]
----
var driver = GraphDatabase./*select:driver(*/(
    NEO4J_URI,
    AuthTokens.basic(NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD)
);
----

- [ ] `connect`
- [x] `driver`
- [ ] `GraphDatabase`
- [ ] `new_driver`

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
What is the name of the object used to connect a Neo4j instance?
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The method to create a new connection is `GraphDatabase.driver()`.
====
----


The `/*select:driver(*/` marker indicates where the answer should be inserted.


== Quiz Patterns

**Pattern 1: Questions in Lesson**

Include a single question at the end of a content-rich lesson using `questions::[]`.
This verifies understanding immediately after teaching.


**Pattern 2: Separate Quiz Lesson**

Create a dedicated quiz lesson following a standard lesson.
This is useful when:

* You want to maintain flow in the content lesson (auto-completion)
* You have multiple related questions
* Questions build on each other sequentially


Example from the Python Driver course:

* Lesson 1: "Creating a Driver Instance" (standard lesson, auto-completes)
* Lesson 2: "Quiz" (quiz lesson with multiple sequential questions)


This pattern lets learners read without barriers, then explicitly test their understanding.


== Best Practices

* Ask clear, unambiguous questions
* Provide 3-5 answer options
* Make incorrect options plausible
* Include explanations for all answers
* Use hints sparingly
* Build questions sequentially when they relate to each other
* Avoid trick questions
* Test knowledge, not memorization

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about quiz lessons in GraphAcademy.

Quiz lessons require `:type: quiz` and `questions::[]`, with question files in the `questions` subdirectory.
