= Lesson Types Overview
:type: lesson
:order: 1

GraphAcademy supports five different lesson types, each designed for specific learning objectives and content formats.


== Available Lesson Types

* **lesson** - Standard text-based lesson with optional videos and examples
* **challenge** - Hands-on exercises where learners apply what they've learned
* **video** - Video-focused lessons with transcripts
* **quiz** - Multiple-choice questions to assess knowledge
* **conversation** - AI-powered interactive dialogues for exploration and personalization


== Choosing the Right Type

The lesson type should reflect the primary activity or content format:


**Use `lesson` when:**

* Explaining concepts and principles
* Providing step-by-step instructions
* Introducing new topics
* Offering reference material


**Use `challenge` when:**

* Learners need to practice skills
* You want to verify understanding through action
* Building real-world solutions
* Applying concepts to specific scenarios


**Use `video` when:**

* Demonstrating complex processes
* Building learner confidence
* Showing live coding or walkthroughs
* Explaining visual concepts


**Use `quiz` when:**

* Assessing knowledge retention
* Reinforcing key concepts
* Verifying prerequisite knowledge
* Preparing for certifications


**Use `conversation` when:**

* Exploring open-ended scenarios
* Personalizing content to learner's domain
* Practicing decision-making
* Guiding discovery-based learning


== Lesson Completion

Different lesson types have different completion criteria:

* **lesson** (no questions) - Auto-completes when page loads (maintains flow, no barrier)
* **lesson** (with questions) - Requires answering question(s) correctly
* **challenge** - Requires verification via questions
* **video** - Auto-completes (requires clicking `read::`)
* **quiz** - Requires answering all questions correctly
* **conversation** - Auto-completes when opened


**Design Pattern:**

Many courses use a two-lesson pattern:

1. Standard lesson with `read::` (auto-completes, maintains flow)
2. Separate quiz lesson (tests understanding without interrupting content)


This approach balances accessibility with assessment.


== Mixing Types

While each lesson has a primary type, you can combine elements:

* A `lesson` can include one or two questions
* A `video` lesson includes written transcripts
* A `challenge` can include explanatory text
* A `quiz` typically contains multiple questions that can build sequentially


The type you choose determines how the lesson appears in the course navigation and what completion criteria apply.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the five lesson types available in GraphAcademy: lesson, challenge, video, quiz, and conversation.

Each type serves different learning objectives and you can mix elements to create engaging learning experiences.

In the next lessons, you'll learn the specific configuration required for each type.
