= Conversation Lessons
:type: lesson
:order: 6

Conversation lessons provide an interactive, AI-powered experience where learners can have a guided dialogue with an agent to explore concepts, build models, or solve problems.


== Structure

A conversation lesson requires:

* A `lesson.adoc` file with `:type: conversation`
* A `prompt.txt` file containing instructions for the AI agent
* Optional: `[.conversation-options]` list to provide default starting points for users


== The prompt.txt File

The `prompt.txt` file contains instructions that guide the AI agent's behavior during the conversation.


**Purpose:**

* Define the agent's role and expertise
* Specify how the agent should interact with users
* Provide guidelines for question progression and response format
* Set boundaries and best practices


**Best Practices:**

* Use level 2 headings (##) to organize sections
* Keep instructions clear and actionable
* Specify response format expectations (e.g., no nested lists, use collapsible blocks)
* Include examples of good responses
* Define when and how to end conversations
* Optimize for token efficiency while maintaining clarity


**Example lesson from neo4j-fundamentals course:**

**Example prompt.txt structure:**

----
include::../../../../../neo4j-fundamentals/modules/1-graph-thinking/lessons/4-build-data-model/prompt.txt[lines=1..20]
----


== Conversation Options

The `[.conversation-options]` list provides suggested starting points for learners who may not know where to begin.


**Purpose:**

* Lower the barrier to entry
* Provide relevant examples
* Guide users toward common use cases
* Reduce cognitive load


Users can click an option to start the conversation, or type their own custom prompt.


== When to Use Conversation Lessons

Conversation lessons work best for:

* **Open-ended exploration** - Building data models, brainstorming architectures
* **Personalization** - Adapting content to the learner's specific domain or use case
* **Practice** - Applying concepts learned in previous lessons to real scenarios
* **Discovery** - Helping learners understand possibilities and ask better questions


**Avoid conversation lessons when:**

* There's a single correct answer
* You need to verify specific technical knowledge
* The content is purely informational


== Tips for Effective Conversation Lessons

* **Start with context** - Explain what the agent will help them accomplish
* **Provide examples** - Use conversation-options to show possibilities
* **Guide progression** - Structure the prompt to move through stages
* **Show value** - Have the agent highlight insights that would be difficult without the tool
* **End gracefully** - Direct users to the next lesson when they're ready to move on

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about conversation lessons in GraphAcademy.

You now understand how `prompt.txt` guides the AI agent's behavior, and how `[.conversation-options]` provides users with helpful starting points.

Next, you'll see a demonstration of a conversation lesson in action.
