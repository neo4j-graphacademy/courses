= Standard Lessons
:type: lesson
:order: 2

Standard lessons are the most common lesson type in GraphAcademy.
They are text-based and can include code examples, images, videos, and questions.


== Configuration

Example from neo4j-fundamentals course:

[source,role=nocopy]
----
include::../../../../../neo4j-fundamentals/modules/1-graph-thinking/lessons/2-thinking-in-graphs/lesson.adoc[]
----


== Required Attributes

* **:type: lesson** - Identifies this as a standard lesson
* **:order:** - Numeric order within the module (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
* **Title** - Level 1 heading (=) at the top of the file


== Optional Attributes

* **:optional: true** - Makes the lesson optional for course completion
* **:disable-cache: true** - Prevents caching of dynamic content
* **:lab:** - Links to an external lab or sandbox environment


== Completion

Standard lessons require a `read::` directive to mark completion:

[source]
----
read::Complete the lesson[]
----


The text inside the brackets is displayed on the completion button.


**Auto-completion:**

Lessons without questions are automatically marked as completed when the page loads.
This approach maintains flow and removes barriers to progression, but doesn't explicitly test understanding.


**When to use auto-completion:**

* Introductory or overview content
* Reference material
* Context-setting lessons
* When testing would interrupt the learning flow


== Including Questions

Standard lessons can include questions using the `questions::` directive:

[source]
----
questions::[]
----


This will display questions defined in the lesson's `questions` subdirectory.
