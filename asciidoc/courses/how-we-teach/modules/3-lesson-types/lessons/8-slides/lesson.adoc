= Slides
:type: lesson
:order: 8

Slides provide supplementary visual content that learners can view alongside lessons.
They are typically PDF presentations that complement the course material.


== Configuration

To enable slides for a course or lesson, use the `:slides:` attribute.

Example from cypher-fundamentals course:

[source,role=nocopy]
----
include::../../../../../cypher-fundamentals/modules/1-reading/lessons/1-intro-cypher/lesson.adoc[lines=1..8]
----


== Slides File

Place a `slides.pdf` file in your course root directory:

[source]
----
asciidoc/courses/your-course/
  - course.adoc
  - slides.pdf          <- Course slides
  - modules/
----


When `:slides: true` is set, the slides will be available to view during the course or specific lesson.


== Keyboard Shortcuts

GraphAcademy provides keyboard shortcuts for navigating slides:


**Opening Slides:**

* **Cmd+/** (Mac) or **Ctrl+/** (Windows/Linux) - Toggle slides panel


**Navigating Slides:**

* **Prev** button - Previous slide
* **Next** button - Next slide
* Arrow keys can also be used in the slides viewer


**Navigating Lessons:**

* **Cmd+Left Arrow** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Left Arrow** (Windows/Linux) - Previous lesson
* **Cmd+Right Arrow** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Right Arrow** (Windows/Linux) - Next lesson


== When to Use Slides

Slides work well for:

* Visual diagrams and architecture overviews
* Step-by-step visual processes
* Supplementary reference material
* Conference workshop materials
* Complex concepts that benefit from visual explanation


**Avoid slides when:**

* The content is better explained inline with text
* Interactive examples would be more effective
* The slides duplicate lesson content without adding value


== Best Practices

* Keep slides concise and focused
* Use high-quality images and diagrams
* Ensure text is readable at different screen sizes
* Number slides for easy reference
* Align slide content with lesson progression
* Use slides to complement, not replace, lesson content
* Mention specific slide numbers in lesson text when referencing them


**Example:**

[source]
----
As shown in slide 3, the driver creates a connection pool to manage
connections to the Neo4j database.
----


== Creating Slides

Slides should be exported as PDF with:

* Consistent branding and styling
* Clear, readable fonts (minimum 24pt for body text)
* High contrast for accessibility
* Landscape orientation (16:9 or 4:3 ratio)

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about using slides in GraphAcademy courses.

You now understand how to enable slides with `:slides: true`, place the `slides.pdf` file, and use keyboard shortcuts to navigate (Cmd+/ for slides, Cmd+Arrow for lessons).

Slides provide valuable visual support when used to complement lesson content rather than duplicate it.
