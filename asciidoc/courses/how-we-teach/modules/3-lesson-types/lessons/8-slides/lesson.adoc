== Introduction

GraphAcademy supports a slide view for instructor-led training.

In this lesson, you will learn about AsciiDoc slide formatting and PDF slides, when to use each, and how to implement them effectively.


[.slide]
== Slides in GraphAcademy

GraphAcademy supports two types of slides:

* **AsciiDoc slide formatting** - Embedded presentation-style formatting for instructor-led training
* **PDF slides** - Supplementary visual materials that learners can view alongside lessons


[.slide]
== AsciiDoc slide formatting

Slide formatting transforms lesson content into presentation-style slides with a **16:9 aspect ratio** for instructor-led training.


[.slide.discrete]
=== What are slides?

Slides are implemented using AsciiDoc role markers (`[.slide]`) applied to section headers.

Each slide represents a single concept that can be displayed independently during training sessions.

**Important:** Slides are ONLY for theory lessons (`:type: lesson`). Challenge lessons are designed for learners to read independently, so they should NOT have slide formatting.


[.slide.discrete]
=== Basic syntax

Mark a section as a slide:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.slide]
== Section Title

Content goes here. This will be rendered as a single slide.
----


[.slide.discrete]
=== Slide modifiers

Slides support various modifiers that can be chained together:

* **`.discrete`** - Removes the section from the table of contents/navigation
* **`.col-2`** - Creates a two-column layout for content and images
* **`.reverse`** - Image appears above text in linear reading, but stays on right in slide view
* **`.overflow-hidden`** - Hides overflow content


[.slide.discrete]
=== Two-column layouts

For content with images, use `.col-2` to create a two-column layout:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.slide.col-2]
== Section Title

[.col]
====
Text content goes in the first column.
====

[.col]
====
image::images/screenshot.png[Alt text]
====
----


[.slide.discrete]
=== When to use slide formatting

**Text-only sections:**

* Sections containing only text, lists, or code blocks
* Use `[.slide]` without modifiers


**Text + image sections:**

* Medium to large images alongside short to medium text (1-4 paragraphs)
* Use `[.slide.col-2]`


**Context-first images:**

* Images that provide essential context and should appear above text in linear reading
* Use `[.slide.col-2.reverse]`
* Image displays above text in flow, but on the right in 16:9 slide view


**Subsections:**

* Use `[.slide]` for major concepts that deserve navigation visibility
* Use `[.slide.discrete]` for sub-topics that would clutter navigation


[.slide.discrete]
=== Hiding complex content

Use `.transcript-only` to hide content that doesn't work well in slide format:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.slide]
== Data Filters

[.transcript-only]
====
The following filters are available:
====

[cols="2,4,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Filter | Description | Type | Example
| ... complex table ...
|===
----

Complex tables and detailed tip boxes are better discussed verbally during presentations.


[.slide.discrete]
=== Best practices for slide formatting

* One concept per slide
* Consistency throughout the lesson
* Balance content in two-column layouts
* Test readability in 16:9 format
* Use `.discrete` for sub-topics
* Keep slides focused on key concepts


[.slide]
== PDF slides

PDF slides provide supplementary visual content that learners can view alongside lessons.


[.slide.discrete]
=== Configuration

Enable PDF slides with the `:slides:` attribute in the lesson frontmatter:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Lesson Title
:type: lesson
:order: 1
:slides: true
----


[.slide.discrete]
=== Generated slide files

When you run `npm run generate:slides`, a `slides.pdf` file is automatically created in your course root directory:

[source]
----
asciidoc/courses/your-course/
  - course.adoc
  - slides.pdf          <- Generated from slide markup
  - modules/
----

The PDF is generated from your AsciiDoc slide formatting and becomes available when `:slides: true` is set.


[.slide.discrete]
=== Keyboard shortcuts

GraphAcademy provides keyboard shortcuts for navigating PDF slides:

* **Cmd+/** (Mac) or **Ctrl+/** (Windows/Linux) - Toggle slides panel
* **Prev/Next** buttons - Navigate between slides
* **Cmd+Arrow** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Arrow** (Windows/Linux) - Navigate between lessons


[.slide.discrete]
=== When to generate PDF slides

Generate PDF slides when:

* Creating instructor-led training materials
* Learners need downloadable presentation decks
* Content should be available offline
* Providing workshop or conference materials




[.slide.discrete]
=== Building PDF slides

PDF slides are built automatically from your AsciiDoc slide markup:

[source,bash]
----
npm run generate:slides
----

This command:

* Reads lessons with `[.slide]` markup
* Generates 16:9 PDF presentations
* Places `slides.pdf` files in course directories
* Creates downloadable slide decks for learners


The generated PDFs match your slide formatting exactly, providing learners with a downloadable version of the presentation.


[.slide]
== Workflow for creating slides

The typical workflow for creating slides in GraphAcademy:

1. **Write lesson content** - Create your lesson in AsciiDoc
2. **Add slide markup** - Apply `[.slide]` markers to sections
3. **Test locally** - View slides in development environment
4. **Generate PDFs** - Run `npm run generate:slides`
5. **Enable slides** - Set `:slides: true` in lesson frontmatter
6. **Deploy** - PDF becomes available to learners automatically


Both the online slide view and downloadable PDF are generated from the same AsciiDoc markup, ensuring consistency.

[.summary]
== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about two types of slides in GraphAcademy: AsciiDoc slide formatting for instructor-led training and PDF slides for supplementary materials.

AsciiDoc slides use `[.slide]` markers to format content in 16:9 presentation style, while PDF slides provide external visual materials.

You now understand when to use each approach and how to implement them effectively.
