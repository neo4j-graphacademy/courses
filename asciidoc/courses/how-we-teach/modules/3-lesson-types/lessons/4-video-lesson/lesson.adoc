= Video Lessons
:type: lesson
:order: 4

Video lessons are designed for content that benefits from visual demonstration, such as live coding, complex processes, or building learner confidence.


== Configuration

Example from neo4j-fundamentals course:

[source,role=nocopy]
----
include::../../../../../neo4j-fundamentals/modules/1-graph-thinking/lessons/1-what-is-neo4j/lesson.adoc[]
----


== Required Attributes

* **:type: video** - Identifies this as a video lesson
* **:order:** - Numeric order within the module
* **Title** - Level 1 heading describing the content


== Required Sections

* **[.video]** - Section containing the video embed
* **[.transcript]** - Written version of the video content


== Video Embedding

GraphAcademy supports YouTube videos using the video directive:

[source]
----
video::VIDEO_ID[youtube,width=560,height=315]
----


Replace `VIDEO_ID` with the YouTube video identifier.


== Best Practices

* Keep videos under 5 minutes when possible
* Provide complete transcripts for accessibility
* Include timestamps for key sections in long videos
* Use high-quality audio and clear visuals
* Add supplementary content after the transcript
* Test video playback before publishing


== Transcripts

Transcripts should:

* Match the video content closely
* Be formatted for easy reading (headings, paragraphs, lists)
* Include code examples shown in the video
* Provide links mentioned in the video
