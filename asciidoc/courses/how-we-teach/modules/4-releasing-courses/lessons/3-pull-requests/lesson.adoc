:type: lesson
:order: 2

You have tested your course locally and fixed any issues. To get your course reviewed and merged, you need to create a pull request on GitHub.

In this lesson, you will learn how to create effective pull requests for GraphAcademy course content.


== Before creating a PR

Ensure you have:

1. **Run all tests** locally and fixed any failures
2. **Built the course** successfully
3. **Committed your changes** with clear commit messages
4. **Pushed your branch** to the GitHub repository


== Creating the pull request

Navigate to the link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses[GraphAcademy courses repository^] and create a new pull request.


=== PR title

Use a clear, descriptive title that explains what the PR does:

* ✅ "Add How We Teach internal training course"
* ✅ "Update Neo4j Fundamentals lesson 3 based on feedback"
* ✅ "Fix broken links in Cypher Fundamentals module 2"
* ❌ "Updates"
* ❌ "Fix stuff"

* **Why** - Reason for the change (new course, feedback, bug fix)

The pre-push Git hook provides the complete URL with the appropriate template when you push your changes.


== Review process

After creating your PR:

1. **Automated tests run** - GitHub Actions validates your changes
2. **Team review** - Colleagues review content for quality and accuracy
3. **Feedback** - Reviewers may request changes or improvements
4. **Approval** - Once approved, your PR is ready to merge


== Responding to feedback

When reviewers request changes:

* **Address feedback promptly** - Review and respond to comments
* **Ask questions** - Clarify anything that's unclear
* **Make changes** - Update your branch with the modifications
* **Test again** - Ensure changes don't break anything
* **Push updates** - The PR will automatically update with your new commits



== Best practices

* Keep PRs focused - one feature or fix per PR
* Write clear commit messages
* Test thoroughly before requesting review
* Include context in your PR description
* Update documentation and the how-we-teach course if needed
