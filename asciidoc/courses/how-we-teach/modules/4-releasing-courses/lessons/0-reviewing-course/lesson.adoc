= Reviewing your course content
:type: lesson
:order: 0

You have created your course content with modules, lessons, and questions. Before submitting for review, you need to thoroughly review your work to ensure quality and completeness.

In this lesson, you will learn how to review your course content using AI tools, manual testing, and a comprehensive quality checklist.


== Using Cursor rules for AI-assisted review

GraphAcademy provides Cursor rules in the `.cursor/` directory to help you review and improve course content.


=== Review lesson content

To review individual lessons for structure, pedagogy, and clarity:

1. Tag the lesson in your message: `@lesson-folder/`
2. Tag the review rule: `@.cursor/review-lesson-content.mdc`
3. Ask Cursor to review the lesson

The AI will check:

* Grammar and formatting
* Length and scope
* Tone and clarity
* Pedagogical fit
* Opening structure (two-part pattern)
* Concept delivery
* Question quality
* Admonition formatting


=== Review entire course

To review the overall course structure and consistency:

1. Tag the course folder: `@asciidoc/courses/your-course/`
2. Tag the review rule: `@.cursor/review-course.mdc`
3. Ask Cursor to review the course

This checks for:

* Course-level consistency
* Module progression
* Learning objective alignment
* Content flow and pacing


=== Other helpful rules

* `@.cursor/write-theory-lesson.mdc` - Create or improve theory lessons
* `@.cursor/write-challenge-lesson.mdc` - Create challenge lessons
* `@.cursor/write-lesson-question.mdc` - Create lesson questions
* `@.cursor/technical-lesson-review.mdc` - Review technical accuracy


== Manual review checklist

In addition to AI-assisted review, you should manually verify your course works correctly.


=== 1. Local development environment

Start the local development server:

[source,bash]
----
npm run dev
----

This syncs your course content to the local Neo4j database and starts watching for changes.


=== 2. Navigate through every page

Visit each lesson in your browser and check:

* **Content renders correctly** - No broken formatting or missing content
* **Images display** - All images load and are appropriately sized
* **Code blocks are readable** - Syntax highlighting works, code is complete
* **Links work** - All internal and external links are valid
* **Admonitions render** - Tips, warnings, and notes display correctly
* **Videos play** - Video embeds work (if applicable)


=== 3. Complete the course as a learner

Experience your course from the learner's perspective:

* **Read every lesson** - Does the content make sense? Is it clear and concise?
* **Answer every question** - Are questions fair? Do you have enough information to answer? Are the hints and solutions supportive and helpful?
* **Complete every challenge** - Are instructions clear? Does verification work?
* **Check summaries** - Does each summary accurately reflect what was learned?
* **Follow the progression** - Does each lesson build logically on the previous one?


=== 4. Test questions thoroughly

For each question:

* **Try wrong answers** - Do hints help guide toward the correct answer?
* **Try correct answers** - Does the solution explain why it's correct?
* **Check for ambiguity** - Could multiple answers seem correct?
* **Verify coverage** - Was the answer covered in the lesson content?


=== 5. Test challenge verification

For challenge lessons with verification:

* **Complete the challenge** - Follow the instructions exactly
* **Submit verification** - Does it correctly detect completion?
* **Try incorrect solutions** - Does verification appropriately fail?
* **Check error messages** - Are they helpful and clear?


=== 6. Review for consistency

Check across the entire course:

* **Terminology** - Are terms used consistently throughout?
* **Examples** - Do examples build on each other appropriately?
* **Tone** - Is the writing style consistent across lessons?
* **Difficulty progression** - Does complexity increase gradually?
* **Code style** - If applicable, is code formatted consistently?


=== 7. Accessibility and inclusivity

Ensure your course is accessible to all learners:

* **Alt text for images** - All images have descriptive alt text
* **Clear language** - Avoid idioms or culture-specific references
* **Inclusive examples** - Use diverse names and scenarios
* **Color contrast** - Don't rely solely on color to convey information


== Final quality checklist

Before submitting your course for review, confirm:

- [ ] All lessons follow the two-part opening structure (context + learning objective)
- [ ] Every lesson has a summary section
- [ ] All admonitions have titles
- [ ] All questions have hints and solutions
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] All links are valid (no 404s)
- [ ] Code blocks have appropriate syntax highlighting
- [ ] The course runs locally without errors
- [ ] You've completed the course as a learner
- [ ] All questions can be answered from lesson content
- [ ] Challenge verifications work correctly
- [ ] Content is free of typos and grammatical errors
- [ ] Terminology is used consistently
- [ ] Learning objectives align with actual content


== Best practices

* Review in multiple passes - don't try to catch everything at once
* Take breaks between review sessions for fresh perspective
* Ask a colleague to test your course
* Use both AI assistance and manual review
* Document any known issues or limitations
* Fix issues immediately rather than accumulating them
* Review one more time after making fixes
