To pass this challenge you must run the two queries below in order.

First, use the `m.released` property to create an `ACTED_IN_{year}` relationship between the Actor and the Movie:

.1. Create ACTED_IN_{year} relationships
[source,cypher]
----
include::../solution.cypher[tag="actedin"]

This query should create **5** relationships.

Then, use the same property to create a `DIRECTED_{year}` relationship between the Director and the Movie:

.2. Create DIRECTED_{year} relationships
[source,cypher]
----
include::../solution.cypher[tag="directed"]

This query should create **2** relationships.

Then click **Try Again**.
