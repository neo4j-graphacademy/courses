= 1. Adding a new relationship to the model

What Relationship Type should we use when creating a relationship between _User_ nodes and _Movie_ to represent a rating?


input::answer[]

* [x] RATED


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
A common way of talking about movie ratings is that a user has *rated* a movie.
Once the data is created, the act of rating the movie is in the past so it makes sense to use the *past tense*.

Relationship types should be represented as `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
