This is what the instance model will be refactored to:

== Creating Language Nodes

Execute this code to refactor the graph to turn the _languages_ property values into _Language_ nodes:

.Creating Language Nodes
[source,cypher]
----
include::solution.cypher[]
----

== Modifying the Cypher statement

This is the Cypher code for what our use case used to be before the refactoring.

.Previous Query
[source,cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE 'Italian' IN m.languages
RETURN m.title
----


This query can now be modified to instead use the newly-created Language node.

.Using the Language Node
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:IN_LANGUAGE]-(l:Language)
WHERE  l.name = 'Italian'
RETURN m.title
----


This is the only use case that deals with languages so we need not retest all of our queries after the refactor.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can refactor the graph to add nodes to replace duplication in properties.

In the next challenge, you will perform some additional factoring to eliminate duplication.
