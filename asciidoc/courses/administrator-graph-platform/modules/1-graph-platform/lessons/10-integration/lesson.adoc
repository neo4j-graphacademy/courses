== Neo4j Integrations

Neo4j has integrations with many systems in the IoT ecosystem. Neo4j can be part of a system that uses GRANDstack, Kettle, Docker, and many others.
How you integrate Neo4j into a larger system will depend on how you intend to use Neo4j.
Neo4j engineers and Community members have worked through some of the challenges of integration and their discussions and work can be found in the https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j online forum^], https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neo4j[stack overflow^], and on https://github.com/neo4j-contrib[Github^].
