= Benefits of Neo4j
:type: quiz
:order: 2



The Neo4j DBMS provides the following benefits that are critical to most Enterprise applications:

* Optimized graph engine
* Index-free adjacency
* ACID transactions
* Failover and scalability

== Optimized graph engine

image::images/Neo4jDatabase.png[Neo4jDatabase,width=300,align=center]

The Neo4j graph engine interprets Cypher statements to:

* Execute kernel-level code for optimal performance.
* Optimize data access on disk and cached in memory.

The graph engine has been improved with every release of Neo4j to provide the most efficient access to an application's graph data. There are many ways that you can tune the performance of the engine to suit your particular application needs.

== Index-free adjacency (IFA)

One of the key features that makes Neo4j graph databases different from an RDBMS is that Neo4j implements
*index-free adjacency*.

To better understand the benefit of index-free adjacency, let's look at how a query executes in an RDBMS.
Suppose you have this table in the RDBMS:

image::images/RelationalTable1.png[RelationalTable1,width=300,align=center]

You execute this SQL query to find the third-degree parents of the group with the ID of 3:

[source,SQL,role=noplay nocopy]
----
SELECT PARENT_ID
FROM GROUPS
WHERE ID = (SELECT PARENT_ID
    FROM GROUPS
    WHERE ID = (SELECT PARENT_ID
        FROM GROUPS
        WHERE ID = 3))
----

The result of this query is 1, but in order to determine this result, the query engine needed to:

. Locate the innermost clause.
. Build the query plan for the subclause.
. Execute the query plan for the subclause.
. Locate the next innermost clause.
. Repeat Steps 2-4.

Resulting in:

* 3 planning cycles
* 3 index lookups
* 3 DB reads

With index-free adjacency, Neo4j stores nodes and relationships as objects that are linked to each other via pointers.
Conceptually, the graph looks like:

image::images/IFA-1-new.png[IFA-1-new,width=400,align=center]

These nodes and relationships are stored as:

image::images/IFA-2-new.png[IFA-2-new,width=400,align=center]

Suppose we had this query in Cypher:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay nocopy]
----
MATCH (n) <-- (:Group) <-- (:Group) <-- (:Group {id: 3})
RETURN n.id
----

Using IFA, the Neo4j query engine starts with the anchor of the query which is the Group node with the id of 3.
Then it uses the links stored in the relationship and node objects to traverse the graph pattern.

To perform this query, the Neo4j query engine needed to:

* Plan the query based upon the anchor specified.
* Use an index to retrieve the anchor node.
* Follow pointers to retrieve the desired result node.

The benefits of IFA compared to relational DBMS access, there are:

* Much fewer index lookups or table scans.
* Reduced duplication of foreign keys.

== ACID transactions

Transactionality is very important for robust applications that require an ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) guarantee for their data.
If a relationship between nodes is created, not only is the relationship created, but the nodes are updated as connected.
All of these updates to the database must *all* succeed or fail.

This is important since true ACID compliance is rare in the No-SQL data management world.

== Failover and scalability

image::images/Clustering.png[Clustering,width=600,align=center]


Neo4j supports clusters that provide high availability, scalability for read access to the data, and failover which is important to many enterprises.
Neo4j clusters also maintain ACID transactions across all locations.

[IMPORTANT]
Neo4j clusters are only available with Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
