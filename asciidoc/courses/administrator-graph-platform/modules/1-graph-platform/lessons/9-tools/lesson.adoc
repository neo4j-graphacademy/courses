The three main tools used that are part of the Neo4j installation (located in the *bin* directory) include:

* *neo4j* can be used to start, stop, and retrieve the status of a Neo4j DBMS instance.
* *neo4j-admin* can be used for things like create, copy, dump, load, and backup a database.
* *cypher-shell* can be used to query the database using a command-line interface.


=== cypher-shell

cypher-shell is part of the Neo4j installation and is located in the *bin* directory.
It is a command-line tool that you can use to connect to a Neo4j DBMS instance and run Cypher statements against the database.

It is useful if you want to create scripts that automatically run against the database(s).
It is commonly used for advanced query tuning.

Even if you have not installed Neo4j, you can download and install cypher-shell as a stand-alone application if you want to connect to a running database and execute Cypher queries.
