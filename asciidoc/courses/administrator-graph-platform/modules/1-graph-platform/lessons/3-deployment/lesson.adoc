= Neo4j Deployment Options
:type: quiz
:order: 3

There are many ways that an application can be deployed with Neo4j:

* Neo4j DBMS instances hosted on Enterprise servers.
* Neo4j DBMS instances hosted in the Cloud.
* Neo4j DBMS embedded in an application.

== Enterprise server instances

Applications can be developed using any language for which there is a driver that can connect to Neo4j.

Each application (Neo4j client) communicates with Neo4j to access the graph using the Bolt or HTTP protocol.
Neo4j-supported and some community drivers use the Bolt protocol.
The clients can be JVMs, .NET resources, a Web server, all of which can be accessed by an end-user.

And if the Enterprise requires high-availability or scalability, they can host multiple Neo4j Enterprise Edition instances on multiple servers in many locations using clustering.

== Cloud instances

Neo4j Aura is the simplest way to run the Neo4j DBMS in the cloud.

* The Neo4j team manages the administration of Neo4j.
* Provides Enterprise Edition features including high-availability.
* Developers focus on creating Neo4j applications.

You can also manage your own Neo4j Enterprise or Community instances with these technologies:

* Amazon EC2
* Google Cloud Platform
* Microsoft Azure
* Docker
* Kubernetes

== Embedded instances

This architecture is more common in OEM setups, where Neo4j DBMS runs integrated as part of a third party product.
When Neo4j DBMS is embedded directly into an application, you get all the functionality of the database directly accessible through the Java APIs used by the application code.
This makes it very easy to directly work with the database and get lightning fast performance.
