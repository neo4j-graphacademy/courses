= Search using a Vector Index
:order: 3
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

The Neo4j sandbox contains a sample of 1000 embeddings for movie plots.
Running the following Cypher query will return the titles and plots for the movies that have embeddings:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.plotEmbedding IS NOT NULL
RETURN m.title, m.plot
----

Review the movies and find a plot that you think looks interesting.

You can adapt the query to only return a named movie by adding a filter:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Toy Story"})
RETURN m.title, m.plot
----

== Finding similar movies

You can view the embedding for a movie plot by running the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Toy Story"})
RETURN m.title, m.plotEmbedding
----

You can find similar movies using the embedding for the movie plot and a vector index.

You can query the vector index to find similar movies by running the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Toy Story'})

CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('moviePlots', 6, m.plotEmbedding)
YIELD node, score

RETURN node.title, node.plot, score
----

The `db.index.vector.queryNodes` procedure takes three arguments:

* The name of the vector index to query - `moviePlots`
* The number of results to return - `6`
* The embedding to search for - `m.plotEmbedding`

Experiment with the query to find similar movies to the one you searched earlier.
