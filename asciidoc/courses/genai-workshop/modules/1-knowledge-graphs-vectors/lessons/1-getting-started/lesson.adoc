You will need link:https://python.org[Python] installed and the ability to install packages using `pip`.

You may want to set up a virtual environment using link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[`venv`^] or link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[`virtualenv`^] to keep your dependencies separate from other projects.

Clone the link:{repository-link}[github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-workshop] repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-workshop
----

Install the required packages using `pip`:

[source,bash]
----
cd genai-workshop-graphrag
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

You do not need to create a Neo4j database as you will use the provided sandbox instance.
The sandbox includes Neo4j's GenAI functions which you can learn more about in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/[Neo4j GenAI integration documentation^].

== Test your setup

You can test your setup by running `test_environment.py` - this will attempt to connect to the Neo4j sandbox and the OpenAI API.

You will see an `OK` message if you have set up your environment correctly. If any tests fail, check the contents of the `.env` file.
