= Import Unstructured Data
:order: 7
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true
:branch: main

You will use Python and LangChain to chunk up course content and create embeddings for each chunk. 
You will then load the chunks into a Neo4j graph database.


== The course content

You will load the content from the course link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-fundamentals/[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^].

The workshop repository you cloned contains the course data.

Open the `1-knowledge-graphs-vectors\data` directory in your code editor.

You should note the following structure:

* `asciidoc` - contains the course content in ascidoc format
** `courses` - the course content
*** `llm-fundamentals` - the course name
**** `modules` - contains numbered directories for each module
***** `01-name` - the module name
****** `lessons` - contains numbered directories for each lesson
******* `01-name` - the lesson name
******** `lesson.adoc` - the lesson content

== Load the content and chunk it

You will load the content and chunk it using Python and LangChain.

Your code will split the lesson content into chunks of text, around 1500 characters long, each containing one or more paragraphs. 
You can determine the paragraph in the content with two newline characters (`\n\n`).

Open the `1-knowledge-graphs-vectors/create_vector.py` file and review the program:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/1-knowledge-graphs-vectors/create_vector.py[]
----

The program uses the link:https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.directory.DirectoryLoader.html[`DirectoryLoader`^] class to load the content from the `data/asciidoc` directory.

Your task is to add the code to:

. Create a link:https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/text_splitter/langchain.text_splitter.CharacterTextSplitter.html[`CharacterTextSplitter`^] object to split the content into chunks of text.
. Use the `split_documents` method to split the documents into chunks of text based on the existence of `\n\n` and a chunk size of 1500 characters.

Create the CharacterTextSplitter object to split the content into paragraphs (`\n\n`).

Split the documents into chunks of text.

[TIP]
You can run your code now to see the chunks of text.

.More on splitting
====
The content isn't split simply by a character (`\n\n`) or on a fixed number of characters.
The process is more complicated. 
Chunks should be up to maximum size but conform to the character split.

In this example, the `split_documents` method does the following:

. Splits the documents into paragraphs (using the `separator` - `\n\n`)
. Combines the paragraphs into chunks of text that are up 1500 characters (`chunk_size`)
** if a single paragraph is longer than 1500 characters, the method will not split the paragraph but create a chunk larger than 1500 characters
. Adds the last paragraph in a chunk to the start of the next paragraph to create an overlap between chunks. 
** if the last paragraph in a chunk is more than 200 characters (`chunk_overlap`) it will *not* be added to the next chunk

This process ensures that:

* Chunks are never too small.
* That a paragraph is never split between chunks.
* That chunks are significantly different, and the overlap doesn't result in a lot of repeated content.

Investigate what happens when you modify the `separator`, `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters.

== Create vector index

Once you have chunked the content, you can use the LangChain link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/neo4jvector[`Neo4jVector`^] class to create embeddings, a vector index, and store the chunks in a Neo4j graph database.

You will need to modify your Python program:

. Connect to the Neo4j database.

. Create the nodes and vector index.

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/1-knowledge-graphs-vectors/solutions/create_vector.py[tag=import_vector]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/1-knowledge-graphs-vectors/solutions/create_vector.py[tag=vector]
----

The code will create 'Chunk' nodes with `text` and `embedding` properties and a vector index called `chunkVector`.
You should be able to identify where you pass the `Chunk`, `text`, `embedding`, and `chunkVector` parameters.

Run the program to create the chunk nodes and vector index. It may take a minute or two to complete.

== View chunks in the sandbox

You can now view the chunks in the Neo4j sandbox.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Chunk) RETURN c LIMIT 25
----

You can also query the vector index to find similar chunks.
For example, you can find lesson chunks relating to a specific question, "What does Hallucination mean?":

[source,cypher]
----
WITH genai.vector.encode(
    "What does Hallucination mean?", 
    "OpenAI", 
    { token: "sk-..." }) AS userEmbedding
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('chunkVector', 6, userEmbedding)
YIELD node, score
RETURN node.text, score
----

[IMPORTANT]
Remember to replace `sk-...` with your OpenAI API key.

Experiment with different questions and see how the vector index can find similar chunks.
