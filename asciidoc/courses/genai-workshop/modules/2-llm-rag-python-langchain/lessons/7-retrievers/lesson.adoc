link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/[Retrievers^] are LangChain chain components that allow you to retrieve documents using an unstructured query.

    Find a movie plot about a robot that wants to be human.

Documents are any unstructured text that you want to retrieve. 
A retriever often uses a vector store as its underlying data structure.

Retrievers are a key component for creating models that can take advantage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

In the previous workshop, you used a vector index of Movie plots - in this example, the movie plots are the _documents_, and you can use a _retriever_ could to give a model context.

== Neo4jVector

The link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/neo4jvector[`Neo4jVector`^] is a LangChain vector store that uses a Neo4j database as the underlying data structure.

You used the `Neo4jVector` to generate embeddings, store them in the database, and retrieve them.
You can also use the `Neo4jVector` to query a vector index.

Open the `2-llm-rag-python-langchain/query_vector.py` file and review the code.
The program creates a `Neo4jVector` from the `moviePlots` vector index and uses the similarity_search() method to retrieve the movie plots as documents.

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/2-llm-rag-python-langchain/query_vector.py[]
----

Run the code and review the results. Try different queries and see what results you get.

The `similarity_search()` method returns a list of link:https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html[`Document`^] objects. The `Document` object includes the properties:

* `page_content` - the content referenced by the index, in this example the plot of the movie
* `meta_data` - a dictionary of the `Movie` node properties returned by the index

[TIP]
.Specify the number of documents
====
You can pass an optional `k` argument to the `similarity_search()` method to specify the number of documents to return. The default is 4.

vector.similarity_search(query, k=1)

Retrievers and vector indexes allow you to incorporate unstructured data into your LangChain applications.

== Lesson Summary

You learned about retrievers and how they can use Neo4j vectors to retrieve documents.

Next you will add a retriever chain to your agent.
