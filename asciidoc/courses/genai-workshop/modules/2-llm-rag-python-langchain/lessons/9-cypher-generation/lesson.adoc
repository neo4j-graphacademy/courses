LLMs are good at writing Cypher queries when given good information, such as:

* The schema of the graph
* Context about the question
* Examples of questions and appropriate Cypher queries

You will learn how to use a language model to generate Cypher queries to query a Neo4j graph database.

== Generating Cypher

LangChain includes the link:https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/neo4j/chains/langchain_neo4j.chains.graph_qa.cypher.GraphCypherQAChain.html[`GraphCypherQAChain`^]chain that can interact with a Neo4j graph database. It uses a language model to generate Cypher queries and then uses the graph to answer the question.

Open the `2-llm-rag-python-langchain/cypher_chain.py` file and review the code.

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/2-llm-rag-python-langchain/cypher_chain.py[]
----

The program will generate a Cypher query based on the `question` and the graph database `schema`.

When you run the program, you should see the Cypher generated from the question and the data it returned. Something similar to:

    Generated Cypher:
    MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Toy Story"})
    RETURN m.plot
    Full Context:
    [{'m.plot': "A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new spaceman 
    figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's room."}]

The LLM used the database schema to generate an _appropriate_ Cypher query. LangChain then executed the query against the graph database, and the result returned.

== Inconsistent Results

Investigate what happens when you ask the same question multiple times. Observe the generated Cypher query and the response.

    "What role did Tom Hanks play in Toy Story?"

You will likely see different results each time you run the program.

    MATCH (actor:Actor {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie {title: 'Toy Story'})
    RETURN actor.name, movie.title, movie.year, movie.runtime, movie.plot

    MATCH (a:Actor {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'Toy Story'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(p:Person)
    RETURN p.name AS role

The LLM doesn't return consistent results - its objective is to produce an answer, not the same response, and they may not be correct.
The response may not be correct or even generate an error due to invalid Cypher.

You can improve the responses by providing additional context and instructions to the LLM

== Provide specific instructions

The LLM's training data included many Cypher statements, but these statements were not specific to the structure of your graph database. 

You can provide specific instructions to the LLM to state that the generated Cypher statements should follow the schema.

The LLM may also need additional instructions about the data. 
For movie titles that begin with "The", move "the" to the end.

You can also instruct the LLM on how to respond.
For example, only when it requires a Cypher statement and when it returns data.

== Examples

Even with specific instructions, the LLM can still make mistakes.
You can provide examples of questions and appropriate Cypher.
This technique is known as link:https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot[Few-Shot Prompting^].

For example, you could provide an example of how to find movies and genres:
