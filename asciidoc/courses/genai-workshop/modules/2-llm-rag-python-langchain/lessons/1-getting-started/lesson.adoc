You will be using the same link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-workshop[repository^] you created in the first workshop, Knowledge Graphs, Unstructured Data, and Vectors. If you have already set up your environment, you can skip this task.

Return to the link:../../../1-knowledge-graphs-vectors/1-getting-started[Getting Started^] task if you need to create an environment. 

== Test your setup

It is a good idea to retest your setup to ensure nothing has changed. You can test your setup by running `test_environment.py` - this will attempt to connect to the Neo4j sandbox and the OpenAI API.

You will see an `OK` message if you have set up your environment correctly. If any tests fail, check the contents of the `.env` file.

== Continue

When you are ready, you can move on to the next task.
