You will use the same link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-workshop[repository^] you created in the first workshop, Knowledge Graphs, Unstructured Data, and Vectors. 
You can skip this task if you have already set up your environment

Return to the link:../../1-knowledge-graphs-vectors/1-getting-started[Getting Started] task if you need to create an environment. 

== Test your setup

Retesting your setup to ensure nothing has changed is a good idea. 
You can test your setup by running `test_environment.py` - this will attempt to connect to the Neo4j sandbox and the OpenAI API.

You will see an `OK` message if you have set up your environment correctly. 
If any tests fail, return to the link:../../1-knowledge-graphs-vectors/1-getting-started[Getting Started] lesson and check your set up.

== Continue

When you are ready, you can move on to the next task.
