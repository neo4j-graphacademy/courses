    "## Module Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you learned to:\n",
    "- Implement vector-based semantic retrieval with Neo4j\n",
    "- Design sophisticated graph traversal retrieval patterns\n",
    "- Combine multiple retrieval strategies for optimal results\n",
    "- Optimize retrieval for token constraints and performance\n",
    "- Build complete GraphRAG systems with explanation capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Vector Similarity**: Provides semantic understanding and content-based matching\n",
    "- **Graph Traversal**: Reveals structural relationships and contextual connections\n",
    "- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine strengths of multiple methods for better results\n",
    "- **Token Optimization**: Essential for real-world LLM applications with context limits\n",
    "- **Explainability**: Critical for debugging and improving retrieval systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Applications\n",
    "- **Research Discovery**: Find related papers and concepts through graph relationships\n",
    "- **Document Retrieval**: Combine semantic and structural search for enterprise knowledge\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Use graph connections to suggest relevant content\n",
    "- **Question Answering**: Provide rich context for LLM-powered Q&A systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Insights\n",
    "- Vector similarity excels at semantic matching but may miss structural relationships\n",
    "- Graph traversal finds unexpected connections but can be computationally expensive\n",
    "- Hybrid methods consistently outperform single approaches\n",
    "- Token optimization is crucial for production deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Module\n",
    "Module 6: Agents - Learn how to build intelligent agents that can reason over graph knowledge and take actions based on retrieved information."
