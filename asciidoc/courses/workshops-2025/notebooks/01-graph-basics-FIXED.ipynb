    "Welcome to your journey into the world of graph databases! In this module, you'll discover why graphs are revolutionizing how we think about connected data and learn the foundations that will power your AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you'll be able to:\n",
    "- Understand what makes graph databases unique and powerful\n",
    "- Connect to Neo4j and navigate the basics\n",
    "- Write fundamental Cypher queries to explore data\n",
    "- Model real-world problems as graphs\n",
    "- Recognize when to use graphs vs. traditional databases\n",

    "```\n",

    "The magic happens when you need to ask questions like:\n",
    "- \"Which customers bought similar products?\"\n",
    "- \"What's the shortest path between two people in a social network?\"\n",
    "- \"Which accounts are connected through suspicious transactions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are **natural** in graphs but **complex** in traditional databases.\n",

You need to answer:\n\n> *\"Show me products that customers similar to John have purchased, but that John hasn't bought yet.\"*\n\nIn a traditional SQL database, this requires complex joins:\n\n```sql\n-- Find products that customers similar to John have purchased\n-- but that John hasn't bought yet (SQL version)\nSELECT DISTINCT p2.product_name, COUNT(*) as recommendation_score\nFROM customers john\nJOIN purchases jp ON john.customer_id = jp.customer_id\nJOIN purchases similar_purchases ON jp.product_id = similar_purchases.product_id\nJOIN customers similar_customers ON similar_purchases.customer_id = similar_customers.customer_id\nJOIN purchases recommendations ON similar_customers.customer_id = recommendations.customer_id\nJOIN products p2 ON recommendations.product_id = p2.product_id\nLEFT JOIN purchases john_already_bought \n    ON john.customer_id = john_already_bought.customer_id \n    AND p2.product_id = john_already_bought.product_id\nWHERE john.name = 'John' \n    AND similar_customers.customer_id != john.customer_id\n    AND john_already_bought.product_id IS NULL\nGROUP BY p2.product_name\nORDER BY recommendation_score DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nIn a graph database, the same logic is much clearer:\n\n```cypher\n// Find customers who bought the same products as John\nMATCH (john:Customer {name: 'John'})-[:PURCHASED]->(product)<-[:PURCHASED]-(similar:Customer)\nWHERE john <> similar\n\n// Find products these similar customers bought that John hasn't\nMATCH (similar)-[:PURCHASED]->(recommendation)\nWHERE NOT (john)-[:PURCHASED]->(recommendation)\n\n// Return recommendations with popularity score\nRETURN recommendation.name as product, \n       count(similar) as popularity_score\nORDER BY popularity_score DESC\nLIMIT 5\n```\n\nThe graph version reads like English: *\"Find customers similar to John, see what they bought that John hasn't, and recommend the most popular items.\"*\n\n## üß© Core Graph Concepts\n\nEvery graph database has three fundamental building blocks:\n\n### 1. **Nodes** (The \"Things\")\n- Represent entities in your domain\n- Like rows in a table, but more flexible\n- Examples: Person, Product, Company, Account\n\n### 2. **Relationships** (The \"Connections\")\n- Connect nodes with meaning\n- Have direction and type\n- Examples: FRIENDS_WITH, PURCHASED, WORKS_FOR, TRANSFERRED_TO\n\n### 3. **Properties** (The \"Details\")\n- Key-value pairs on nodes and relationships\n- Store the actual data\n- Examples: name, age, amount, timestamp\n\n## üí° Your First Mental Model\n\nThink of a graph like a city map:\n- **Nodes** = Intersections (places)\n- **Relationships** = Roads (connections)\n- **Properties** = Street names, distances, traffic lights (details)\n\nJust like you can find the shortest route between two intersections, you can find the shortest path between any two nodes in your data!",
