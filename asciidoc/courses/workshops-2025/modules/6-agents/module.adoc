== Module Overview

This advanced module covers building intelligent agents that can reason over graph knowledge, make decisions, and take actions based on complex graph-based reasoning patterns.

=== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

* Design agent architectures that leverage graph knowledge
* Implement reasoning patterns over graph structures
* Build agents that can query and update knowledge graphs
* Create multi-agent systems with graph-based coordination
* Implement agent memory using graph structures
* Evaluate agent performance and reasoning quality

=== Prerequisites

* Completion of Module 5: Retrievers
* Understanding of LLM agent concepts
* Familiarity with reasoning patterns

=== Module Structure

This module consists of 4 progressive lessons:

1. **Agent Architecture** (25 min) - Graph-enhanced agent design patterns
2. **Graph-Based Reasoning** (30 min) - Multi-hop reasoning and logic
3. **Tool Integration** (25 min) - Graph operations and dynamic queries
4. **Hands-on Exercise** (20 min) - Complete financial analysis agent

=== Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, participants will have:

* Understanding of graph-enhanced agent architectures

== Module Assessment

=== Knowledge Check Questions

1. What are the key advantages of graph-enhanced agent architectures?
2. How do you implement multi-hop reasoning over graph structures?
3. What safety measures are important for dynamic query generation?
4. How do you evaluate the quality of agent reasoning chains?

=== Practical Assessment

Participants should demonstrate:
* Designing appropriate agent architectures for graph knowledge
* Implementing graph-based reasoning patterns
* Building agents that can use graph tools effectively
* Creating transparent and explainable agent systems

== Module Summary

This module covered advanced agent architectures that leverage graph knowledge for sophisticated reasoning and decision-making. Participants learned to build intelligent agents that can reason over complex graph structures and provide transparent, evidence-based responses.

The agent development skills learned here - graph reasoning, tool integration, and transparent explanation - enable building sophisticated AI systems that can work with complex domain knowledge.
