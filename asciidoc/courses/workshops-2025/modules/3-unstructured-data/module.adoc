:duration: 75 minutes

== Module Overview

This module covers processing unstructured text data, creating knowledge graphs from documents, and implementing vector embeddings for semantic search through progressive lessons.

=== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

* Extract entities and relationships from unstructured text
* Create knowledge graphs from document collections
* Implement vector embeddings and semantic search
* Combine structured and unstructured data in graphs
* Build text-to-graph pipelines using LLMs

=== Prerequisites

* Completion of Module 2: Structured Data
* Basic understanding of NLP concepts
* Familiarity with text processing

=== Module Structure

This module consists of 4 progressive lessons:

1. **Text Processing Fundamentals** (20 min) - Preprocessing and entity extraction basics
2. **Entity Extraction and Relationship Discovery** (25 min) - Advanced NLP techniques
3. **Vector Embeddings and Semantic Search** (20 min) - Implementing semantic similarity
4. **Hands-on Exercise** (10 min) - Complete document knowledge graph creation

=== Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, participants will have:

* Practical experience with text processing pipelines
* Knowledge of entity and relationship extraction techniques
* Understanding of vector embeddings and semantic search
* Hands-on experience building knowledge graphs from documents
* Skills to combine structured and unstructured data sources

== Module Assessment

=== Knowledge Check Questions

1. What are the key steps in transforming text to knowledge graphs?
2. When should you use rule-based vs. ML-based entity extraction?
3. How do vector embeddings enable semantic search?
4. What are the benefits of combining structured and unstructured data?

=== Practical Assessment

Participants should demonstrate:
* Processing unstructured text with appropriate preprocessing
* Extracting entities and relationships using multiple techniques
* Implementing vector similarity search
* Creating comprehensive knowledge graphs from documents

== Module Summary

This module covered the essential techniques for processing unstructured data and creating knowledge graphs. Participants learned to extract meaningful information from text, implement semantic search, and integrate unstructured content with structured data.

The skills developed here - text processing, entity extraction, and vector embeddings - form the foundation for advanced AI applications including RAG systems and intelligent agents.
