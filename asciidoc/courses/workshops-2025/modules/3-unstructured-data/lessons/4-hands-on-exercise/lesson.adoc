= Hands-on Exercise: Complete Knowledge Graph Construction
:type: lesson
:order: 4
:duration: 30 minutes

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Build an end-to-end knowledge extraction pipeline
* Process real documents and create comprehensive knowledge graphs
* Implement hybrid search combining text and graph traversal
* Analyze and visualize knowledge graph structures

== Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you'll build a complete document processing and knowledge graph system that:

1. **Ingests** multiple document types (news articles, research papers, reports)
2. **Extracts** entities, relationships, and key concepts
3. **Creates** embeddings for semantic search
4. **Builds** a comprehensive knowledge graph in Neo4j
5. **Implements** advanced search and analysis capabilities

== Setting Up the Pipeline

                Researchers at Stanford University, led by Dr. Sarah Chen, have announced a groundbreaking 
                advancement in natural language processing. The new transformer architecture, called 
                "NeuroLang-X", demonstrates unprecedented performance on complex reasoning tasks.
                
                The research team, which includes collaborators from Google AI and OpenAI, tested the 
                model on various benchmarks including GLUE, SuperGLUE, and custom financial reasoning tasks. 
                NeuroLang-X achieved 94.2% accuracy on the most challenging datasets, surpassing previous 
                state-of-the-art models by 8.7%.
                
                "This breakthrough represents a significant step toward artificial general intelligence," 
                said Dr. Chen during the announcement at the International Conference on Machine Learning. 
                The model's architecture incorporates novel attention mechanisms and memory-augmented neural networks.
                
                Microsoft announced plans to integrate NeuroLang-X into its Azure Cognitive Services platform, 
                while Amazon Web Services expressed interest in licensing the technology for its cloud offerings.
                Industry experts predict this advancement could accelerate adoption of AI in sectors like 
                healthcare, finance, and legal services.

== Exercise Completion and Assessment

=== Knowledge Check Questions

1. **Entity Extraction**: What are the advantages of using a hybrid approach (rule-based + ML) for entity extraction?

2. **Vector Embeddings**: How do vector embeddings enable semantic search beyond keyword matching?

3. **Knowledge Graph Design**: What factors should you consider when deciding whether to create a new entity type vs. using properties?

4. **Cross-Document Analysis**: How can co-occurrence relationships help in knowledge discovery?

=== Practical Assessment

Complete these tasks using the knowledge graph you've built:

1. **Semantic Search**: Find documents related to "economic policy" using vector similarity
2. **Entity Analysis**: Explore the connections of a major company entity
3. **Topic Discovery**: Identify topics that span multiple document categories
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Trace how entities connect across different domains
