:order: 5
:type: module
:duration: 75 minutes

== Module Overview

This module focuses on implementing retrieval patterns for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using graph databases, combining semantic search with graph traversal for enhanced context retrieval.

=== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

* Implement vector-based semantic retrieval in Neo4j
* Design graph traversal retrieval patterns
* Combine vector and graph retrieval strategies
* Optimize retrieval performance and relevance
* Build hybrid retrievers for complex queries
* Evaluate retrieval quality and effectiveness

=== Prerequisites

* Completion of Module 4: Graph Analytics
* Understanding of vector embeddings
* Basic knowledge of RAG concepts

=== Module Structure

This module consists of 4 progressive lessons:

1. **Vector Similarity Search** (20 min) - Implementing semantic search with embeddings
2. **Graph Traversal Retrieval** (25 min) - Relationship-based information discovery
3. **Hybrid Retrieval Strategies** (20 min) - Combining approaches for optimal results
4. **Hands-on Exercise** (10 min) - Complete GraphRAG retrieval system

=== Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, participants will have:

* Practical experience with vector similarity search
* Knowledge of graph traversal retrieval patterns
* Understanding of hybrid retrieval strategies
* Hands-on experience building complete RAG systems
* Skills to optimize retrieval for specific use cases

== Module Assessment

=== Knowledge Check Questions

1. When should you use vector search vs. graph traversal retrieval?
2. How do you optimize context windows for LLM token limits?
3. What are the key components of a hybrid retrieval system?
4. How do you evaluate retrieval quality and relevance?

=== Practical Assessment

Participants should demonstrate:
* Implementing vector similarity search with proper indexing
* Designing graph traversal patterns for context discovery
* Building hybrid retrievers that combine multiple strategies
* Optimizing retrieval results for specific query types

== Module Summary

This module covered advanced retrieval patterns that combine the power of vector search with graph relationships. Participants learned to implement sophisticated RAG systems that provide rich, contextual information to LLM applications.

The retrieval techniques developed here - semantic search, graph traversal, and hybrid strategies - enable building RAG systems that understand both content similarity and structural relationships.
