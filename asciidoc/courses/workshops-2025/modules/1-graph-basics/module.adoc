= Graph Basics
:order: 1
:type: module
:duration: 45 minutes

== Module Overview

This foundational module introduces participants to graph thinking and Neo4j fundamentals through progressive lessons and hands-on exercises.

=== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

* Explain what graphs are and why they matter for AI applications
* Understand nodes, relationships, and properties in Neo4j
* Write basic Cypher queries to explore graph data
* Connect graph concepts to AI/ML use cases

=== Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of data concepts
* No prior graph database experience required

=== Module Structure

This module consists of 4 progressive lessons:

1. **What are Graphs?** (10 min) - Core concepts and AI applications
2. **Introduction to Neo4j** (10 min) - Platform overview and ecosystem
3. **Basic Cypher Queries** (15 min) - Query language fundamentals
4. **Hands-on Exercise** (10 min) - Practical exploration with financial data

=== Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, participants will have:

* Solid understanding of graph database concepts
* Familiarity with Neo4j Browser interface
* Ability to write basic Cypher queries
* Recognition of graph patterns relevant to AI applications
* Hands-on experience with real financial data

== Module Assessment

=== Knowledge Check Questions

1. What are the three main components of a graph database?
2. How does graph traversal differ from SQL joins?
3. Write a Cypher query to find all customers with more than one account
4. Identify a business scenario where graphs would outperform relational databases

=== Practical Assessment

Participants should demonstrate:
* Ability to navigate Neo4j Browser
* Writing basic MATCH patterns
* Using WHERE clauses for filtering
* Interpreting query results for business insights

== Module Summary

This module established the foundation for understanding graphs in the context of AI applications. Participants should now understand basic graph concepts and be able to explore graph data using simple Cypher queries.

The patterns and concepts learned here - nodes, relationships, traversals, and pattern matching - form the building blocks for all subsequent modules in the workshop series.
