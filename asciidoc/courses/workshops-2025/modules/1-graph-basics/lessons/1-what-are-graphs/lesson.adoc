== What is a graph

[.col]
====
Neo4j is a graph database that stores data in a graph.
Data is stored as nodes and relationships instead of tables or documents.

Graph databases are particularly useful when _the connections between data are as important as the data itself_.

[.transcript-only]
=====
In this lesson, you will learn about graphs and the elements that make up a Neo4j graph database.

_A graph shows how financial entities are related to each other._
=====

The objects are referred to as *nodes* (vertices) connected by *relationships* (edges).

Neo4j uses the graph structure to store data and is known as a **labeled property graph**.
====

[.col]
----
    (Customer)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(Account)
         |                        |
    [:LIVES_IN]              [:TRANSACTION]
         |                        |
         v                        v
    (Location)               (Account)

== Nodes, Relationships, Labels, and Properties

Data within Neo4j is stored and organized using:

* *Nodes*
* *Relationships*
* *Labels*
* *Properties*

[.slide.col-2]
== Nodes

[.col]
====
*Nodes* are the circles in a graph.
Nodes typically represent _objects_ or _entities_.

Imagine a financial network, the entities (e.g. customers, accounts, companies) would be represented by nodes.

Each entity would be stored as a separate node in the graph.
====

[.col]
----
(Alice)    (Account-1234)    (Apple Inc)
  
(New York)    (Transaction)    (BlackRock)
----

[.slide.col-2]
== Labels

[.col]
====
Nodes are grouped by or categorized using *labels*. 
Labels describe what the nodes are, for example, `Customer`, `Account`, `Company`.

Nodes of the same type would have the same label.
====

[.col]
----
(alice:Customer)  (acct:Account)  (apple:Company)

(nyc:Location)    (txn:Transaction)    (br:AssetManager)
----

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== Labels

[.col]
====
Labels allow you to distinguish between different types of nodes and filter the graph.

Nodes can have multiple labels, for example, Alice is a `Customer` and could also be a `HighValueCustomer`.
====

[.col]
----
(alice:Customer:HighValueCustomer)

(apple:Company:PublicCompany)
----

[.transcript-only]
====
[TIP]
.Use nouns for labels
=====
Nodes typically represent things, and should be given a singular noun label. For example, `Customer`, `Account`, `Transaction`.
=====
====

[.slide.col-2]
== Relationships

[.col]
====
*Relationships* are the lines in the graph.
Relationships describe how nodes within the graph are connected to each other.

A relationship in Neo4j connects two nodes, referred to as the **start** and **end** nodes.

All relationships have:

* a *type* - `HAS_ACCOUNT`, `LIVES_IN`.
* a *direction* - Alice `HAS_ACCOUNT` Account-1234, Account-1234 doesn't have Alice.
====

[.col]
----
(Alice)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(Account-1234)
         
(Alice)-[:LIVES_IN]->(New York)
----

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== Relationships

[.col]
====
Nodes can have multiple relationships to other nodes.

Multiple relationships can be used to describe bi-directional relationships.
====

[.col]
----
(Account-1234)-[:TRANSACTION]->(Account-5678)
              
(Account-5678)-[:TRANSACTION]->(Account-1234)
----

[.transcript-only]
====
[TIP]
.Use verbs for relationship types
=====
You can use a relationship to represent: 

* A financial connection - `Customer HAS_ACCOUNT Account`, `AssetManager HOLDS Company`.
* A fact - `Customer LIVES_IN Location`, `Company FILED Filing`, `Customer TRANSACTED_WITH Merchant`.
* A hierarchy - `Company SUBSIDIARY_OF Parent`, `Account LINKED_TO Account`.
* Any type of connection between 2 entities - `Entity RELATED_TO Entity`.
=====
====

[.slide.col-2]
== Properties

[.col]
====
You can store data against nodes and relationships as properties.

Properties are named key, value pairs; for example _name_, _balance_, and _amount_.

Nodes and relationships can have any number of properties, and those of the same type do not have to have the same properties (i.e. Neo4j is schemaless).

Properties have a type (integer, boolean, string, list, etc) and can be unique identifiers (keys) for specific node labels.

(alice:Customer {
  name: "Alice Johnson",
  email: "alice@email.com",
  age: 32

-[:TRANSACTION {
  amount: 1500.00,
  date: "2024-01-15",
  type: "transfer"
}]->

== Why Graphs for Financial Data?

Graph databases excel in financial applications because they:

* **Preserve Relationships**: Maintain connections between customers, accounts, and transactions
* **Enable Pattern Detection**: Identify fraud patterns and risk factors through relationship analysis
* **Support Real-time Analysis**: Fast traversal for immediate fraud detection
* **Facilitate Compliance**: Track money flows and regulatory relationships
* **Enhance AI Applications**: Provide rich context for machine learning models

[.slide.col-2]
== Financial Graph Examples

[.col]
====
**Fraud Detection**:
* Unusual transaction patterns
* Account networks and money flows
* Customer behavior analysis

**Risk Assessment**:
* Portfolio concentration analysis
* Counterparty risk evaluation
* Systemic risk identification
====

[.col]
====
**Customer 360**:
* Complete customer relationship view
* Product recommendations
* Cross-selling opportunities

**Regulatory Compliance**:
* Anti-money laundering (AML)
* Know Your Customer (KYC)
* Beneficial ownership tracking

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned that Neo4j stores and organizes data as a graph using nodes, labels, relationships, and properties.

You also learned how graphs are particularly powerful for financial applications that need to understand complex relationships between customers, accounts, transactions, and other financial entities.

In the next lesson, you will learn about Neo4j's platform and ecosystem.
