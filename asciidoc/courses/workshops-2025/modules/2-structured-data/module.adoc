:order: 2
:type: module
:duration: 75 minutes

== Module Overview

This module focuses on importing, modeling, and working with structured data sources in Neo4j for AI applications through progressive lessons and hands-on practice.

=== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

* Design effective graph data models from relational schemas
* Import structured data using LOAD CSV with proper validation
* Use the visual Data Importer for no-code data import workflows
* Transform and optimize data during import process
* Create performance-optimized graph structures for AI applications

=== Prerequisites

* Completion of Module 1: Graph Basics
* Understanding of CSV/JSON data formats
* Basic SQL knowledge helpful but not required

=== Module Structure

This module consists of 5 progressive lessons:

1. **Graph Data Modeling** (15 min) - Design principles and patterns
2. **CSV Import with LOAD CSV** (20 min) - Data import fundamentals  
3. **Visual Data Importer** (15 min) - No-code import workflows
4. **Data Transformation and Optimization** (15 min) - Advanced techniques
5. **Hands-on Exercise** (10 min) - Complete financial dataset import

=== Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, participants will have:

* Solid understanding of graph data modeling principles
* Practical experience with LOAD CSV import procedures
* Experience with visual Data Importer workflows
* Knowledge of data transformation and validation techniques
* Hands-on experience building AI-ready graph structures
* Performance optimization skills for large-scale imports

== Module Assessment

=== Knowledge Check Questions

1. When should you create a separate node vs. using a property?
2. What's the correct order for creating constraints, indexes, and importing data?
3. When should you use LOAD CSV vs. the visual Data Importer?
4. How do you handle missing values during CSV import?
5. What are the performance implications of relationship direction?

=== Practical Assessment

Participants should demonstrate:
* Designing appropriate graph models from relational schemas
* Writing efficient LOAD CSV statements with validation
* Using the visual Data Importer for no-code workflows
* Creating proper constraints and indexes
* Transforming and cleaning data during import

== Module Summary

This module covered essential skills for working with structured data in Neo4j. Participants learned to think in graphs rather than tables, import data efficiently using both programmatic and visual approaches, and create optimized structures for AI applications.

The techniques learned here - data modeling, LOAD CSV scripting, visual Data Importer workflows, and performance tuning - provide comprehensive skills for working with any type of structured data in graph databases.
