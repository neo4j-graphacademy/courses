== Creating Financial Graph Nodes

To create nodes in Neo4j using Data Importer, you will need to:

. Connect to a Neo4j database
. Upload a CSV file
. Create a node
. Map properties from the CSV file to the node
. Run the import

=== Connect to your sandbox

A Neo4j sandbox was created for you when you enrolled on this course.
You can connect the Neo4j Data Importer to your sandbox to import data.

. Open the link:https://workspace.neo4j.io/workspace/import[Import tab in Neo4j Workspace^] at link:https://workspace.neo4j.io/workspace/import[https://workspace.neo4j.io].
. Select the `Connect` button from the connection menu to connect to your sandbox.
+

.Need to clear an existing model?
====
If you have an existing data importer model, you can clear it by selecting the `Clear all` option from the menu `...`.

image::images/clear-model-annotated.png[The clear all option in the data importer menu '...']
====

Any data import you run will be against the connected Neo4j database.

=== Upload a financial dataset file

Data Importer can import data from CSV (Comma Separated Values) and TSV (Tab Separated Values) files.

You need to upload the file to Data Importer before importing from it.

All the link:https://data.neo4j.com/workshops-2025/financial-data.zip[CSV source files^] you need for this course are available to download.

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/workshops-2025/customers.csv[`customers.csv`^] file contains data about financial customers and their accounts.
You will use Data Importer to import this data and create `Customer` nodes.

. Download the link:https://data.neo4j.com/workshops-2025/customers.csv[`customers.csv`^] file.
. Upload the `customers.csv` file to Data Importer using the `Files` panel.
+
image::images/upload-file.png[The files panel in data importer]
. Once uploaded, the file and its contents will be displayed.
+
image::images/customers-file-contents.png[The file contents in data importer]

The `customers.csv` file contains fields such as `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `registration_date`, and `credit_score`.

You will use the data in this file to create `Customer` nodes and their properties.

[.slide]
== Sample Financial Data Structure

[.slide.discrete]
=== Customer CSV Structure

```csv
customer_id,name,email,registration_date,credit_score,account_type
CUST-001,Jennifer Martinez,jennifer.martinez@email.com,2023-01-15,742,Premium
CUST-002,Robert Chen,robert.chen@email.com,2023-02-20,685,Standard
CUST-003,Sarah Johnson,sarah.johnson@email.com,2023-03-10,698,Premium
```

[.slide.discrete]
=== Account CSV Structure

```csv
account_id,customer_id,account_type,balance,open_date,status
ACC-001,CUST-001,Checking,15420.50,2023-01-16,Active
ACC-002,CUST-001,Savings,45890.25,2023-01-16,Active
ACC-003,CUST-002,Checking,3240.75,2023-02-21,Active
```

=== Create a Customer node

To create new nodes in Data Importer you must create a new node label, before mapping the fields from the CSV file to node properties.

. Add a new node label.
+
image::images/add-node-annotated.png[The add node button in data importer]
. Label the node as `Customer` in the `Definition` panel.
. The `customers.csv` file should be automatically selected.
+
image::images/customer-label-annotated.png[The node label box in data importer]
. To import data from the file, you must map the fields in the CSV file to properties on the `Customer` node. Click the `Map from file` button.
+
image::images/map-from-file-annotated.png[The Map from file highlighted]
. You can then choose which fields from the CSV file to map to the node properties.
Click `Select all` to map all the fields and `Confirm`.
+
image::images/map-customer-properties-annotated.png[The map from file dialog showing the customer fields to map, with select all highlighted]
+
The fields from the CSV file will be added as properties to the `Customer` node.
+
image::images/mapped-customer-properties.png[The customer fields are added as properties to the Customer node in the properties panel]

Data importer creates a `Name` for each property and assigns a `Type` based on the data in the file. The `Column` refers to the field in the CSV file.

=== Update Customer Properties

You can modify the properties before running the import.

It is good practice to check the data types and, depending on the source data, update the names of the properties.

You should update some of the property names to follow graph conventions:

[caption=]
.Update property names
|===
| From | To

| `customer_id` | `customerId`
| `registration_date` | `registrationDate`
| `credit_score` | `creditScore`
| `account_type` | `accountType`

|===

You can rename the properties by selecting the property name and typing the new name.

image::images/edit-customer-property-name-annotated.png[The property name being edited in the properties panel]

You must also assign a property as the node's unique identifier (ID).

You can use the `customerId` as the unique identifier for the `Customer` nodes.
To set the unique identifier, click the _key_ icon next to the `customerId` property.

image::images/set-customer-id-annotated.png[The key icon next to the customerId property in the properties panel]

Once the properties are updated and a unique ID set, you can run the import and create the `Customer` nodes from data in the `customers.csv` file.

[.slide]
== Data Type Mapping

[.slide.discrete]
=== Automatic Type Detection

Data Importer automatically detects data types:

* **String**: Names, emails, addresses
* **Integer**: Customer IDs, credit scores  
* **Float**: Account balances, transaction amounts
* **Date**: Registration dates, transaction timestamps
* **Boolean**: Account status flags

[.slide.discrete]
=== Financial Data Considerations

* Use **Integer** for credit scores (numerical analysis)
* Use **Float** for monetary amounts (precision)
* Use **Date** for temporal queries
* Use **String** for identifiers that won't be calculated

=== Run the import

Click the `Run import` button to create the `Customer` nodes.

image::images/run-import-annotated.png[The run import button in data importer]

Using your configuration, Data importer will load the data from the CSV file and create the data in the Neo4j database.

Once complete, you will see an import summary, including counts of the nodes created and properties set.

image::images/customer-import-summary.png[The import summary in data importer showing customer nodes created]

Click `Close` to return to Data Importer.

You can modify the import configuration and rerun the import multiple times.

=== Create Account nodes and relationships

Now let's import the accounts data and create relationships to customers:

. Upload the link:https://data.neo4j.com/workshops-2025/accounts.csv[`accounts.csv`^] file.
. Create an `Account` node with properties: `accountId`, `accountType`, `balance`, `openDate`, `status`.
. Set `accountId` as the unique identifier.
. Create a relationship `HAS_ACCOUNT` from `Customer` to `Account` by matching `customer_id` fields.

[.slide]
== Creating Relationships

[.slide.discrete]
=== Relationship Mapping Process

1. **Upload related data files** (accounts.csv)
2. **Create target node** (Account)
3. **Map properties** from CSV columns
4. **Define relationship type** (HAS_ACCOUNT)
5. **Match on common fields** (customer_id)

[.slide.discrete]
=== Financial Relationship Patterns

```cypher
(Customer)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(Account)
(Customer)-[:MADE_TRANSACTION]->(Transaction)
(Account)-[:TRANSACTION_FROM]->(Account)
(AssetManager)-[:HOLDS]->(Company)
```

== View the imported data

You can view the data in Neo4j using this Cypher, which returns customers and their accounts:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(a:Account) 
RETURN c, a 
LIMIT 25
----

[TIP]
.Backup your work
====
Data Importer saves changes automatically, but you can download your import model and data by selecting the `Download model (with data)` option from the menu `...`.

image::images/download-model-data-annotated.png[The download model (with data) option in the data importer menu '...']

You can restore your model using the `Open model (with data)` option and selecting the downloaded file.
