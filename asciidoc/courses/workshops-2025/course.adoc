== Course Description

The 2025 Modular GenAI Workshop system provides a flexible, maintainable approach to Neo4j GenAI education. 

This modular system allows teams to mix-and-match components for customized workshop experiences:

* **Modular & Maintainable**: Update once, used everywhere
* **DevRel-owned**: Each module has a clear maintainer - DevRel Alison Cossette
* **Centralized Library**: All modules live in one location for easy access
* **Consistent Experience**: Unified tone, structure, and quality
* **Flexible Delivery**: Teams can mix-and-match for any class
* **Shared Tooling**: Standardized environments, templates, and CI/CD
* **Measurable Impact**: Track usage and improve at the module level

=== Workshop Modules

The system consists of 6 core modules that can be combined for different audiences:

1. **Graph Basics** - Fundamental graph concepts and Neo4j introduction
2. **Structured Data** - Working with structured data in graphs
3. **Unstructured Data** - Processing and importing unstructured content
4. **Graph Analytics** - Graph Data Science and analytics workflows
5. **Retrievers** - Implementing retrieval patterns for RAG
6. **Agents** - Building agentic systems with graph knowledge

=== Toolbox Configuration

**BASIC/ADVANCED Toolbox**
* **Environment**: Graph Academy / Codespaces (notebooks)
* **Dataset**: Financial Dataset
* **Features**: Graph Analytics + Agentic Modules
* **Infrastructure**: Sandbox â†’ Aura

=== Prerequisites

Before taking these workshops, participants should have:

* Basic understanding of data concepts
* Familiarity with Python (for coding modules)
* Access to Graph Academy and Codespaces

=== Target Audiences

* **Developers**: Application development focus
