== Course Description

In this course, we walk through the steps to integrate Neo4j into your Python projects.

We will follow the steps to create an instance of the Neo4j Python Driver, learn about sessions and transactions, and use that knowledge to build a REST API with link:https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/[Flask^].

The project also serves a pre-built Single Page Application (SPA) that calls the API.
As you work through the course, you will replace the hardcoded API responses with data from Neo4j.

The course automatically creates a new `recommendations` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.

By the end of this course, you will have gained a solid understanding of how to use Neo4j in a Python application to build a practical and robust API.
You will be able to use your newfound knowledge to create your own Neo4j-backed APIs.
So, get ready to dive into the world of graph databases and Python!

=== Prerequisites

By taking this course, we assume that you have a working knowledge of Python and PIP.
We also assume that you have at least a basic knowledge of Neo4j.

If you haven't already done so, we recommend that you also take the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals] course in order to gain a basic understanding of Neo4j and the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals] to understand how to query Neo4j using Cypher.
