This challenge has three parts:

1. <<Adding a Movie to My Favorites>>
2. <<Removing a Movie from My Favorites>>
3. <<Listing My Favorites>>

== The My Favorites Feature

image::images/movie-cards.png[Add a Movie to your Favorites, role=right]

Clicking the link:http://localhost:3000/favorites[My Favorites^] link in the main navigation will take you to page which contains a list of Movies that you can revisit later.

When a logged in user hovers their mouse cursor over a Movie on the website, a bookmark icon appears in the top right hand corner.
Clicking this icon will either add or remove the Movie from the user's Favorites list.

When adding a Movie to the list, a  `POST` request it sent to the `/api/favorites/{id}` endpoint.  When this happens, the following chain of events will occur:

1. The server directs the request to the route handler in link:{repository-blob}/main/api/routes/account.py[`api/routes/account.py`^], which verifies the user's JWT token before handling the request
2. The route handler creates an instance of the link:{repository-blob}/main/api/dao/favorites.py[`FavoriteDAO`^].
3. The `add()` method is then called on the `FavoriteDAO` instance with the user's ID taken from the JWT token, and the ID of the movie that has been extracted from the request URL.
4. It is then the responsibility of the `FavoriteDAO` to find the `:User` and `:Movie` nodes and create the `:HAS_FAVORITE` relationship between them.

Likewise, when it is clicked for a Movie that has already been favorited, a `DELETE` request is sent to the same URL, and the Movie is removed from the list.

// When adding a Movie to a User's Favorite list, a relationship is created between the `:User` and `:Movie` with the type `:HAS_FAVORITE`.


== Adding a Movie to My Favorites

For the first part of this challenge, modify the `add()` method to open a new database session, run the Cypher statement to create the `:HAS_FAVORITE` relationship, close the session and return the movie details along with an additional `favorite` property.

Open `{lab-filename}`

=== 1. Define a new Transaction Function

Define a new transaction function to execute the Cypher statement below to create the `:HAS_FAVORITE` relationship between the User and the Movie.

----

The function should expect a transaction object as the first parameter and also accept the `user_id` and `movie_id` as named parameters to the function.

There should only be one result, so you can call the `single()` method to instantly consume the first result.

If no records are returned, you can safely assume that the either the User or Movie do not exist.
In this case, raise a `NotFoundException` with an appropriate error message.

Otherwise, use the `get()` method on the record to return the `movie` value from the first row.

=== 2. Call the Transaction Function

In a new session, call the new method in a new Write Transaction and return the results.

== Removing a Movie from My Favorites

The second part of this challenge is to write the code to remove a movie from the My Favorites list.

The code for deleting the `:HAS_FAVORITE` relationship will be similar, only the Cypher statement will change.

Instead of two separate `MATCH` clauses, we can instead attempt to find the pattern within a single clause.
If the relationship (with an alias of `r`) exists, we will delete it and then return the movie information with `favorite` set to `false`.

Use the code from the `add()` method above to implement the `remove()` function.
If you get stuck, you can reveal the completed method below.

== Listing My Favorites

Finally, the `all()` method in the `FavoriteDAO` currently returns a hardcoded list of Movies.

.api/dao/favorites.py
[source,python,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/api/dao/favorites.py[tag=all]
----

Update this method to return a paginated list of movies that the user has added to their My Favorites list.

This time, as the query is simpler, you can use a lambda function to represent the transaction function.

[NOTE]
.Escaped Braces
====
You may have noticed that the code block above features double curly braces (`{{` and `}}`) within the `MATCH` clause rather than the single braces used within the Cypher statement.

`MATCH (u:User {{userId: $userId}})`

Braces need to be escaped within a Python string, and we do this by using double quotes.

[.summary]
== Module Summary

In this Challenge, you have written the code to find or create a `:HAS_FAVORITE` relationship between a `User` and a `Movie` within a write transaction.

In the next Challenge, you will write code to execute multiple queries in the same transaction.
