The challenges in this course come thick and fast!

In this challenge, you will modify the `add()` method in the link:{repository-blob}/main/api/dao/ratings.py[`RatingDTO`^] to save ratings into Neo4j.

== The Request Lifecycle

image::images/rating-form.png[Rating a Movie, role=right]

Before we start, let's take a look at the request lifecycle when saving a review.
If you prefer, you can skip to <<Saving a Rating>>.

On every Movie page, the user is invited to rate a movie on scale of 1 to 5.
The form pictured to the right gives the user the ability to select a rating between 1 and 5 and click submit to save the rating.

When the form is submitted, the website sends a request to `/api/account/ratings/{movieId}` and the following will happen:

1. The server directs the request to the route handler in link:{repository-blob}/main/api/routes/account.py[`api/routes/account.py`^], which verifies the user's JWT token before handling the request.
2. The route handler creates an instance of the link:{repository-blob}/main/api/dao/ratings.py[`RatingDAO`^].
3. The `add()` method is called on the `RatingDAO`, and is passed the ID of the current user, the ID of the movie and a rating from the request body.
4. It is then the responsibility of the `add()` method to save this information to the database and return an appropriate response.

A rating is represented in the graph a relationship going from a `:User` to a `:Movie` node with the type `:RATED`.  The relationship has two properties; the rating (an integer) and a timestamp to represent when the relationship was created.

After the data is saved, the UI expects the movie details to be returned, with an additional property called `rating`, which will be the rating that the user has given for the movie.

Let's take a look at the existing method in the `RatingDAO`.

Your challenge is to replace the `TODO` comments in this method with working code.


== Saving a Rating

Complete the following steps to complete the challenge:

1. <<Define a Transaction Function>>
2. <<Run the Function in a Write Transaction>>
3. <<Check User and Movie Exist>>
4. <<Return the Results>>


lab::Open `{lab-filename}`[]

=== Define a Transaction Function

The first step is to define a new transaction function.
The function should call the `run()` method on the transaction object passed as the first parameter, using the additional parameters passed to the function as named parameters.

The query should only ever return a single row, so the `single()` method can be called to instantly consume and return the first row.

[TIP]
By using the `MERGE` keyword here, we will overwrite an existing rating if one already exists.
This way we don't need to worry about duplicates or deleting existing records.


=== Run the Function in a Write Transaction

Within a new database session, call the `create_rating()` function, passing the three parameters passed to the method: `user_id`, `movie_id` and `rating`.

=== Check User and Movie Exist

As the transaction function calls the `single()` method, the returned value will be either a `Record` or `None`.

If the returned value is `None`, either the `User` or `Movie` could not be found, raise a `NotFoundException`.
This will be handled by a Flask middleware.

=== Return the Results


Otherwise, use the brackets method to extract the `movie` value from the record and return it.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you have updated the `RatingDAO` to save a relationship between a User and Movie to represent a Rating.

In the next Challenge, you will implement the My Favorites feature.
