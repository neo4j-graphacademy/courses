= Sessions and Transactions
:type: quiz

== Sessions

Through the Driver, we open **Sessions**.

> A session is a container for a sequence of transactions.
> Sessions borrow connections from a pool as required and are considered lightweight and disposable.

It is important to remember that sessions are not the same as database connections.
When the Driver connects to the database, it opens up multiple TCP connections that can be borrowed by the session.
A query may be sent over multiple connections, and results may be received by the driver over multiple connections.

Instead, sessions should be considered a client-side abstraction for grouping units of work, which also handle the underlying connections.
The connections themselves are managed internally by the driver and are not directly exposed to the application.

To open a new session, call the `session()` method on the driver.

.Open a new Session
[source,python,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag="driver.session",indent=0]
----

This session method takes an optional configuration argument, which can be used to set the database to run any queries against in a multi-database setup, and the default access mode for any queries run within the transaction.

.Open a new Session with additional arguments
[source,python,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag=sessionWithArgs,indent=0]
----

If no database is supplied, the default database will be used.  This is configured in the `dbms.default_database` in `neo4j.conf`, the default value is `neo4j`.
You cannot create multiple databases in Neo4j Aura or in Neo4j Community Edition.

For more information on multi-database setup, see link:https://neo4j.com/developer/manage-multiple-databases/[Managing Multiple Databases^].

The default access mode is set to write, but this can be overwritten by explicitly calling the `execute_read()` or `execute_write()` functions.


== Transactions

Through a Session, we can run one or more **Transactions**.

> A transaction comprises a unit of work performed against a database.
> It is treated in a coherent and reliable way, independent of other transactions.


[TIP]
.ACID Transactions
====
// Neo4j uses an **ACID** consistency model to ensure that data is data is safely and consistently stored.
A transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
Many developers are familiar with ACID transactions from their work with relational databases, and as such the ACID consistency model has been the norm for some time.

// The ACID acronym stands for:

// * **Atomic** - All operations in a transaction succeed or every operation is rolled back.
// * **Consistent** - On the completion of a transaction, the database is structurally sound.
// * **Isolated** - Transactions do not contend with one another. Contentious access to data is moderated by the database so that transactions appear to run sequentially.
// * **Durable** - The results of applying a transaction are permanent, even in the presence of failures.
====


There are three types of transaction exposed by the driver:

* Auto-commit Transactions
* Read Transactions
* Write Transactions



=== Auto-commit Transactions

Auto-commit transactions are a single unit of work that are immediately executed against the DBMS and acknowledged immediately.
You can run an auto-commit transaction by calling the `run()` method on the session object, passing in a Cypher statement as a string and optionally an object containing a set of parameters.

[source,python,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag=session.run]
----


[WARNING]
.For one-off queries only
In the event that there are any transient errors when running a query, the driver will not attempt to retry a query when using `session.run()`.
For this reason, these should only be used for one-off queries and shouldn't be used in production.


=== Read Transactions

When you intend to read data from Neo4j, you should execute a **Read** Transaction.
In a clustered environment (including Neo4j Aura), read queries are distributed across the cluster.

The session provides an `execute_read()` function, which expects a single parameter, a function that represents the unit of work.
The first argument passed to the function will be a transaction object, on which you can call the `run()` function to execute a Cypher statement.
As with the `session.run` example above, the first argument for the `run()` function should be a Cypher statement, and any parameters in the Cypher statement should be passed as named parameters.

.Running a Read Transaction
[source,python,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag=session.readTransaction]
----

[TIP]
.Parameterized Queries
In the query above, the the `$` prefix of `$title` (1) indicates that this value relates to the parameter defined in the second argument (2) of the `run()` function call.


You do not need to explicitly commit a read transaction.


=== Write Transactions

If you intend to write data to the database, you should execute a **Write** Transaction.

In clustered environments, write queries are sent exclusively to the _leader_ of the cluster.  The leader of the cluster is then responsible for processing the query and synchronising the transaction across the _followers_ and _read-replica_ servers in the cluster.

The process is identical to running a Read Transaction.

.Running a Write Transaction
[source,python,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag=session.writeTransaction,indent=0]
----

If anything goes wrong within of the unit of work or there is a problem on Neo4j's side, the transaction will be automatically rolled back and the database will remain in its previous state.
If the unit of work succeeds, the transaction will be automatically committed.

[TIP]
Unlike `session.run()`, if a _transient_ error is received by the driver, for example a connectivity issue with the DBMS, the driver will automatically retry the unit of work.



== Manually Creating Transactions

It is also possible to explicitly create a transaction object by calling the `begin_transaction()` function on the session.

.Creating an Manual Transaction
[source,python,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag=session.beginTransaction,indent=0]
----

This returns a Transaction object identical to the one passed in to the unit of work function when calling `execute_read()` or `execute_write()`.

This method differs from the `execute_read` and `execute_write()` functions, in that the transaction will have to be manually committed or rolled back depending on the outcome of the unit of work.

You can commit a transaction by calling the `tx.commit()` function, or roll back the transaction by calling `tx.rollback()`.

include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag=session.beginTransaction.Try]

== Closing the Session

Once you are finished with your session, you  call the `close()` method to release any database connections held by that session.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned about the process of creating sessions and running Cypher queries within transaction functions.

In the next lesson we will look at how we process the results of a query.
