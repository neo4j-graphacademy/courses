[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The following statement will mimic the behaviour of the test by first finding the movie with the highest `.imdbId` rating and merging a new `:User` node into the graph with the email address `graphacademy.flag@neo4j.com`.

The test then merges a `:HAS_FAVORITE` relationship between the user and movie.
