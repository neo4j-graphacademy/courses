= Project Introduction
:order: 0

As part of this course, you will work on a link:https://github.com/{repository}[pre-built repository^] for the fictional client **Neoflix**.
The course is designed to be framework agnostic, so although we have chosen a specific framework, the tasks that you will perform will be the same regardless of your choice of framework.

In the early stages you will learn some of the theory required and then use that knowledge to implement a set of features in the API.


== Repository Information

We have built a repository that takes care of the boiler plate, so you can focus on implementing the functionality.


* The project is designed to work with Python version **3.10**
* Packages can be installed with pip
* A web server has been built with link:https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/[Flask^]
** Authentication is handled with link:https://jwt.io/[JWT Tokens^] and link:https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Flask-JWT-Extended^]
** Passwords are encrypted and verified with link:https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/[bcrypt^]
** Testing is performed using link:https://pytest.org/[pytest^]


== Get Started

In the next lesson, we will explore the project in Gitpod and and introduce you to Neo4j Sandbox.
