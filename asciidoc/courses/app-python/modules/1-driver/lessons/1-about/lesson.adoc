= About the Driver
:type: quiz

In the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] course, we cover how to query Neo4j using a language called Cypher.
To execute a Cypher statement against a Neo4j database you will use an object called a *Driver*.


// tag::driver[]
> The **Driver** object is a thread-safe, application-wide fixture from which all Neo4j interaction derives.
>
> The Driver API is **topology independent**, so you can run the same code against a *Neo4j cluster* or a *single DBMS*.

// end::driver[]

To connect to and query Neo4j from within a Python application, you use the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/python[Neo4j Python Driver^].

The Neo4j Python Driver is one of five officially supported drivers, the others are Java, JavaScript, .NET, and Go.
There are also a wide range of Community Drivers available for other languages including PHP and Ruby.

You should create a **single instance** of the Driver in your application per Neo4j cluster or DBMS, which can then be shared across your application.

== Installing the Driver

The Neo4j Python Driver is available through the pip management system and can be installed with the `pip` command.

[source,shell]
pip install neo4j


== Creating a Driver Instance

Each driver instance will connect to one DBMS, or Neo4j cluster, depending on the value provided in the connection string.

The `neo4j` package exports a `GraphDatabase` object.  This object provides a `driver()` function for creating a new driver instance.

The `driver()` function requires one mandatory parameter, a **connection string** for the Neo4j cluster or DBMS - for example `neo4j://localhost:7687` or `neo4j+s://_dbhash_.databases.neo4j.io:7687`.

Additionally, you will also pass a named parameter `auth` to represent the Neo4j user credentials.
You can provide basic username/password authentication by passing the username and password as a tuple.

Here is an example for how to create a driver instance to connect to a Neo4j instance running on `localhost` on port `7687` with the username `neo4j` and password `neo`:

include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag=driver,indent=0]
----

The above example creates an _unencrypted_ connection to the Neo4j server at `localhost` on the default port number of `7687`.
The driver then attemps to authenticate against the server using a basic authentication with the username `neo4j` and password `neo`.


=== Verifying Connectivity

You can verify that the connection details used during driver instantiation are correct by calling the `verifyConnectivity()` function.
This function will raise a `Neo4jException` with a `code` property of `Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized` if a connection could not be made.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the Neo4j Python Driver and how it can be used to connect to Neo4j from within a Python application.

In the next lesson, we will take a closer look at the first argument in the `GraphDatabase.driver()` function, the connection string.
