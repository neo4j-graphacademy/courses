There are two methods remaining in the link:{repository-blob}/main/api/dao/movies.py[`MovieDAO`^] that are currently returning hardcoded data.

* <<find_by_id>> - should return information about a movie, including a list of actors, director, and genres.
* <<get_similar_movies>> - should return a list of similar movies, ordered by a score generated by Neoflix's recommendation algorithm.

In this challenge, you will update these methods to query Neo4j.

First, let's take a look at how these methods are used.

== Movie Page

If you click on any movie, you'll see that the API currently only returns information about the film _Goodfellas_.

The page itself is populated by three API calls:

1. The details about the movie are loaded via the `api/movies/{id}` endpoint.  This endpoint gets its data from the <<find_by_id>> method.
2. The similar movies list is loaded by a call to the `api/movies/{id}/similar` endpoint, which gets its data from the <<get_similar_movies>> method.
3. The ratings on the right hand side of the page are loaded by a call to the `api/movies/{id}/ratings` endpoint.  You will update this method in the next lesson.


[#find_by_id]
== find_by_id()

Movie information is retrieved by the `find_by_id()` method.

.api/dao/movies.py
[source,python,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/api/dao/movies.py[tag=findById]
----

Most of the important information is held as properties on the `Movie` node, but the payload should also return some additional information.
We can use a Cypher subquery and the `count()` aggregate function to get the number of ratings for the movie and use a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/lists/#cypher-pattern-comprehension[Pattern Comprehension] to get a list of actors and directors.

As with the other movie methods in the `MovieDAO`, we should also provide a `favorite` value to represent whether the user has added this movie to their My Favorites list or not.

The following Cypher statement should be run within a **read transaction**:

.Movie Details
[source,cypher]
----
include::{cypher-repository-raw}/main/cypher/3-backlog/4-movie-view/movie-details.cypher[]
----


=== Your Task

* Modify the `find_by_id()` method to query Neo4j and return details for the requested movie.
* The returned object should include a list of actors, directors, genres, and a boolean flag to represent whether the movie exists on the current user's My Favorites List.
* If no records are returned, the method should raise a `NotFoundException`.

[#get_similar_movies]
== get_similar_movies()

Similar movies are found using the `get_similar_movies()` method.

To provide a simple set of similar movies, the Cypher statement below uses the number of neighbors in common and their IMDB rating to generate a _similarity score_.

The following Cypher statement should be run within a **read transaction**:

.Find Similar Movies

=== Your Task

* Modify the `get_similar_movies()` method to query Neo4j and return a list of similar movies.
* The returned objects should include a list of actors, directors, genres, and a boolean flag to represent whether the movie exists on the current user's My Favorites List.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you modified the `find_by_id()` and `get_similar_movies()` methods to return movie details from the Neo4j database.

In the next Challenge, you will complete the Movie page implementation by retrieving movie ratings from Neo4j.
