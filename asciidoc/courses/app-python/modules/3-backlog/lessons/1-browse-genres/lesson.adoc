If you click on the **Genres** link in the main navigation, you will be taken to a link:http://localhost:3000/genres[list of Genres^].
This list is populated by the API route at http://localhost:3000/api/genres, with the list being produced by the `all()` method within the link:{repository-blob}/main/api/dao/genres.py[`GenreDAO`^].
