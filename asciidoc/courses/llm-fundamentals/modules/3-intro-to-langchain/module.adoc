= Introduction to Langchain
:order: 3

== Module Overview

In the previous modules, you learned the theory behind Neo4j and Large Language Models and used Cypher to query a vector index.

In this module, you will interact with an LLM and Neo4j using link:https://langchain.com/[Langchain^] and Python.

You will learn:

* How to initialize an LLM
* How to create chains and agents
* How to use conversational memory to maintain context
* How to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies, including:
** Using prompts to provide instructions and context
** Using Neo4j vectors to query a graph database
