.LCEL
====
LLMs implement the link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/interface[Runnable interface^], the basic building block of the _LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)_. This means they support `invoke`, `stream` and `batch` for synchronous calls and `ainvoke`, `astream` and `abatch` for asynchronous calls.

You can link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/interface[learn more in the Interface documentation^].
