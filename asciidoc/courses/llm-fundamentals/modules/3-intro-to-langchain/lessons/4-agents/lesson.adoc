In this lesson, you will learn how to create an link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents[agent^].

Agents wrap a model and give it access to a set of _tools_. These tools may access additional data sources, APIs, or functionality. The model is used to determine which of the tools to use to complete a task.

The agent you will create will be able to chat about movies and search YouTube for movie trailers.

== Tools

A tool is a specific abstraction around a function that makes it easy for a language model to interact with it. link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools[Langchain provides several tools^] out of the box, and you can create tools to extend the functionality of your agents.

Tools can be grouped into link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/[toolkits^] to solve a particular problem. For example, a toolkit that gets YouTube information - videos, thumbnails, transcripts, views, etc.

You will use the link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/youtube/[YouTubeSearchTool^] to search YouTube for movie trailers.

== Movie trailer agent

Review the following program below, before running it.

[source,python]
----
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.chains.conversation.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain.tools import Tool

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_key="sk-..."
)

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""
    You are a movie expert. You find movies from a genre or plot. 

    ChatHistory:{chat_history} 
    Question:{input}
    """, 
    input_variables=["chat_history", "input"]
    )

memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

chat_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, memory=memory)

tools = [
    Tool.from_function(
        name="ChatOpenAI",
        description="For when you need to chat about movies. The question will be a string. Return a string.",
        func=chat_chain.run,
        return_direct=True
    )
]

agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, memory=memory,
    agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION
)

while True:
    q = input(">")
    print(agent.run(q))

    Find a movie where aliens land on earth.

    _Sure, I can help you with that. One movie I would recommend where aliens land on Earth is "Arrival" (2016). It's a science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve. The story follows a linguist who is recruited by the military to help communicate with an alien species that has landed on Earth. It's a thought-provoking and visually stunning movie that explores themes of communication, time, and the human experience. I hope you enjoy it!_

Based on your understanding from previous lessons you should be able to identify the following:

. A chat model is being used to have a conversation about movies
. The prompt which sets the context for the LLM and the input variables
. That memory is used to store the conversation history
. A chain is created to link the chat model, prompt, and memory together

In addition to the above, the following is new:

. A tool is created using the chain
+
[source,python]
----
tools = [
    Tool.from_function(
        name="ChatOpenAI",
        description="For when you need to chat about movies. The question will be a string. Return a string.",
        func=chat_chain.run,
        return_direct=True
    )
]
----
. An agent is initialized that uses the tool
+
[source, python]
----
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, memory=memory,
    agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION
)
----

### Creating tools

Tools are interfaces that an agent can interact with. You can link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/custom_tools[create custom tools^] able to perform any functionality you want.

In this example, the Tool is created from a function. The function is the `chat_chain.run` method.

[source, python]
----
tools = [
    Tool.from_function(
        name="ChatOpenAI",
        description="For when you need to chat about movies. The question will be a string. Return a string.",
        func=chat_chain.run,
        return_direct=True
    )
]
----

The `name` and `description` help the LLM select the tool to use when presented with a question. The `func` parameter is the function that will be called when the tool is used. The `return_direct` flag indicates that the tool will return the result directly.

Agents support multiple tools, so you pass them to the agent as a list (`tools`).

### Initializing an agent

The following code initializes the agent:

[source, python]
----
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, memory=memory,
    agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION
)
----

The agent is initialized by passing:

* the `tools` to use
* the `llm` which will manage the interactions and decide which tool to use
* the `memory` which will store the conversation history
* the link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/[`agent` type^] to be used. In this case, the `CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION` (_ReAct_ - Reasoning and Acting) agent type.

[TIP]
.Agent initialization parameters
====
You may find the following additional parameters useful when initializing an agent:

* `max_iterations` - the maximum number of iterations to run the LLM for. This is useful in preventing the LLM from running for too long or entering an infinite loop.
* `verbose` - if `True` the agent will print out the LLM output and the tool output.
* `handle_parsing_errors` - if `True` the agent will handle parsing errors and return a message to the user.

[source, python]
----
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, memory=memory,
    agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    max_iterations=3, 
    verbose=True, 
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
)
----

=== Multiple tools

A key advantage of using an agent is that they can use multiple tools. This allows you to create agents that can perform multiple tasks.

You can extend this example to allow it to search YouTube for movie trailers by adding the link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/youtube/[YouTubeSearchTool^] to the `tools` list. 

Firsly, you will need to install the link:https://pypi.org/project/youtube-search/[`youtube-search`^] package.

[source, bash]
----
pip install youtube-search
----

Import the `YouTubeSearchTool` and create a new tool.

[source, python]
----
from langchain.tools import Tool, YouTubeSearchTool

tools = [
    Tool.from_function(
        name="ChatOpenAI",
        description="For when you need to chat about movies, genres or plots. The question will be a string. Return a string.",
        func=chat_chain.run,
        return_direct=True
    ),
    Tool.from_function(
        name="YouTubeSearchTool",
        description="For when you need a link to a movie trailer. The question will be a string. Return a link to a YouTube video.",
        func=youtube.run,
        return_direct=True
    )
]
----

The model will then use the `name` and `description` for each tool to decide which tool to use.

When prompted to find a movie trailer, the model should use the `YouTubeSearchTool` tool.

    Find the movie trailer for the Matrix.

    _['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKQi3bBA1y8&pp=ygUUTWF0cml4IG1vdmllIHRyYWlsZXI%3D', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ix7TUGVYIo&pp=ygUUTWF0cml4IG1vdmllIHRyYWlsZXI%3D']_

However, when asked about movies, genres or plots, the model will use the `chat_chain` tool.

    Find a movie about the meaning of life

    _Certainly! One movie that explores the meaning of life is "The Tree of Life" directed by Terrence Malick. It follows the journey of a young boy as he grows up in the 1950s and reflects on his experiences and the meaning of existence. It's a visually stunning and thought-provoking film that delves into existential questions._

As the agent also uses the conversation memory you can refer back to the previous questions, such as finding a trailer for a movie it has recommended:

    Can you find the trailer

    _['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrAz1YLh8nY&pp=ygUeVGhlIFRyZWUgb2YgTGlmZSBtb3ZpZSB0cmFpbGVy', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKqqboXuvyE&pp=ygUeVGhlIFRyZWUgb2YgTGlmZSBtb3ZpZSB0cmFpbGVy']_

Agents and tools allow you to create more adaptable and flexible models to perform multiple tasks.
