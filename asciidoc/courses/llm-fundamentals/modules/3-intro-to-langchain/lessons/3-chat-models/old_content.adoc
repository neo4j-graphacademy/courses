== Wrappinng in a Chain

* A `QAChain` is a type of chain that brings together multiple components to answer questions.
* The main components of a QA chain are:
** Question Parser: Analyzes the input question to extract key information.
** Retriever: Retrieves relevant documents or passages from a corpus based on the question. This is often done using semantic search and vector embeddings.
** Reader: Reads and comprehends the retrieved documents/passages to identify the answer. A machine reading model like a Transformer is commonly used.
** Response Generator: Formulates a natural language response based on the answer extracted by the reader.

=== Adding Memory

[source,python]
----
from langchain.chains.conversation.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory


memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(
    memory_key='chat_history',
    k=5,
    return_messages=True
)
----

* k = keep five messages
