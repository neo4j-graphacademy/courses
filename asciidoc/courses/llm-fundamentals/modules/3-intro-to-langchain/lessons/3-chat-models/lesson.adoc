= Chat Models
:order: 4
:type: lesson

In the previous lesson, you learned how to communicate with the OpenAI LLM using Langchain.

The communication was simple, you provided a prompt and got a response.

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a chat model to _have a conversation_ with the LLM.

== Chat Models vs Language Models

Until now, you have been using a language model to communicate with the LLM. A language model predicts the next word in a sequence of words. Chat models are designed to have conversations - they accept a list of messages and return a conversational response.

[TIP]
.ChatGPT vs GPT-4
====
You may find it helpful to visualize the difference between link:https://chat.openai.com/[ChatGPT] and the GPT-4 language model.

ChatGPT is a chat model built on top of the GPT-4 language model.
====

Chat models typically support different types of messages:

* System - System messages instruct the LLM on how to act on human messages
* Human - Human messages are messages sent from the user
* AI - Responses from the AI are called AI Responses

// TODO - * Chat models can be used as language models, language models cannot be used as chat models? **Verify**

== Create a Chat Model

You are going to create an application that uses a chat model. 

The application will:

* Use a system message to provide instructions
* Use a human message to ask a question
* Receive an AI response to the question

Create a new Python program, import the required LangChain modules and instantiate the chat model.

[IMPORTANT]
Remember to update the API key with your own.

[source,python]
----
from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

chat_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_key="sk-..."
)
----

Create a system message to provide instructions to the chat model using the `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` class.

[source,python]
----
instructions = SystemMessage(content="""
You are a surfer dude, having a conversation about the surf conditions on the beach.
Respond using surfer slang.
""")
----

Create a human message to ask a question.

[source,python]
question = HumanMessage(content="What is the weather like?")

You can now call the chat model passing a list of messages. In this example, pass the system message with the instructions and the human message with the question.

[source,python]
----
response = chat_llm([
    instructions,
    question
] )

print(response.content)
----

[source,python]
----
from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

chat_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_key="sk-..."
)

instructions = SystemMessage(content="""
You are a surfer dude, having a conversation about the surf conditions on the beach.
Respond using surfer slang.
""")

question = HumanMessage(content="What is the weather like?")

response = chat_llm([
    instructions,
    question
])

print(response.content)
----
====

The response is an `AIMessage` object.

[source,python]
AIMessage(content="Dude, the weather is totally gnarly! It's sunny with some epic offshore winds. Perfect conditions for shredding some sick waves!", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)

// TODO - I dont think we need this section anymore
// You can also create messages using templates.

// In this example, a 2nd system message is created using a template and passed in the list of messages to the chat model.

// [source,python]
// ----
// from langchain.prompts import SystemMessagePromptTemplate

// introduction = SystemMessagePromptTemplate(content="Your name is {name}. You always introduce yourself.")

// response = chat_llm([
//     instructions,
//     introduction.format(location="Bob"),
//     question
// ] )
// ----

=== Wrapping in a Chain

Taking what you have learned during this module about prompts and chains, you can create a resuable chat model chain.

Rather than passing a list of messages to the chat model, you can create a prompt that gives context to the conversation and then pass the question to the chat model.

Review this program and identify the following:

* The prompt provides the instructions to the LLM.
* The chain is created using the chat model and the prompt.
* The question is passed to the chat model, when the chain is run.

[source,python]
----
from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

chat_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_key="sk-..."
)

prompt = PromptTemplate(template="""You are a surfer dude, having a conversation about the surf conditions on the beach.
Respond using surfer slang.

Question: {question}
""", input_variables=["question"])

chat_chain = LLMChain(llm=chat_llm, prompt=prompt)

response = chat_chain.run(
    question="What is the weather like?"
)

print(response)
----

Creating a chain is the first step to creating a more sophisticated chat model. You can use chains to piece different elements together into one call and support more complex features.

=== Giving context

Previously, you learned about grounding and how it can provide context to the LLM and avoid _Hallucination_.

Currently the chat model is not grounded; it is unaware of surf conditions on the beach. It responds based on the question and the LLMs training data (which could be months or years out of date).

You can ground the chat model by providing information about the surf conditions on the beach.

Review this example where the chat model can access current beach conditions (`current_weather`) as a variable (`context`) in the prompt.

[source,python]
----
from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

chat_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_key="sk-..."
)

prompt = PromptTemplate(template="""You are a surfer dude, having a conversation about the surf conditions on the beach.
Respond using surfer slang.

Context: {context}
Question: {question}
""", input_variables=["context", "question"])

chat_chain = LLMChain(llm=chat_llm, prompt=prompt)

current_weather = """
    {
        "surf": [
            {"beach": "Fistral", "conditions": "6ft waves and offshore winds"},
            {"beach": "Polzeath", "conditions": "Flat and calm"},
            {"beach": "Watergate Bay", "conditions": "3ft waves and onshore winds"}
        ]
    }"""

response = chat_chain.run(
    context=current_weather,
    question="What is the weather like on Watergate Bay?"
)

print(response)
----

Run the program and predict what the response will be.

Investigate what happens when you change the context by adding additional beach conditions.

Providing context is one aspect of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this lesson you _manually_ gave the model context, however you could have retrieved real-time information from an API or database.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned that chat models are designed for conversations and how to add additional context.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to give your chat model a memory so it can retain information between questions.
