= Improving Semantic Search

// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRD09ndyJNs

So far in this module, you have learned about the benefits and drawbacks of Semantic Search using an underlying vector index.

As you may have noticed from the previous challenge, we received an answer from the vector index but it is difficult to tell whether that is the best movie in the database.


* you rely on the model to provide a good similarity
* two movies about a character named Jack may be considered by the model to be similar to each other when compared to a, say, vanilla yoghurt, but Jack and the Beanstalk and The Shining are two completely different movies.



* Get the results from the index, use previous responses to similar questions and feedback to determine whether documents will provide the answer.  but this is time consuming, and many children may be scared in the process.

* Improving semantic search with graph features
* Improve explainability with paths in the graph
