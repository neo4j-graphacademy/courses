= Fine-Tuning LLMs with Neo4j

In this lesson, we will dive deeper into the concept of fine-tuning in Generative AI and explore how we can fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) using Neo4j. Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained LLM is further trained on specific data to improve its performance on a particular task.

When it comes to Neo4j, fine-tuning LLMs involves leveraging the power of the graph database to tailor the LLM to a specific enterprise or use case. This can be achieved by providing additional training data to the LLM and incorporating the knowledge and structure of the Neo4j knowledge graph.

One of the key benefits of fine-tuning LLMs with Neo4j is improved accuracy. By incorporating the information stored in the knowledge graph, the LLM can gain a better understanding of the context in which it is operating. This contextual understanding allows the LLM to generate more accurate and relevant responses or recommendations.

Another advantage of fine-tuning LLMs with Neo4j is the ability to leverage the rich information stored in the knowledge graph. Neo4j provides a flexible and powerful way to represent complex relationships and connections between entities. By incorporating this knowledge into the LLM, we can enhance its ability to generate meaningful and contextually relevant outputs.

However, there are also challenges associated with fine-tuning LLMs with Neo4j. One challenge is the need for domain-specific training data. Fine-tuning requires data that is specific to the task or domain we want the LLM to perform well in. This means that we need to gather or create a dataset that is relevant to our use case and aligns with the structure of the Neo4j knowledge graph.

Another challenge is the potential for overfitting or bias in the fine-tuned model. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Bias can also be introduced if the training data is not representative of the real-world population or if there are inherent biases in the data itself. It is important to carefully curate and validate the training data to mitigate these challenges.

In conclusion, fine-tuning LLMs with Neo4j can greatly enhance the performance and applicability of Generative AI systems in various domains. By leveraging the power of the graph database, we can improve accuracy, contextual understanding, and leverage the rich information stored in the knowledge graph. However, it is important to be mindful of the challenges associated with fine-tuning, such as the need for domain-specific training data and the potential for overfitting or bias. With careful consideration and proper training data, we can create powerful and effective Generative AI systems that can provide valuable insights and recommendations based on the data stored in a Neo4j database.


// = Avoiding Hallucination

// The problem with LLMs

// * Large language models have the tendency to generate incorrect, nonsensical or unreal results.
// * they appear to answer questions confidently even if they don't have the facts
// * They may provide contradicting or inconsistent responses to similar prompts


// They also have other limitations:

// * Knowledge cut-off =
// * Lack of knowledge of enterprise/domain knowledge


// == Helping LLMs do better

// This is where databases come in, and knowledge graphs are a great fit.


// * Vector embeddings and searches provide similarity but not context
// * A vector that represents an article may be similar to a
