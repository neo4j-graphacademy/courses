:key-points: Neo4j and Generative AI, Grounding LLMs with Neo4j, Using Neo4j with Langchain

== Course Description

In this course, you will learn how to integrate Neo4j with Generative AI models using link:https://www.langchain.com/[Langchain^].

You will learn why graph databases are a reliable option for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), using Neo4j to provide factual, reliable information to stop the LLM from providing unfactual data, also known as *hallucination*.

We will use link:https://www.langchain.com/[Langchain^] because it provides a robust basis for AI application development.
Langchain comes with Neo4j integrations for both Cypher and Neo4j Vector Indexes.
Although this course focuses on link:https://openai.com/[GPT-4 by OpenAI^], you can easily swap this out for the LLM of your choice.


=== Prerequisites

We assume that by taking this course you have a basic understanding of Graph Databases and Neo4j.  If you have not already done so, we recommend taking the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^] course.

We assume a basic understanding of Python.
It is not necessary, but you may also benefit from taking the link:/courses/app-python/[Building Neo4j Applications with Python^] course to understand how the Neo4j Python Driver works.
