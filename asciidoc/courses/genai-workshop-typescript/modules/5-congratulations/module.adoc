Congratulations on completing the GenAI Workshop with TypeScript! You've successfully built a conference chatbot using LangChain and Neo4j, learning how to integrate large language models with graph databases.

In this workshop, you've learned:

* How to set up a TypeScript project with Neo4j and LangChain
* How to use Neo4j as a knowledge graph for RAG applications
* How to write data to Neo4j using LLMs
* How to build LLM applications with proper validation

Phew!  We made it!
