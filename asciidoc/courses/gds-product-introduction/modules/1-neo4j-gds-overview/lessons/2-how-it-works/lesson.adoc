== Introduction

At a high-level, GDS works by transforming and loading data into an in-memory format that is optimized for high-performance graph analytics. GDS provides graph algorithms, feature engineering, and machine learning methods to execute on this in-memory graph format. This enables the efficient and scalable application of data science to large graphs including representations of entire graph databases or large portions of them.

In this lesson we will cover the  high-level workflow in GDS, as well as CPU and memory configuration to support that workflow.

=== General Workflow
Below is diagram illustrating the general workflow in GDS, which breaks out into 3 high-level steps

. *Read and Load the Graph*: GDS needs to read data from the Neo4j database, transform it, and load it into an in-memory graph. In GDS we refer to this process as _projecting a graph_ and refer to the in-memory graph as a _graph projection_. GDS can hold multiple graph projections at once and they are managed by a component called the _Graph Catalog_.  We will go over the graph Catalog and graph projection management in more detail in the next module.

. *Execute Algorithms*: This includes classic graph algorithms such as centrality, community detection, path finding, etc. It also includes embeddings, a form of robust graph feature engineering, as well as machine learning pipelines.

. *Store Results*: There are a few things you may want to do with the output/result of graph algorithms.  GDS enables you to write results back to the database, export to disk in csv format, or stream results into another application or downstream workflow.


=== GDS Configuration
GDS runs greedily in respect to system resources which means it will use as much memory and CPU cores as it needs - not exceeding limits configured by the user.

If you are running in AuraDS, the GDS configuration is fully managed out-the-box, so the below information won't be relevant to getting started.  For other Neo4j deployments, however, configuring workloads and memory allocation to make best use of the available system resources is important to maximize performance.

==== CPU and Concurrency
GDS uses multiple CPU cores for graph projections, algorithms, and writing results. This allows GDS to parallelize its computations and significantly speed up processing time.  The level of parallelization is configured per execution via the _concurrency_ parameter in the projection, algorithm, or other operation method.

The default concurrency used for most operations in GDS is 4.  4 is also the maximum concurrency that can be used with the Community license. In GDS Enterprise, concurrency is unlimited.

==== Memory
GDS runs within a Neo4j instance and is therefore subject to the general Neo4j memory configuration. Below is an illustration of Neo4j memory management. Neo4j uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and, as such, memory management is divided into _heap_ and _off-heap_ usage.

Of the above, two main types of memory can be allocated in configuration:

* *Heap Space:* Used for storing in-memory graphs, executing GDS algorithms, query execution, and transaction state

* *Page Cache:* Used for indexes and to cache the Neo4j data stored on disk. Improves performance for querying the database and projecting graphs.

==== Recommendations for Memory Configuration
Data Science computing has a tendency to be memory intensive and GDS is no exception.  In general, we recommend being generous when configuring the heap size, allocating as much heap as possible while still providing sufficient page cache to load your data and support Cypher queries. This can be done via the `dbms.memory.heap.initial_size` and `dbms.memory.heap.max_size` in the Neo4j configuration.

You can also use *Memory Estimation* to gauge heap size requirements early on. Memory estimation is a procedure in GDS which allows you to estimate the memory needed for running a projection, algorithm, or other operation on your data BEFORE actually executing it. We will go through the exact commands for memory estimation in our Neo4j Graph Data Science Fundamentals Course.

As far as page cache is concerned, for purely analytical workloads it is recommended to decrease page cache in favor of an increased heap size. However, setting a minimum page cache size is still important when projecting graphs. This minimum can be estimated at approximately `8KB * 100 * readConcurrency` for standard, native, projections. Page cache size can be set via `dbms.memory.pagecache.size` in the Neo4j configuration.

For more information and detailed guidance on tuning these configurations please see the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/system-requirements/[systems requirements documentation^].

== Summary
In this lesson you learned about how GDS works and the high-level workflow in GDS.  You also learned about GDS concurrency and Neo4j memory configurations to support GDS workloads.

In the next module you will learn about graph management, the graph catalog, and working with graph projections in more detail.
