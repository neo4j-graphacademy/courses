= 1. GDS Workflow

GDS transforms and loads data into:

* [ ] a graph OLAP cube
* [x] an in-memory graph format
* [ ] a separate analytical view stored on disk with the database
* [ ] a Python process

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Performing graph algorithms _in-memory_ offers several benefits, including faster computation and analysis due to reduced I/O overhead, improved scalability and efficiency in handling large graph datasets, and the ability to iterate and explore graph structures dynamically without the need for persistent storage operations.
