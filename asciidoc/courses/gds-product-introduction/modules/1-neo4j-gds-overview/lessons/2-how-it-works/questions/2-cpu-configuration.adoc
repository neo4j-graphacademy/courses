= 2. CPU Configuration

How is CPU concurrency configured in GDS?

* [x] Per execution via the concurrency parameter in the projection, algorithm, or other operation method
* [ ] GDS runs within a Neo4j instance and is therefore subject to the general Neo4j concurrency setting in the Neo4j configuration
* [ ] GDS has its own properties file where the concurrency setting can be set
* [ ] Concurrency cannot be configured in GDS
