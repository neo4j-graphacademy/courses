= Graph Management
:order: 2

== Module Overview

In the previous module you learned that GDS algorithms run on a projected in-memory graph data model. In this module, you will learn how to create and manage these graph projections using the Graph Catalog.

In this module, you will learn:

* How to manage projections with the Graph Catalog and its core operations.
* The different types of projections available in GDS and their use cases.
* How and when to use native projections for optimal performance.
* How and when to use Cypher projections for flexibility.
