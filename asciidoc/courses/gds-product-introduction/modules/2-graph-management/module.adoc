= Graph Management
:order: 2

== Module Overview

In the previous module you learned that GDS algorithms run on a projected in-memory graph data model. In this module, you will learn how to create and manage these graph projections.

In this module, you will learn:

* how to manage projections with the Graph Catalog
* the different types of projections available in GDS
* how and when to use native projections
* how and when to use cypher projections
