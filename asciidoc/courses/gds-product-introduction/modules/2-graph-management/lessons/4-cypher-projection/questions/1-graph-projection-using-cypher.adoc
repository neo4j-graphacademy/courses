= 1. Creating a Cypher Projection

Select the correct Cypher statement to create a Cypher projection between `Customer` and `Product` nodes:

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (customer:Customer)-[:PURCHASED]->(product:Product)
/*select:WITH gds.graph.project('proj', customer, product)
 AS g*/
RETURN g
----

* [ ] `WITH gds.graph.project('proj', source)`
* [ ] `WITH gds.graph.project('proj', source, target)`
* [x] `WITH gds.graph.project('proj', customer, product)`
* [ ] `WITH gds.graph.project('proj', ['Customer', 'Product'], ':PURCHASED')`


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
`gds.graph.project` expects the source and target nodes as defined in the `MATCH` clause.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The answer is `WITH gds.graph.project('proj', customer, product)` as the `MATCH` clause defines the `customer` and `product` nodes.
