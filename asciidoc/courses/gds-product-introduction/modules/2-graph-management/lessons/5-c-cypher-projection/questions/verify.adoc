= Create a Cypher Projection

Create a cypher projection representing all `User` nodes that have rated a `Movie` with a release `year` **greater than** 2014.

The projection must use the name `movie-ratings-after-2014`

Complete the following Cypher query by replacing the `??????` with the correct values.

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (??????:User)-[r:RATED]->(??????:Movie)
WHERE ??????.year > ????
WITH gds.graph.project(
  '??????', 
  ??????, 
  ??????
) AS g
RETURN
  g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

Once you have created the projection, you can verify that it was created successfully by listing the graph projections in the database:

[source, cypher,role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list() YIELD graphName
----

Click the **Check Database** button to verify that there is a projection named `movie-ratings-after-2014` and that the task is complete.

.Hint
====
The Cypher needed to create the projection is:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:User)-[r:RATED]->(target:Movie)
WHERE target.year > 2014
----

The `source` and `target` nodes should be passed to the `gds.graph.project` function:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:User)-[r:RATED]->(target:Movie)
WHERE target.year > 2014

WITH gds.graph.project(
  '??????', 
  ??????, 
  ??????
) AS g
RETURN
  g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
