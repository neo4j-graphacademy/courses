The challenges in this course come thick and fast!

In this challenge, you will modify the `Save()` method in the link:{repository-blob}main/pkg/services/ratings.go[`RatingService`^] to save ratings into Neo4j.

== The Request Lifecycle

image::images/rating-form.png[Rating a Movie, role=right]

Before we start, let's take a look at the request lifecycle when saving a review.
If you prefer, you can skip to <<Saving a Rating>>.

On every Movie page, the user is invited to rate a movie on scale of 1 to 5.
The form pictured to the right gives the user the ability to select a rating between 1 and 5 and click submit to save the rating.

When the form is submitted, the website sends a request to `/api/account/ratings/{movieId}` and the following will happen:

1. The server directs the request to the route handler in link:{repository-blob}main/pkg/routes/account.go[`api/routes/account.go`^], which verifies the user's JWT token before handling the request.
2. The route handler uses the injected `RatingService` instance to create a new rating by calling the `Save()` method using the ID of the current user, the ID of the movie and a rating from the request body.
3. It is then the responsibility of the `Save()` method to save this information to the database and return an appropriate response.

A rating is represented in the graph a relationship going from a `:User` to a `:Movie` node with the type `:RATED`.  The relationship has two properties; the rating (an integer) and a timestamp to represent when the relationship was created.

After the data is saved, the UI expects the movie details to be returned, with an additional property called `rating`, which will be the rating that the user has given for the movie.

Let's take a look at the existing method in the `RatingService`.

.pkg/services/ratings.go
[source,go,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/pkg/services/ratings.go[tag=add]

This currently returns the value of a JSON file in the fixtures folder.

Your challenge is to replace the `TODO` comments in this method with working code.


== Saving a Rating

Complete the following steps to complete the challenge:

1. <<Open a new Session>>
2. <<Execute a Cypher query within a new Write Transaction>>
3. <<Return the Results>>


=== Open a new Session

Use the `rs` variable passed to the `Save()` method to access the Driver instance and call the `.NewSession()` method to open a new session.

Then use the `defer` keyword to close the session once the function has returned.

[source,go,indent=0]
.Open a new Session
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/services/ratings.go[tag="session"]
----


=== Execute a Cypher query within a new Write Transaction

Next, use the `session` object to open a new write transaction.
Within the write transaction you should create a relationship between the `:User` and `:Movie` nodes by executing the following query:

// TODO: Move to cypher repository

.Creating Ratings
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User {userId: $userId})
MATCH (m:Movie {tmdbId: $movieId})

MERGE (u)-[r:RATED]->(m)
SET r.rating = $rating, r.timestamp = timestamp()

RETURN m { .*, rating: r.rating } AS movie
----

As this query creates a single node, it will only ever return one result, so the `movie` value may be taken from the first row using the `Single()` method.


.Executing the Query
[source,go,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/services/ratings.go[tag=create_rating,indent=0]
----

[TIP]
By using the `MERGE` keyword here, we will overwrite an existing rating if one already exists.
This way we don't need to worry about duplicates or deleting existing records.

=== Return the Results

If the unit of work is successful, a map will be returned with the user properties and the `rating` value from the newly created relationship.

If the unit of work returns an error for any reason, return the error.
Otherwise, use the brackets method to extract the `movie` value from the record and return it cast as a `Movie` struct.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you have updated the `RatingService` to save a relationship between a User and Movie to represent a Rating.

In the next Challenge, you will follow the same steps to implement the My Favorites feature.
