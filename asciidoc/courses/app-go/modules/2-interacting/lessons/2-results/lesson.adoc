= Processing Results
:type: quiz

Query results are typically consumed as a stream of records.
The drivers provide a way to iterate through that stream.

== Result

Here is an example query which retrieves a list of `:Person` nodes related to a given Movie.

.Get Actors by Movie title
[source,go,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/15-person-profile/example/main.go[tag="getActors"]
----

In this example, the following things happen:

1. A new instance of the Driver is created
2. If an error occurs when creating the driver instance, it can be handled by checking the error returned by the declaration
3. Once the function returns, close the driver instance and release any resources
4. Create a new session with the intention of queryig the `movies` database
5. Close the session once the function returns
6. Execute a Cypher query and get the result
7. If any errors occur during the execution of the query, for example connection errors, timeouts or syntax errors
8. Loop through the results
9. Consume the next result from the stream



=== Accessing a Record using `.Record()`

In the above example, the `for` loop will iterate through the results using the `.Next()` function

While `.Next()` returns `true`, you can call the `.Record()` method to get the next record from the stream.

It is important to verify the value returned by the `.Err()` is `false` after calling the `.Next()` method to find out whether the the last result is the final result witin the stream, or an error has occurred to cause the end of result consumption.


// === `NextRecord()`

Alternatively, you can use the `.NextRecord()` method which has the same outcome with slightly less code.

== Getting the only result with `.Single()`

If you are expecting a single result, you can call the `.Single()` method to access the first and only result.

----

If the result stream contains zero or more than one records, an error is returned.


== Get all remaining results with `.Collect()`

The `.Collect()` method fetches all remaining records and returns them as an array.

include::{repository-raw}/15-person-profile/example/main.go[tag="Collect"]

== Consume remaining results with `.Consume()`

Calling the `.Consume()` method will discard any remaining records from the stream and return a `ResultSummary` object which holds information about the statement execution, including database information, execution time and in the case of a write query, statistics on changes made to the database as a result of the statement execution.

== Exploring Records

The `record` variable above provides an interface to retrieve individual values.
Take the example above, each record will contain information on `:Movie` and `:Person` nodes, and the `:ACTED_IN` relationship.

To access the keys available in each record, you can use the `.Keys` property.
This is an array of strings.

.The Keys Array

----
include::{repository-raw}/15-person-profile/example/main.go[tag="keys"]

To access these values, we can either use the index of the key above, or the alias specified in the `RETURN` portion of the Cypher statement.

== Lesson Summary

You now have all of the information required to send Cypher queries to Neo4j and consume the results.

Next, we will look at the Neo4j Type System and some of the considerations that you need to make when working with values coming from Neo4j in your Go application.
