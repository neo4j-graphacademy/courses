:test-output: true

Now for another challenge.

In this challenge, you will use the knowledge gained so far in this course to add new functionality to the API.
You will modify the `all()` method of the link:{repository-blob}main/api/dao/movies.py[`MovieDAO`^] to do the following:


1. <<Create a Unit of Work>>
2. <<Open a new Session>>
3. <<Extract a list of Movies from the Result>>
4. <<Return the Results>>

Once you have completed the challenge, you will be asked to run a unit test to verify that the code has been correctly implemented.
If the test runs correctly, the title of the highest rated movie will be logged.
You will need this value to verify that the test has run correctly.


== Exploring the Code

Before you start, let's take a look at the code.
If you are not interested in exploring the code, you can skip straight to <<Implementing Read Transactions>>.

If you start the application and access the app at http://localhost:5000, you will see two lists on the home page; one for Popular Movies and one for Latest Releases.
Both of these lists are populated by a request to link:http://localhost:5000/api/movies[`http://localhost:5000/api/movies`^] with some additional parameters.

=== Route Handler

You can find the route handler, the function that handles the request, in the movies blueprint at link:{repository-blob}main/api/routes/movies.py[`api/routes/movies.py`^]:

.api/routes/movie.py
[source,go,role=nocopy]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/api/routes/movies.py[tag=list]
----

Within the route handler, you can see that:

1. The `sort`, `order`, `limit` and `skip` values are extracted from the query string.  This allows us to apply sorting and pagination to the results.
2. A new instance of the `MovieDAO` is created with the Driver instance that you created in link:../../1-driver/3-connecting/[Adding the Driver] passed to the constructor.
3. The results are retrieved via the `all()` method and are returned by the handler as JSON.

=== The Movie DAO

The magic happens in the `MovieDAO`, located at link:{repository-blob}main/api/dao/movies.py[`api/dao/movies.py`^].
For this route we are concerned with the `all()` method.

If we take a closer look at the `all()` method, we can see that it currently returns a hardcoded list of popular movies from a another file in the repository.

[source,go,indent=0]
.api/dao/movies.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/api/dao/movies.py[tag=all]
----

You will need to replace these `TODO` comments with working code to complete the challenge.


== Implementing Read Transactions

As you learned in the Sessions and Transactions lesson, you will complete code to open a new session and run the query within a Read Transaction.
Once the query has run, you add code to close the session.
Then, finally you add code to extract and return the results.

=== Create a Unit of Work

First, create a new `get_movies` to represent the unit of work.

This function will have one mandatory argument passed to it, a `Transaction` instance that you can use to execute a Cypher statement using the `run()` method.
The function should also have the `sort`, `order`, `skip`, `limit` and `userId` parameters passed through as named parameters - these will be referenced in the query by prefixing the name with a dollar sign (`$`).

.Define the function
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/api/dao/movies.py[tag=get_movies,indent=0]
    # Code will go here...
----

You will need to call the `run()` method on the `tx` argument, passing a Cypher query to retrieve a list of paginated movie results along with named arguments `sort`, `order`, `skip`, `limit` and `userId`.

.Define and Execute a Cypher Query
[source,go,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/api/dao/movies.py[tag=allcypher]
----


=== Extract a list of Movies from the Result

The individual movie values can then be extracted from the `result` variable using a list comprehension.

[source,go,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/api/dao/movies.py[tag=allmovies]
----

[WARNING]
.Consuming Results
====
Make sure that you extract the results within the unit of work.
Once the transaction function ends, any results that have not been consumed will be lost.
====


=== Open a new Session

To execute the `get_movies` function within a Read Transaction, first open a new session:

.Open a new Session
[source,go,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.py[tag=driver.session]
----


=== Return the Results

Then the output of the `get_movies` function can then be returned.

.Return the results from the Unit of Work
[source,go,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/api/dao/movies.py[tag=return]

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you used your knowledge of sessions and transactions to retrieve a list of Movie nodes from the database.

In the next Challenge, you will write data to the database.
