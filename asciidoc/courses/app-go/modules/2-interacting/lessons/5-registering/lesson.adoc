= Registering a User
:type: challenge
:branch: 03-registering-a-user
:test-filename: 03_registering_a_user_test
:test-function: TestRegisterUser

Now that you have read data from the database, you are now ready to write data to the database.

In this challenge, you will rewrite the `Save()` method in the link:{repository-blob}main/pkg/services/auth.go[`AuthService`^] to do the following:

1. <<Open a new Session>>
2. <<Execute a Cypher query within a new Write Transaction>>
3. <<Extract the User from the Result>>
4. <<Return the User and JWT Token>>

This process may start to get a little repetitive, but it worth repeating to get used to working with the Neo4j Go Driver.


== Registering Users

A key piece of functionality that the application should provide is for new users to be able to register themselves with the site.
This functionality is already built into the front end, but at the moment the credentials are hard coded in the API.
This might be fine for demo purposes, but limiting the number of users to one is bad for Neoflix's bottom line.

The dummy register logic is already written into the `Save()` method of the `AuthService` implementation in `pkg/services/auth.go`.  As we can see from the snippet below, at the moment it will only accept an email address of `graphacademy@neo4j.com`.

The current implementation reads user information from a test fixture and uses that information to generate a JWT token.
The private `userWithToken()` function in `auth.go` then combines the two into a format that the format that the UI expects.


== Implementing Write Transactions

You will follow similar steps to the previous challenge, with the one change that the Cypher query will be executed within a Write Transaction.

To do so, you will need to call the `WriteTransaction()` method on the `session` object with a function to represent unit of work.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge.


=== Open a new Session

As with the previous lesson, use the `as` variable to access the Driver, and use the `NewSession()` method to open a new session.

Then use the `defer` keyword to close the session once the function has returned, utilising the `DeferredClose` function from the `ioutils` package.

=== Execute a Cypher query within a new Write Transaction

Within the session, call the `WriteTransaction()` method with two arguments.

1. A Cypher query to `CREATE` a new `:User` node in the database, with parameters passed to the function prefixed with a dollar sign (`$`).
2. An object containing the values relating to the parameters prefixed with `$` in the Cypher query.
  a. `email` - provided as the first parameter to the `Save()` method
  b. `encrypted` - The encrypted password
  c. `name` - The name as provided as the third parameter to the `Save()` method

=== Extract the User from the Result

The Cypher query executed above will return the newly-created `:User` node as `u`.
As this query creates a single node, it will only ever return one result, so the `u` value may be taken from the first row using the `Single()` method.

=== Return the User and JWT Token

As the transaction function returns the user record, this can be used to replace the hardcoded `user` variable.

The existing code will then generate the JWT token and return a map with the combined token and user properties.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you wrote the code to create a new User node to Neo4j.

We still have a `TODO` comment in the method for handling unique constraint violations in the database, so let's learn about that in the next lesson.
