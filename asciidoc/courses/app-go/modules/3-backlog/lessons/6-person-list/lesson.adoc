If you open click on the **People** link in the main navigation, you will see link:http://localhost:5000/people/[a paginated list of actors and directors^].

== People Search

A list of people can be retrieved by calling the link:http://localhost:5000/people/[http://localhost:5000/people/^] endpoint.
The list is populated by the `all()` method in the link:{repository-blob}main/api/dao/people.py[`PeopleDAO`^].

This person lists vary slightly from the movie lists because this features a **Search by Name** input.
When this value is set, an additional `q` parameter is passed to `tx.run()`, and if defined, the query adds an additional `CONTAINS` predicate.

[TIP]
.Using Text Indexes
The `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH` and `CONTAINS` predicates are **case-sensitive**.
If you are looking for a case-insensitive search, you should consider setting up a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes-for-full-text-search/[full-text schema index^].


== Your Task

* Modify the `all()` method to query Neo4j and return a list of people.
* If the `q` parameter is defined, add a `WHERE` clause to check that the `name` property contains the value provided.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you implemented the `all()`  method in the `PeopleDAO` to return a paginated list of people from the Neo4j database and implemented a conditional `WHERE` clause on the `Person` `name` property.

In the next Challenge, you will retrieve an individual's details from the database.
