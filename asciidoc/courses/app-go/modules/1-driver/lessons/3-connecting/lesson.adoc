= Adding the Driver

This is your first challenge of this course.
Your challenge here is to modify the code to create a new instance of the Driver that can be used across the application.

As we discussed in the link:../1-about/[About the Driver lesson], it is best practice to create a single instance of the driver in our application per Neo4j cluster or DBMS.

Inside link:{repository-blob}main/pkg/config/config.go[`pkg/config/config.go`^], you will see a `NewDriver()` function.


.pkg/config/config.go
[source,go,role=nocopy]
----
// TODO
// include::{repository-raw}/main/pkg/config/config.go[tag=initDriver]
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/config/config.go[tag=initDriver]
----

The function takes one argument, `settings`, which contains application config loaded by the `ReadConfig()` function, including `Uri`, `Username` and `Password` which will be required to create a new Driver instance.

This method is called in link:{repository-blob}main/cmd/neoflix/main.go[`cmd/neoflix/main.go`^] to initiate the new Driver instance and pass it as an argument to each of the service classes.

.cmd/neoflix/main.go

== Challenge: Implement the NewDriver function.

Your first challenge is to modify the `NewDriver()` function in `pkg/config/config.go` to create and return an instance of the driver.
To do this, we will need to:

1. Install the `neo4j` dependency using the `go get` command.
2. Import the `github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v4/neo4j` dependency into `config.go`
3. Create the driver instance with the `Uri`, `Username` and `Password` values provided by the `Config` object.
4. Use the `driver.VerifyConnectivity()` method to assert that the credentials are correct.


=== 1. Install the `neo4j` Dependency

First, you will need to install the `neo4j` dependency.
Run the following command in your terminal session:

.Install neo4j
[source,sh]
----
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v4
----


=== 2. Importing the Dependency

To include the Driver dependency in our module, you will need to add `github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v4/neo4j` to your `import` command to the top of the file.
Copy and paste the following code at the top of `pkg/config/config.go`.

[source,go,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/config/config.go[tag=import]
----


=== 3. Creating the Driver Instance

Create the driver instance by calling the `neo4j.NewDriver()` function.
The first argument will be the `Uri` held in the `settings` variable
The second argument will be the auth token, created using the `neo4j.BasicAuth()` method using the `Username` and `Password` settings held in the `settings` variable


Replace the `NewDriver` placeholder function with the following code:

.pkg/config/config.go
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/config/config.go[tag=initDriver]
----

The function calls the `VerifyConnectivity()` function on the driver instance to verify that the connection details are correct before returning the newly created driver instance.

If the connection cannot be made for any reason, an error will be returned.
If this occurs, your application will be unable to communicate with Neo4j.
Manual investigation will be required to diagnose the issue.

If the connection has been successfully verified, the function will return an instance of the driver.


// == Testing Connectivity
include::../../../../includes/test.adoc[]

// To test that the driver has been setup correctly, run the following command in a new terminal session:

== Lesson Summary

You have implemented the code to create a new driver instance with application configuration read from the `config.json` file in the project root which verifies that the driver can connect to the DBMS before the server starts.

In the next module we will look at how to use the driver to query the DBMS.
