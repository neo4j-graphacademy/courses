= Connection Strings and Authentication
:type: quiz
:branch: main

In the previous lesson, you saw some example code for creating a new driver instance.
Let's take a closer look at the `NewDriver()` function and how it is used to create a driver instance.

.Creating a Driver Instance

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/example/main.go[tag=pseudo]
----

The `neo4j.NewDriver()` function accepts the following arguments:

1. A connection string
2. An authentication method to use when connecting - in this case, username/password authentication
3. Optionally, you can provide a function to provide additional configuration

Let's take a look at these points in more detail.

// == 1. Connection String
include::{shared}/courses/apps/connection-strings.adoc[tags="connectionstring"]


== `2` An Authentication Token

In most cases, you will connect to the DBMS using basic authentication consisting of a username and password.
You can create a basic authentication token by calling the `BasicAuth()` function provided by the `neo4j` object.

== `3` Additional Driver Configuration (Optional)

The `NewDriver()` function also accepts an optional configuration parameter.

This object allows you to provide advanced configuration options, for example setting the connection pool size or changing timeout limits.

To provide additional configuration to the driver, pass a function as the third argument.
The function will be passed one argument, an instance of `neo4j.Config`, which can be used to set any advanced configuration options.

.Example Additional Configuration
[source,go,role=nocopy]
----
driver, err = NewDriver(uri, BasicAuth(username, password), function (config *Config) {
    config.MaxConnectionPoolSize = 10
})
