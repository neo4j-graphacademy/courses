= Using SingleTWithContext

If a `neo4j.Result` with more than one row is passed to the `neo4j.SingleTWithContext()`, what values will be returned?

- [*] a zero-value and `error`
- [ ] `nil` and `nil`
- [ ] `neo4j.Record` and `nil`
- [ ] None, the application will exit


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The `neo4j.SingleTWithContext()` function expects a result with exactly one row passed to it.
If zero or more than one rows are contained in the result, an error will be returned.
====


[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====

Two things will happen.  The first record from the result set will be processed and returned as the first value.
As the function expects exactly one row, an error will be returned as the second value.
