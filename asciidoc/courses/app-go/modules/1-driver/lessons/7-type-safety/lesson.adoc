In the previous lesson, we looked at how Neo4j types are used in Go.
The driver provides a set of type-safe functions which guarantee the type of value returned by the function.
These functions protect against unwanted side effects when dealing with the data returned by the database.

== Neo4j Types to Go Types

Let's start with the following Cypher statement which finds all people who have acted in a movie.
The Cypher statement returns two `neo4j.Node` types, `person` and `movie`, and one `neo4j.Relationship`.

.Actors for a Movie
[source,cypher,role=norun]
----
MATCH (person:Person)-[actedIn:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie {title: $title})
RETURN person, actedIn, movie
----

The returned value can be represented in a _struct_.

.Representing Results in a Go struct
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/generics.go[tag=struct,indent=0]
----

This struct can then be used to define value returned by `session.Run()`, `neo4j.ExecuteRead()` and `neo4j.ExecuteWrite()`.

.Using the struct
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/generics.go[tag=use-struct,indent=0]
----

In the code sample above, the `neo4j.CollectTWithContext()` function is used to return a slice of `personActedInMovie` structs.
The code uses the `neo4j.GetRecordValue()` helper function to extract a value from each record.

Let's look at the functions used in this sample in more detail.

== CollectTWithContext

The `neo4j.CollectTWithContext()` function is used to iterate through the records held in a `neo4j.Result` object and abstract any required values.

.Using CollectTWithContext
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/generics.go[tag=collecttwithcontext,indent=0]
----

The function accepts three arguments:

1. An execution context
2. A `neo4j.Result`
3. A callback function that is called once per record in the buffer.  The function is passed one argument, a `neo4j.Record` which is used to access the values in each record.

In the code sample, `T` represents the type of value that the function will return.

The output of the function is a slice of values returned by the callback function.


== SingleTWithContext

Alternatively, if you expect one result, you can use the `neo4j.SingleTWithContext()` function.
The function signature is similar, but instead the function will return a single value instead of a slice.


.Using SingleTWithContext
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/generics.go[tag=singletwithcontext,indent=0]
----


[WARNING]
.For Single Results Only
If the result contains zero or more than one result, the function will return an error.


== GetRecordValue

The `neo4j.GetRecordValue()` function allows you to access a value from a `neo4j.Record` by its key and guarantee the type of value returned.

.Using GetRecordValue
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/generics.go[tag=getrecordvalue,indent=0]
----

The function above extracts the `person` value from the `record` variable, cast as a `neo4j.Node`.

The function returns three values:

1. The casted value, or an empty value
2. A boolean to represent whether the returned value is included in the record or not.  This value should be used to disambiguate from any returned default values such as `0` or empty strings)
3. An error will be returned if the value does not exist on the record or the value cannot be cast as the requested type.

The following table illustrates what will be returned depending on whether the value has been successfully cast, is `nil` or cannot be cast as the requested type.


// [Attributes]
|===
|Returned value | Outcome | `person` | `isNil` | `err`


| `(:Person {name: "Arya"})`
| Node is returned
| An instance of `neo4j.Node`
| `false`
| `nil`

| `nil`
| No node is returned (e.g. Using `OPTIONAL MATCH`)
| an empty `neo4j.Node`
| `true`
| `nil`

| `"string"`
| Not the specified type
| an empty `neo4j.Node`
| `false`
| an `error`

|===


== GetProperty

The code sample at the start of this lesson returns a `personActedInMovie` struct, which contains `neo4j.Node` and `neo4j.Relationship` types.
Properties of both nodes and relationships can be accessed using the `neo4j.GetProperty` functions.


.Accessing Node & Relationship Properties
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/generics.go[tag="node-property",indent=0]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/generics.go[tag="rel-property",indent=0]
----

If the property exists and adheres to the type specification, the value is returned.
If the property does not exist or doesn't adhere to the type specification, an error is returned.

In this challenge, you used your knowledge to create a driver instance and execute a Cypher statement.

In the next Challenge, you will modify the repository to read from the database.
