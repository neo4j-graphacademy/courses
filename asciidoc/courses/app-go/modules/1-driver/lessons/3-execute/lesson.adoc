In the last challenge, you used `session.Run()` to execute a Cypher statement in an auto-complete transaction.
While that may be convenient for one-off statements but is not suitable for production applications.

When using Neo4j in a clustered environment, the server will not attempt to retry the query when using `session.Run()`.
In the case of transient errors, for example, changes to the cluster topology, Cypher statements explicitly executed within a read or write transaction will be retried in an attempt to cause minimal disruption to your application.


== Neo4j Clusters

When running Neo4j in production or using link:https://neo4j.com/cloud[Neo4j Aura^], you will most likely be querying a _cluster_ of nodes rather than a single instance.

Neo4j clusters consist of a set of _core_ nodes responsible for reaching consensus when writing data to a database.
Additional read-only servers called _Read Replicas_ can be added to increase the possible number of simultaneous read queries at any time.

In a clustered environment, the driver can connect to any member within the cluster.
Once connected, the driver will receive metadata about the cluster, known as a **Routing Table**.

=== Reading Data from Neo4j

The driver uses data from the Routing Table to distribute read statements across the cluster in a least-connected fashion, ensuring that the cluster is evenly utilised.

To execute a Cypher statement within a read transaction, call the `neo4j.ExecuteRead()` method.

The `neo4j.ExecuteRead()` method expects the execution context (1), the session object (2) and a function to represent the unit of work (3).

The function has a single argument passed, an instance of a `neo4j.ManagedTransaction`, on which the `Run()` method can be called multiple times to execute Cypher statements.

The `tx.Run()` method is similar to `session.Run()` in that it accepts two parameters; a Cypher statement and an object representing the query parameters.

In the example above, the `neo4j.SingleTWithContext()` function is used to extract the `p` value from each returned record.
In this case, the return type has been cast as a `neo4j.Node`.

If an error occurs for any reason during the transaction, the second returned value (`err`) will provide more information.


=== Writing Data to Neo4j

The cluster will always contain one instance, known as the **Leader**, which has the responsibility of processing write transactions for a specific database.
The Leader is responsible for distributing the transaction's outcome across the cluster.
Once the majority of core servers acknowledge this information, the transaction is considered _committed_ and acknowledgement is sent back to the Driver along with any data requested by the Cypher statement.

To execute a Cypher statement within a write transaction, call the `neo4j.ExecuteWrite()` method.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned the best practices for reading data from and writing data to Neo4j.
You also learned how to access the records returned by `session.Run()` and `tx.Run()`.

In the next challenge, you will use this knowledge to execute a Cypher statement in a read transaction.
