= Writing Data to Neo4j

Your challenge is to modify another pre-written file to add yourself as an actor in The Matrix.

== Steps

Open the `pkg/challenges/write/challenge.go` file:

1. Update the `params` object to use your name.
This step isn't strictly required, just a bit of fun.


2. The Cypher statement is already written for you.
Use the `neo4j.ExecuteRead()` method, passing the `ctx` and `session` variables, and a callback function to represent the unit of transactional work.


3. In that function you must call the `Run()` method on the first parameter passed to the query, using the `cypher` and `params` variables.

4. `await` the results and use `fmt.Println()` to check that the code has executed correctly.

5. To add the new node and relationship to the database, click the Debug icon to the left of the window and run **Writing Data Challenge** task, or use the integrated terminal window to run the following command: +
+
.Run The Challenge
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
go run {lab-file}
----

6. Once the code has run, click **Verify** and we will check that the node has been added to the database.

== Lesson Summary

In this challenge, you used your knowledge to create a driver instance and execute a Cypher statement.

You should now have everything you need to use the Neo4j Go Driver in your next Go project.
