In the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] course, we cover how to query Neo4j using a language called Cypher.
To execute a Cypher statement against a Neo4j database you will use an object called a *Driver*.

To connect to and query Neo4j from within a Go application, you use the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/go[Neo4j Go Driver^].



== Installing the Driver

The Neo4j Go Driver is available through link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j[pkg.go.dev^].
The Neo4j Go Driver can be installed using the `go get` command.

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/README.adoc[tag=install]


== Importing the Library

The `github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver` package exports a `neo4j` object which contains several helper functions for interacting with Neo4j.


.Importing The Driver
[source,go,indent=0,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=import]
----

== Creating a Driver Instance

To create a new instance of the driver, you can use the `neo4j.NewDriverWithContext()` function provided by the driver library, which accepts neo4j credentials and returns a new driver object.

.Creating a Driver Instance
[source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=driver]
----

The function expects two arguments;

1. A Connection URI - for example, `neo4j://localhost:7687` or `neo4j+s://dbhash.databases.neo4j.io`
2. An authentication _token_


[TIP]
.Authentication Types
====
Neo4j supports four authentication methods, basic authentication (e.g. username and password or LDAP), a base64 encoded Bearer token, a Kerberos token, or a custom authentication token.
For more information on these options, visit link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/[Authentication and Authorization^].
====


=== Verifying Connectivity

You can verify that the connection details used during driver instantiation are correct by calling the `driver.VerifyConnectivity()` method.

This function returns an error with the `Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized` code if the provided credentials are incorrect.

== Sessions

From the driver object, you will open one or more **sessions**.
A session is a client-side abstraction that borrows underlying TCP connections from a _connection pool_ held by the Driver and uses them to communicate with Neo4j.

Sessions should be considered lightweight and disposable and can be opened and closed at will.
To close a session, call the `.Close()` method.
This will release any underlying TCP connections held by the session object.


.Session Lifecycle
[source,go]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tags=session,run,session-close,indent=0]
----

You can implicitly `defer` the closing of each session object, which will release any underlying TCP connections held by the session object once the surrounding context has completed.

== Running a Sample Query

To run a one-off Cypher query, you can use the `session.Run()` method.

.Running a One-off Query
[source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=oneoff]
----

The method accepts four arguments:

1. The execution context.
2. A string to represent a Cypher statement
3. An optional map representing query parameters (prefixed in Cypher with `$`).
4. Optional, a map containing transaction config.


[WARNING]
.For one-off queries only
If there are any transient errors when running a query, the driver will not attempt to retry a query when using `session.Run()`.
For this reason, these should only be used for one-off queries and not in production.

=== Processing Results

The `result` value in the code sample above will be an implementation of the `ResultWithContext` interface.
This can be used in conjunction with the  `neo4j.CollectTWithContext()` function to access the values returned by Neo4j.
The function expects a context object, a `ResultWithContext` object, and an accessor function.

The function is passed one argument, an instance of `neo4j.Record`, which can be passed to the `neo4j.GetRecordValue()` method.

.Accessing Results
[source,go,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/pkg/example/example.go[tag=oneoffresult]
----


In the code sample above, the `p` value is extracted from each node using the `neo4j.GetRecordValue()` function, which is assigned to the `person` variable.
In this instance, `p` refers to a Neo4j Node, which is hydrated into an instance of the `neo4j.Node` interface.

Should the `p` key not exist on the record or any other error occurs while trying to retrieve the value, the subsequent error will be assigned to the `err` variable.


We will cover result processing in more detail in link:../3-execute[Lesson 3: Read and Write Transactions^].


== Closing the Driver

The Driver provides a `.Close()` method, which closes any open sessions, disconnect all servers and release any resources held by the driver.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned the basics of the Neo4j Go Driver, how to install the dependency, create a new driver instance and execute a sample query.

In the next lesson, you will use this knowledge to query a Neo4j Sandbox instance.
