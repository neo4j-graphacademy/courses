Your challenge is to add a new driver instance to an existing file with the connection details provided.
Once you have created the driver, you will need to open a new session and execute a Cypher statement to find the director of the movie **Toy Story**.


We have created a link:{repository-link}[repository^] for this course.
It contains the starter code and resources you need.

A Neo4j Sandbox instance has also been created for you to use during this course.

== Get the code

You can use link:https://gitpod.io[Gitpod^] as an online IDE and workspace for this workshop.
It will automatically clone the workshop repository and set up your environment.

lab::Open `Gitpod workspace`[]

[NOTE]
You will need to login with a Github account.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and set up the environment yourself.

[%collapsible]
.Develop on your local machine
====
You will need link:https://go.dev/doc/install[Go] installed and the ability to install the Neo4j driver using `go get`.

Clone the link:{repository-link}[https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-go] repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/app-go
----

Setup environment variables for the connection to the Neo4j Sandbox instance:

NEO4J_URI:: [copy]#bolt://{instance-ip}:{instance-boltPort}#
NEO4J_USERNAME:: [copy]#{instance-username}#
NEO4J_PASSWORD:: [copy]#{instance-password}#
====

== Steps

Open the `pkg/challenges/create_driver/challenge.go` file:

. Install the Neo4j Go Driver in the integrated terminal window
+
include::{repository-raw}/main/README.adoc[tag=install]

. Import the `github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j` symbol and use the `neo4j` object to create a new instance of the Driver with `Uri`, `Username` and `Password` credentials provided obtained using the `GetNeo4jCredentials()` method

. Once you have created the Driver, open a new session and execute the following `cypher` statement using the `params` map.
+
.Find the Director
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie {title: $title})
RETURN p.name AS Director
----

. To find the answer, click the Debug icon to the left of the IDE window and run **Create Driver Challenge** task, or use the integrated terminal window to run the following command: +
+
.Run The Challenge
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
go run {lab-file}
----

. Once you have the result, copy and paste it into the text box below and click **Check Answer**.
