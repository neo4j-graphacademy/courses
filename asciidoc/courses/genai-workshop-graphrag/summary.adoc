* Explored the `VectorRetriever` and `VectorCypherRetriever` for semantic and filtered searches.
* Utilized the `HybridRetriever` and `HybridCypherRetriever` to combine vector, full-text, and graph traversal techniques.
* Discovered the `Text2CypherRetriever` to translate natural language queries into Cypher.
* Built a multimodal application by combining textual and visual data.
