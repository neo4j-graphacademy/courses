== Understanding VectorRetriever

In previous tasks, you've built knowledge graphs by extracting entities and relationships from text. Now, we'll enhance your retrieval capabilities using the `VectorRetriever`. This retriever leverages vector embeddings to perform semantic searches, enabling you to find nodes based on the meaning of the content rather than just keywords.

== How It Works

* **Query Embedding**:
  - Converts the user's query into a vector using an embedding model.

* **Similarity Search**:
  - Finds nodes with embeddings similar to the query vector.

* **Retrieval**:
  - Returns the top relevant nodes to augment the language model's response.

== When to Use VectorRetriever

* **Semantic Search**:
  - When you need to find nodes based on the meaning of the content.

* **Unstructured Data**:
  - Ideal for graphs containing text-rich nodes like products, reviews, or descriptions.

* **Precomputed Embeddings**:
  - When nodes have embeddings stored as properties for efficient searching.

== Setting Up VectorRetriever

Follow these steps to set up and use the `VectorRetriever`.

=== Step 1: Initialize the Embedder

Create the embedding function using Sentence Transformers:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=embedder]
----

=== Step 2: Initialize the VectorRetriever

Set up the `VectorRetriever` with your Neo4j database and embedding model:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=retriever]
----

=== Step 3: Using the Retriever

Utilize the `VectorRetriever` to perform semantic searches within your Neo4j database:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=graphrag]
----

== Tips for Effective Use

* **Consistent Embeddings**:
  - Use the same model for both query and node embeddings to ensure compatibility.

* **Property Retrieval**:
  - Utilize the `return_properties` argument and `record_formatter` to retrieve and transform the desired properties effectively.

* **Adjust `top_k`**:
  - Since this retriever uses an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm, consider setting `top_k` to a higher value to improve the chances of retrieving relevant results.
