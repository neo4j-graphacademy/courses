= Creating Embeddings
:order: 4
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true


In this task, you will use Cypher to create embeddings.

In a later task will also use Python to create embeddings.

== Find a movie plot

In the previous task, you used a vector index to find similar movies.

To find a movie with a plot you define, you need to create an embedding for your text before you can query the vector index.

For example, to find a movie about "A mysterious spaceship lands Earth", you need to:

. Create an embedding for the text "A mysterious spaceship lands Earth".
. Pass the embedding to the `db.index.vector.queryNodes` function.

You can generate a new embedding in Cypher using the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/#single-embedding[`genai.vector.encode`^] function:

For example, you can use the `OpenAI` provider to generate an embedding passing the API key as `token` in the `configuration` map:

[source, cypher]
----
WITH genai.vector.encode(
    "Text to create embeddings for", 
    "OpenAI", 
    { token: "sk-..." }) AS embedding
RETURN embedding
----

[IMPORTANT]
Remember to replace `sk-...` with your OpenAI API key.

You can use the embedding to query the vector index to find similar movies.

[source, cypher]
----
WITH genai.vector.encode(
    "A mysterious spaceship lands Earth", 
    "OpenAI", 
    { token: "sk-..." }) AS myMoviePlot
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('moviePlots', 6, myMoviePlot)
YIELD node, score
RETURN node.title, node.plot, score
----

Experiment with different movie plots and observe the results.
