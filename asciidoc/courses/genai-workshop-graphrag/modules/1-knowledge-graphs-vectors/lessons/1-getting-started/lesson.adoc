.Develop on your local machine
====
You will need link:https://python.org[Python] installed and the ability to install packages using `pip`.

You may want to set up a virtual environment using link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[`venv`^] or link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[`virtualenv`^] to keep your dependencies separate from other projects.

Clone the link:{repository-link}[github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-workshop-graphrag] repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-workshop-graphrag
----

Install the required packages using `pip`:

[source,bash]
----
cd genai-workshop-graphrag
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

You do not need to create a Neo4j database as you will use the provided sandbox instance.
The sandbox includes Neo4j's GenAI functions which you can learn more about in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/genai-integrations/[Neo4j GenAI integration documentation^].
====

== Setup the environment

Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`.
Fill in the required values.

[source]
.Create a .env file
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/.env.example[]
----

Add your Open AI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), which you can get from link:https://platform.openai.com[platform.openai.com].

Update the Neo4j sandbox connection details:

NEO4J_URI:: [copy]#bolt://{instance-ip}:{instance-boltPort}#
NEO4J_USERNAME:: [copy]#{instance-username}#
NEO4J_PASSWORD:: [copy]#{instance-password}#

== Test your setup

You can test your setup by running `test_environment.py` - this will attempt to connect to the Neo4j sandbox and the OpenAI API.

You will see an `OK` message if you have set up your environment correctly. If any tests fail, check the contents of the `.env` file.

== Continue

When you are ready, you can move on to the next task.
