= Create a Vector Index
:order: 5
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

Your next task is to create a vector index using Cypher.

You previously used a vector index to find similar text; you can also use a vector index to find similar images.

== Movie posters

GraphAcademy has loaded a sample of 1000 movie poster embeddings into the sandbox.
Each movie has a URL to a poster image:

[source, cypher]
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Toy Story"})
RETURN m.title, m.poster

The data also contains embeddings for each poster:

[source, cypher]
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Toy Story"})
RETURN m.title, m.posterEmbedding

== Create a vector index

To search the movie poster embeddings, you must create a vector index.
Review the following Cypher to create the vector index before running it:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX moviePosters IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (m:Movie)
ON m.posterEmbedding
OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
 `vector.dimensions`: 512,
 `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}}
----

You should note the following about the index:

- It is named `moviePosters`
- It is against the `posterEmbedding` properties on `Movie` nodes
- The vector has `512` dimensions
- The function used to compare vectors is `cosine`

.More about dimensions
====
The model used to create the embeddings determines the number of dimensions in the vector.

In this case, we used the link:https://openai.com/research/clip[OpenAI Clip Model^], which has 512 dimensions.

We created the movie plot embeddings using link:https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models[Open AI's text-embedding-ada-002 model^], which has 1536 dimensions.
====

Run the Cypher to create the vector index.

Check that you created the index successfully using the `SHOW INDEXES` command.

.Show Indexes
[source,cypher]
----
SHOW VECTOR INDEXES
----

You should see a result similar to the following:

.Show Indexes Result
|===
| id | name | state | populationPercent | type
|4 | "moviePosters" | "ONLINE" | `100.0` | "VECTOR"
|===

Once the `state` is listed as "ONLINE", the index will be ready to query.

The `populationPercentage` field indicates the proportion of node and property pairing.
When the `populationPercentage` is `100.0`, all the movie embeddings have been indexed.

== Similar posters

You can use the `db.index.vector.queryNodes` procedure to find similar movie posters.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie{title: "Babe"})

CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('moviePosters', 6, m.posterEmbedding)
YIELD node, score

RETURN node.title, node.poster, score;
----

image:images/babe-similar-posters.jpg[3 movie posters, Babe, Lassie, Before the Rain with similar images,width=700,align=center]

Pick a different movie and write a similar Cypher query to find similar posters.

You can view the movies that have a poster embedding using this Cypher:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.posterEmbedding IS NOT NULL
RETURN m.title, m.poster
----

When you are ready, you can move on to the next task.

You learned how to create a vector index in Neo4j.

Next, you will learn how to create a full-text index on a node property.
