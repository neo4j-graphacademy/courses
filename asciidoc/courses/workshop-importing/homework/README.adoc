== Total Extended Learning Time

**67 minutes** of additional content to deepen your graph database skills.

== How to Use Homework

**After the workshop:**
1. Complete homework lessons in order (Module 3 → 5 → 6)
2. Each lesson builds on workshop concepts
3. Use your Northwind graph from the workshop
4. All exercises use the data you already imported

**Self-paced:**
- Work through at your own speed
- Skip sections you already understand
- Revisit as needed for deeper learning
