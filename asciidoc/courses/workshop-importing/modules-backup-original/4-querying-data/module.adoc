= Querying the Northwind Graph
:order: 4

In this module, you will learn how to query your Northwind graph database using Cypher, Neo4j's query language.

Cypher is a declarative language designed specifically for working with graph data. It uses ASCII-art patterns to express graph traversals intuitively.

In this module, you will:

* Learn the basics of Cypher syntax
* Read and return nodes and relationships
* Match patterns in the graph
* Filter results with WHERE clauses
* Aggregate data for analysis
* Answer business questions about Northwind data

If you are ready, let's get going!
