# Workshop Review Summary

## Comprehensive Review Completed

All 21 lessons in the Northwind Import Workshop have been reviewed and polished according to GraphAcademy .cursor rules.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Formatting (All 21 lessons)
- ✅ **Opening Structure**: Added proper two-part pattern (context + learning objective)
- ✅ **AsciiDoc Spacing**: Implemented TWO line breaks between all elements
- ✅ **Slides Markup**: Added `[.slide]` and `[.slide.discrete]` markers throughout
- ✅ **Summary Sections**: Added `[.summary]` markers to all summary blocks
- ✅ **Headers**: Converted markdown headers (##, ###) to AsciiDoc (==, ===)
- ✅ **Code Blocks**: Fixed all code block syntax to use AsciiDoc format
- ✅ **Bold/Emphasis**: Changed `**` to `*` for AsciiDoc compatibility

### 2. Content Quality
- ✅ **Tone**: Updated to "you will" language (removed "we will", "you'll")
- ✅ **Context Flow**: Each lesson references previous lesson appropriately
- ✅ **Clarity**: Removed sales language, fluff, and transformational phrases
- ✅ **Action-Oriented**: Made all headers action-oriented and in sentence case

### 3. Diagram Management
**Commented Out (25+ diagrams):**
- Process flowcharts (import process, tool workflows)
- UI navigation diagrams (accessing tools, clicking buttons)
- Conceptual hierarchies (benefits, decision trees)
- Statistical/comparison diagrams

**Kept (10 diagrams):**
