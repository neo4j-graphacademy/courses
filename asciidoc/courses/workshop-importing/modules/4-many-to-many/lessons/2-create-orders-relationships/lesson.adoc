== Complete the Customer→Product Path

You learned how pivot tables become relationships. Now you will transform the `order_details` table into CONTAINS relationships.

In this challenge, you will complete the critical path needed for product recommendations: Customer→Order→Product.


[.slide]
== Downloading the order_details CSV

Download the pivot table data:

* link:https://data.neo4j.com/northwind/order-details.csv[order-details.csv^] (2,155 order line items)

**What's in this file?**

* `orderID` - Foreign key to orders table
* `productID` - Foreign key to products table
* `quantity` - How many units ordered
* `unitPrice` - Price per unit (may differ from product's list price due to discounts)

**This entire file will become relationships!**


[.slide]
== Opening data importer

Open the Data Importer tool. You should see your existing model:

```
[Customer] -[:PLACED]-> [Order]

[Product]
```

You're about to connect Order to Product.


[.slide]
== Uploading order-details.csv

1. Click *Add Data Source*
2. Upload `order-details.csv`
3. Preview the data - notice it has NO entity data, only connection data
4. Click *Continue*

**Important:** This CSV doesn't create nodes - it only creates relationships!


[.slide]
== Creating CONTAINS relationship

Now create the relationship from Order to Product:

1. Click on the **Order** node
2. Drag from Order to Product (or click *Add Relationship*)
3. A relationship line appears between them


[.slide]
== Configuring the relationship

In the relationship details panel:

**1. Set the type:**
   - Type: `CONTAINS` (verb, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)

**2. Map from file:**
   - From file: `order-details.csv`

**3. Configure the connection:**
   - **From:** Order node, using `orderId` property
   - **Match to CSV column:** `orderID`
   - **To:** Product node, using `productId` property
   - **Match to CSV column:** `productID`

**What this means:**

For each row in order-details.csv:
* Find the Order with matching `orderId`
* Find the Product with matching `productId`
* Create a CONTAINS relationship between them


[.slide]
== Adding relationship properties

The relationship needs properties for quantity and price:

In the relationship properties section:

1. Add property: `quantity`
   - Source column: `quantity`
   - Type: Integer

2. Add property: `unitPrice`
   - Source column: `unitPrice`
   - Type: Float

**Why on the relationship?**

* `quantity` belongs to THIS connection (Order 10248 ordered 12 units of Chai)
* Can't store on Order (which product's quantity?)
* Can't store on Product (which order's quantity?)
* **Perfect for relationship properties!**


[NOTE]
.Storing Data on Relationships
====
Relationship properties let you store data about the connection itself:

* Order→Product: quantity, unitPrice, discount
* Person→Movie: rating, reviewDate
* Customer→Store: loyaltyPoints, memberSince

This eliminates the need for pivot tables entirely!

[.slide]
== Reviewing your complete model

Your canvas should now show:

```
[Customer] -[:PLACED]-> [Order] -[:CONTAINS {quantity, unitPrice}]-> [Product]
```

**This is the complete path for recommendations!**


[.slide]
== Running the import

1. Click *Run Import*
2. The tool will create **2,155 CONTAINS relationships**
3. Each relationship has quantity and unitPrice properties
4. Wait for completion

== Summary

In this challenge, you transformed the pivot table into relationships:

* **Downloaded** order-details.csv with 2,155 rows (the entire pivot table)
* **Created** CONTAINS relationships from Order to Product (2,155 relationships)
* **Added** relationship properties - quantity (Integer) and unitPrice (Float)
* **Eliminated** the need for a pivot table - relationships store the connection data
* **Completed** the Customer→Order→Product path (two-hop traversal)
* **Tested** multi-hop queries - from customer to products without JOINs
* **Queried** relationship properties - aggregated quantities and prices

The pivot table is now gone - transformed into direct graph relationships. This is THE key advantage of graph databases for many-to-many relationships.

In the next lesson, you will learn about multi-hop traversals and see how they compare to complex SQL queries.
