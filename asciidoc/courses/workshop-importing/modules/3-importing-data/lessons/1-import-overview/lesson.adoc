= Importing data into Neo4j
:type: lesson
:order: 1

[.slide.discrete]
== Module overview

You have created your Neo4j Aura instance and learned how to model graph data in Module 2. To build the Northwind graph database, you need to import the CSV data into Neo4j.


In this lesson, you will learn about different data import options in Neo4j and when to use each approach.


[.slide]
== Understanding data importing

Importing data means transforming data from one format (CSV files) into Neo4j's graph structure (nodes, relationships, and properties).


//TODO: Add image from importing-fundamentals showing CSV to Graph transformation
//Image should show CSV files being transformed into a graph structure


[.slide]
== The Northwind CSV files

The Northwind dataset is provided as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files:


* `customers.csv` - Customer information
* `orders.csv` - Order details
* `products.csv` - Product catalog
* `categories.csv` - Product categories
* `suppliers.csv` - Supplier information
* `employees.csv` - Employee data
* `order-details.csv` - Products in each order (join table)


//```mermaid
//graph TB
//    A[CSV Files] --> B[customers.csv]
//    A --> C[orders.csv]
//    A --> D[products.csv]
//    A --> E[categories.csv]
//    A --> F[suppliers.csv]
//    A --> G[employees.csv]
//    A --> H[order-details.csv]
//```

=== Import options in Neo4j

Neo4j provides several ways to import data:


//```mermaid
//flowchart TD
//    A[Import Methods] --> B[Data Importer]
//    A --> C[Cypher LOAD CSV]
//    A --> D[Neo4j Admin Import]
//    A --> E[Drivers/Application Code]
//    A --> F[ETL Tools]
//
//    B --> G[Visual, GUI-based]
//    C --> H[Code-based, flexible]
//    D --> I[Bulk, initial load]
//    E --> J[Programmatic]
//    F --> K[Enterprise pipelines]
//```


[.slide.discrete]
=== 1. Data Importer (what you will use)

*Best for:* Visual, interactive imports from CSV files


*Pros:*


* No coding required
* Visual data model design
* Point-and-click interface
* Perfect for learning and small datasets
* Built into Aura console


*Cons:*


* Limited to CSV files
* Not automated
* Best for initial loads, not ongoing updates


[.slide.discrete]
=== 2. Cypher LOAD CSV

*Best for:* Scripted imports with custom logic


*Pros:*


* Flexible and powerful
* Can handle complex transformations
* Works with any CSV source (URLs, files)
* Good for medium datasets


*Cons:*


* Requires Cypher knowledge
* Can be slower for very large datasets
* Need to handle batching manually


[.slide.discrete]
=== 3. Neo4j Admin import tool

*Best for:* Initial bulk loads of massive datasets


*Pros:*


* Extremely fast
* Handles billions of nodes/relationships
* Command-line tool


*Cons:*


* Only for initial import (empty database)
* More complex setup
* Not available in Aura Free


[.slide.discrete]
=== 4. Application code (drivers)

*Best for:* Real-time imports, ongoing synchronization


*Pros:*


* Full programmatic control
* Can integrate with existing systems
* Good for continuous imports


*Cons:*


* Requires development effort
* More complex error handling


[.slide]
== Your import strategy

The *Data Importer* is a good choice for this task because:


* It's visual and easy to learn
* Perfect for CSV files
* Built into Aura
* No coding required
* Great for datasets of this size


[.slide]
== The import process

Here's what you will do in the following lessons:


//```mermaid
//flowchart TD
//    A[1. Upload CSV Files] --> B[2. Create Node Mappings]
//    B --> C[3. Map Properties]
//    C --> D[4. Create Relationships]
//    D --> E[5. Add Constraints & Indexes]
//    E --> F[6. Run Import]
//    F --> G[7. Verify Data]
//```


1. *Upload CSV files* to Data Importer
2. *Create node labels* (Customer, Product, Order, etc.)
3. *Map CSV columns* to node properties
4. *Create relationships* between nodes
5. *Add constraints* for unique IDs and indexes for performance
6. *Run the import* to create the graph
7. *Verify* the data loaded correctly


[.slide]
== What to expect

By the end of this module, you will have:


* All Northwind nodes created (customers, orders, products, etc.)
* All relationships established (PLACED, ORDERS, PART_OF, etc.)
* Constraints ensuring data integrity
* Indexes for query performance
* A complete, queryable Northwind graph


```mermaid
graph TB
    Customer -->|PLACED| Order
    Order -->|ORDERS| Product
    Product -->|PART_OF| Category
    Product -->|SUPPLIED_BY| Supplier
    Employee -->|SOLD| Order
    Employee -->|REPORTS_TO| Employee
```


[.summary]
== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about importing data into Neo4j:


* **Data importing** - Transforming CSV files into Neo4j's graph structure (nodes, relationships, and properties)
* **Northwind dataset** - Consists of seven CSV files (customers, orders, products, categories, suppliers, employees, and order-details)
* **Import options** - Data Importer (visual, no coding), LOAD CSV (scripted), Admin Import (bulk loads), and Application Drivers (programmatic)
* **Data Importer benefits** - Visual interface, no coding required, perfect for CSV files and learning
* **Import process** - Upload files, create nodes, map properties, create relationships, add constraints/indexes, run import, and verify data


In the next lesson, you will explore the Data Importer tool and learn how to use it.
