== Importing Data into Neo4j

Now that you understand graph data modeling, it's time to import the Northwind dataset into your Neo4j Aura instance.

**Importing data** means transforming data from one format (CSV files) into Neo4j's graph structure (nodes, relationships, properties).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[CSV Files] -->|Transform| B[Neo4j Graph]
    
    C[customers.csv] --> B
    D[products.csv] --> B
    E[orders.csv] --> B
```

== The Northwind CSV Files

The Northwind dataset is provided as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files:

* `customers.csv` - Customer information
* `orders.csv` - Order details
* `products.csv` - Product catalog
* `categories.csv` - Product categories
* `suppliers.csv` - Supplier information
* `employees.csv` - Employee data
* `order-details.csv` - Products in each order (join table)

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[CSV Files] --> B[customers.csv]
    A --> C[orders.csv]
    A --> D[products.csv]
    A --> E[categories.csv]
    A --> F[suppliers.csv]
    A --> G[employees.csv]
    A --> H[order-details.csv]
```

## Import Options in Neo4j

Neo4j provides several ways to import data:

```mermaid

    A[Import Methods] --> B[Data Importer]
    A --> C[Cypher LOAD CSV]
    A --> D[Neo4j Admin Import]
    A --> E[Drivers/Application Code]
    A --> F[ETL Tools]
    
    B --> G[Visual, GUI-based]
    C --> H[Code-based, flexible]
    D --> I[Bulk, initial load]
    E --> J[Programmatic]
    F --> K[Enterprise pipelines]
```

### 1. Data Importer (What We'll Use)

**Best for:** Visual, interactive imports from CSV files

**Pros:**
* No coding required
* Visual data model design
* Point-and-click interface
* Perfect for learning and small datasets
* Built into Aura console

**Cons:**
* Limited to CSV files
* Not automated
* Best for initial loads, not ongoing updates

### 2. Cypher LOAD CSV

**Best for:** Scripted imports with custom logic

**Pros:**
* Flexible and powerful
* Can handle complex transformations
* Works with any CSV source (URLs, files)
* Good for medium datasets

**Cons:**
* Requires Cypher knowledge
* Can be slower for very large datasets
* Need to handle batching manually

### 3. Neo4j Admin Import Tool

**Best for:** Initial bulk loads of massive datasets

**Pros:**
* Extremely fast
* Handles billions of nodes/relationships
* Command-line tool

**Cons:**
* Only for initial import (empty database)
* More complex setup
* Not available in Aura Free

### 4. Application Code (Drivers)

**Best for:** Real-time imports, ongoing synchronization

**Pros:**
* Full programmatic control
* Can integrate with existing systems
* Good for continuous imports

**Cons:**
* Requires development effort
* More complex error handling

## Our Import Strategy

For this workshop, we'll use the **Data Importer** because:

✓ It's visual and easy to learn  
✓ Perfect for CSV files  
✓ Built into Aura  
✓ No coding required  
✓ Great for the Northwind dataset size

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[CSV Files] --> B[Data Importer]
    B --> C[Define Model]
    C --> D[Map Properties]
    D --> E[Run Import]
    E --> F[Northwind Graph Created!]
```

## The Import Process

Here's what we'll do in the following lessons:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[1. Upload CSV Files] --> B[2. Create Node Mappings]
    B --> C[3. Map Properties]
    C --> D[4. Create Relationships]
    D --> E[5. Add Constraints & Indexes]
    E --> F[6. Run Import]
    F --> G[7. Verify Data]
```

1. **Upload CSV files** to Data Importer
2. **Create node labels** (Customer, Product, Order, etc.)
3. **Map CSV columns** to node properties
4. **Create relationships** between nodes
5. **Add constraints** for unique IDs and indexes for performance
6. **Run the import** to create the graph
7. **Verify** the data loaded correctly

## What to Expect

By the end of this module, you'll have:

* All Northwind nodes created (customers, orders, products, etc.)
* All relationships established (PLACED, ORDERS, PART_OF, etc.)
* Constraints ensuring data integrity
* Indexes for query performance
* A complete, queryable Northwind graph!

```mermaid
graph TB
    Customer -->|PLACED| Order
    Order -->|ORDERS| Product
    Product -->|PART_OF| Category
    Product -->|SUPPLIED_BY| Supplier
    Employee -->|SOLD| Order
    Employee -->|REPORTS_TO| Employee
```

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned:

* What data importing means in Neo4j
* The Northwind CSV files structure
* Different import options (Data Importer, LOAD CSV, Admin Import, Drivers)
* Why we're using the Data Importer for this workshop
* The step-by-step import process we'll follow

In the next lesson, you will get hands-on with the Data Importer tool.
