= Modeling Relationships
:order: 3

In this module, you will learn about relationships and create your first connections in the graph.

You will import Customer and Order nodes and create PLACED relationships between them, enabling you to traverse from customers to their orders.

By the end of this module, you will see how graph traversals eliminate the need for JOINs.
