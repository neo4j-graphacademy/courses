.Hint
====
Follow the steps in this lesson to create IN_CATEGORY relationships.

Make sure to:

* Use `products.csv` which contains both productID and categoryID
* Create relationships (not nodes) with type `IN_CATEGORY`
* Match Product nodes using `productId`
* Match Category nodes using `categoryId`
* Set direction from Product to Category
* Click Run Import
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The IN_CATEGORY relationship should connect:

* **From:** Product node (using productId)
* **To:** Category node (using categoryId)
* **Relationship type:** `IN_CATEGORY`
* **CSV columns:** productID and categoryID from products.csv

After running the import, you should have 77 IN_CATEGORY relationships (one for each product).
