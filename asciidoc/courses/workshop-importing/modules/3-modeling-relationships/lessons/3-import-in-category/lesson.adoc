== Importing IN_CATEGORY relationships

You will create IN_CATEGORY relationships to connect products to their categories. These relationships enable category-based product recommendations.

== Data source

If you completed Module 2, you should already have Product and Category nodes in your graph. Use the button below to load the data model:

If you need to create Product and Category nodes, return to Module 2, Lessons 4 and 7.

You should see your existing nodes on the canvas.


[.slide]
== Create the IN_CATEGORY relationship

Drag from the Product node to the Category node:

1. Hover your mouse over the Product node - a grey circle with a green plus sign appears
2. Click and drag your mouse to the Category node to create the relationship


[.slide]
== Configure the relationship

In the **Definition tab** on the right:

1. **Set the type:** Enter `IN_CATEGORY` as the relationship type
2. **Select the table:** Under **Table**, select `products.csv`
3. **Configure From node:**
   - Node: Product
   - Property: id (the Product's ID property)
   - Column: `productID` (from products.csv)
4. **Configure To node:**
   - Node: Category
   - Property: id (the Category's ID property)
   - Column: `categoryID` (from products.csv)

.How Relationship Mapping Works
====
The products.csv file contains both `productID` and `categoryID` columns. The Data Importer uses these to match existing nodes and create relationships.

Each row in products.csv will create one IN_CATEGORY relationship.

[.slide]
== Run the import

Click the **Run Import** button to create the relationships. You will see a progress indicator while the import is running.

Once the import is complete, you will see a summary showing that **77 IN_CATEGORY relationships** were created.

== Summary

In this lesson, you created IN_CATEGORY relationships:

* **Created** IN_CATEGORY relationships from Product to Category (77 relationships)
* **Used** products.csv which contains both productID and categoryID
* **Configured** relationship type, direction, and mapping in the Definition tab
* **Dragged** from Product to Category to create the relationship line

Categories enable category-based recommendations, but are not required for the basic recommendation query.
