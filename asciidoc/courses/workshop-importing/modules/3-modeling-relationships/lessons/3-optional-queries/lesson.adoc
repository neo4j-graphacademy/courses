// Original content - practice queries for relationships

[.slide.discrete]
== Optional Practice

You have created the PLACED relationship between Customer and Order. You now have the data available to start querying the graph.

[.slide]
== Counting customer orders

Write a query to find how many orders customer ANTON has placed:

[source,cypher]
.Count orders for ANTON
----
MATCH (c:Customer {id: 'ANTON'})-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)  // <1>
RETURN c.name, count(o) AS orderCount;                   // <2>
----

<1> **Match pattern** - Find ANTON and traverse to orders
<2> **Count aggregation** - Count how many orders are connected

Click **Run** to see the result.

**Try experimenting:**

* Change 'ANTON' to 'ALFKI' to see a different customer
* Remove the WHERE to count orders for ALL customers: `MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order) RETURN c.name, count(o) ORDER BY count(o) DESC LIMIT 10;`


[.slide]
== Finding customers with many orders

Find customers who have placed more than 10 orders:

[source,cypher]
.Active customers (10+ orders)
----
MATCH (c:Customer)  // <1>
WITH c, COUNT { (c)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order) } AS orderCount // <2>
WHERE orderCount > 10                    // <3>
RETURN c.name, orderCount         // <4>
ORDER BY orderCount DESC;                // <5>
----

<1> **Match pattern** - Connect customers to their orders
<2> **Aggregate with WITH** - The `COUNT` sub-query finds the number of relationships by type and direction
<3> **Filter aggregation** - Only keep customers with more than 10 orders
<4> **Return results** - Show company name and order count
<5> **Sort** - Highest order counts first

Click **Run** to see your most active customers.


[.slide]
== Querying order date ranges

Find the date range of orders for a specific customer:

[source,cypher]
.Order history for ALFKI
----
MATCH (c:Customer {id: 'ALFKI'})-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)  // <1>
RETURN c.name,                                           // <2>
       min(o.date) AS firstOrder,                          // <3>
       max(o.date) AS lastOrder,                           // <4>
       count(o) AS totalOrders;                                 // <5>
----

<1> **Match pattern** - Find customer and their orders
<2> **Customer name** - Return the company name
<3> **Earliest order** - Use min() to find first order date
<4> **Latest order** - Use max() to find most recent order
<5> **Total count** - How many orders in this time range

Click **Run** to see ALFKI's ordering history.


[.slide]
== Grouping orders by country

Find how many orders were shipped to each country:

[source,cypher]
.Orders by ship country
----
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)  // <1>
RETURN o.shipCountry,                    // <2>
       count(o) AS orderCount            // <3>
ORDER BY orderCount DESC                 // <4>
LIMIT 10;                                // <5>
----

<1> **Match pattern** - Connect customers to orders
<2> **Group by country** - Implicitly groups by shipCountry
<3> **Count orders** - Aggregate per country
<4> **Sort descending** - Highest counts first
<5> **Limit** - Top 10 countries

Click **Run** to see which countries receive the most orders.


[.slide]
== Finding customers without orders

Find customers who haven't placed any orders yet:

[source,cypher]
.Customers with no orders
----
MATCH (c:Customer)                       // <1>
WHERE NOT (c)-[:PLACED]->(:Order)        // <2>
RETURN c.name, c.country;         // <3>
----

<1> **Match all customers** - Find every Customer node
<2> **Negative pattern** - Filter to only customers WITHOUT PLACED relationships
<3> **Return customer info** - Show who they are

Click **Run** to find customers who need outreach!


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The `WHERE NOT` pattern here accesses the data store directly to find a count of the number of `PLACED` relationships, which is fast and efficient.
You'll use negative patterns (`WHERE NOT`) in the recommendation query to exclude products you've already bought.

[.summary]
== Summary

In this lesson, you practiced relationship traversal queries:

* **Basic traversals** - Follow PLACED relationships from Customer to Order
* **Aggregation** - Count orders per customer with count()
* **Date functions** - min() and max() for date ranges
* **Grouping** - Implicit grouping by returned properties
* **Negative patterns** - Find customers _without_ orders using the `WHERE NOT` clause
* **Building blocks** - These patterns are foundations for the recommendation query

In the next module, you will add the critical Order→Product connection, completing the path needed for recommendations.
