== Optional Practice

You have imported Product and Category nodes. This optional lesson lets you practice writing Cypher queries to explore your data.

**Advanced learners:** Feel free to skip to the next module.

**Beginners:** Use these exercises to build confidence with Cypher before moving on.


[.slide]
== Practice Query 1: Filter by Price

Write a query to find expensive products:

[source,cypher]
.Find products that cost more than $50
----
MATCH (p:Product)
WHERE p.unitPrice > 50
RETURN p.productName, p.unitPrice
ORDER BY p.unitPrice DESC;
----

Click **Run** to see the results. You should find products like "Côte de Blaye" ($263.50) and "Thüringer Rostbratwurst" ($123.79).

**Try experimenting:**

* Change the threshold to $100
* Add a LIMIT to see only the top 3


[.slide]
== Practice Query 2: Count Products

Write a query to count how many products exist:

[source,cypher]
.Count all products
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN count(p) AS totalProducts;
----

You should see **77 products**.

**Try experimenting:**

* Count only discontinued products: `WHERE p.discontinued = true`
* Count products in stock: `WHERE p.unitsInStock > 0`


[.slide]
== Practice Query 3: Find Low Stock Products

Write a query to find products that need reordering:

[source,cypher]
.Find products with low stock
----
MATCH (p:Product)
WHERE p.unitsInStock < p.reorderLevel
  AND p.discontinued = false
RETURN p.productName, p.unitsInStock, p.reorderLevel
ORDER BY p.unitsInStock ASC;
----

This query combines multiple conditions:

* Stock is below reorder level
* Product is not discontinued
* Results sorted by stock level (lowest first)


[.slide]
== Practice Query 4: Most Expensive Products

Write a query to find the top 5 most expensive products:

[source,cypher]
.Top 5 most expensive products
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN p.productName, p.unitPrice
ORDER BY p.unitPrice DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

**Try experimenting:**

* Find the 5 cheapest products (change DESC to ASC)
* Find products between $20 and $50


[.slide]
== Practice Query 5: Explore Categories

Now that you've imported categories, try querying them:

[source,cypher]
.List all category names
----
MATCH (c:Category)
RETURN c.categoryName, c.description
ORDER BY c.categoryName;
----

You should see 8 categories including "Beverages", "Condiments", "Confections", etc.


[.slide]
== Challenge: Write Your Own Queries

Try writing queries to answer these questions:

**About Products:**
1. How many products have no units in stock?
2. What is the average price of all products?
3. Which products have never been discontinued?
4. Find products with "Chef Anton" in the name

**About Categories:**
5. How many categories exist?
6. Find the category with "Dairy" in the name

**Hints:**

* Use `count(p)` to count
* Use `avg(p.unitPrice)` for average
* Use `CONTAINS` for text search: `WHERE p.productName CONTAINS 'Chef Anton'`


[.summary]
== Summary

In this optional lesson, you practiced writing Cypher queries:

* **Filtering** - Use WHERE to filter by price, stock, or status
* **Counting** - Use count() to aggregate
* **Ordering** - Use ORDER BY to sort results
* **Limiting** - Use LIMIT to restrict results
* **Multiple conditions** - Combine WHERE clauses with AND/OR
* **Querying different labels** - Query both Products and Categories

These basic query patterns will be useful as you build more complex queries in the following modules.

**What you have so far:**

* 77 Product nodes
* 8 Category nodes
* The ability to query both node types

**What's missing:**

* Relationships connecting products to categories
* The ability to query "products IN a category"

In the next module, you will learn about relationships and start connecting your nodes.
