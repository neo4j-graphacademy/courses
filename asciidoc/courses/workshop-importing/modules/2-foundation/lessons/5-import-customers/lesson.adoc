// Updated - optional import of Customer nodes

[.slide.discrete]
== Importing Customer Nodes

You imported Product nodes in the previous lesson. Customer nodes represent the "me" in "people like me" for the recommendation algorithm.


In this lesson, you will import Customer nodes on your own using the same workflow you learned.


[.slide]
== The challenge

Import Customer nodes from the customers.csv file (already loaded in Data Importer).

**Success criteria:**

* ✅ Create nodes with the label `Customer`
* ✅ Map all columns to properties
* ✅ Set `customerId` as the unique identifier
* ✅ Verify you have 91 Customer nodes in your graph


[.slide]
== Using the data importer

The files are already loaded. Now map customers.csv to Customer nodes:

1. Open Import tool in Aura
2. Select `customers.csv` from the loaded files
3. Add a node with the label `Customer` (singular, PascalCase)
4. Map the CSV columns to properties:
   - `customerID` → `customerId` (String)
   - `companyName` → `companyName` (String)
   - `contactName` → `contactName` (String)
   - `contactTitle` → `contactTitle` (String)
   - `address` → `address` (String)
   - `city` → `city` (String)
   - `region` → `region` (String)
   - `postalCode` → `postalCode` (String)
   - `country` → `country` (String)
   - `phone` → `phone` (String)
   - `fax` → `fax` (String)
5. Set `customerId` as the ID property (click the key icon)
6. Run the import

**Expected result:** 91 Customer nodes created


[.slide]
== Verifying your work

After the import completes, validate with these queries:

**Query 1: Count customers**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)
RETURN count(c) AS customerCount;
----

**Expected result:** 91 customers


**Query 2: View sample customers**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)
RETURN c.customerId, c.companyName, c.country
ORDER BY c.companyName
LIMIT 5;
----

**Expected result:** You should see customers like ALFKI (Alfreds Futterkiste), ANATR, etc.


[.slide]
== Understanding why customers matter

Customers are the **"me"** in "people like me":

```
Customer -[:PLACED]-> Order -[:CONTAINS]-> Product
```

The recommendation algorithm finds:
1. What products **I** (a Customer) bought
2. Other **Customers** who bought the same products
3. What products **they** bought that I haven't

**Customers are essential for collaborative filtering!**


[.slide]
== Troubleshooting

**If you don't see 91 customers:**

* Make sure you selected customers.csv (not products or orders)
* Check that the label is `Customer` (singular, PascalCase)
* Verify the mapping includes customerId
* Re-run the import if needed

**If verification fails:**

* Open the Query tool
* Run the count query manually
* Check the Import tool for error messages


[.summary]
== Summary

In this optional challenge, you imported Customer nodes:

* **Selected** customers.csv from the loaded files
* **Created** Customer nodes with the Customer label
* **Mapped** CSV columns to properties (customerId, companyName, country, etc.)
* **Set** customerId as the unique identifier
* **Verified** the import with Cypher queries

**Key skill:** You can now import any node type using the Data Importer.

**This lesson is optional** - feel free to skip to Module 3 if you're ready to learn about relationships.

**Next:** Import Order nodes (Lesson 6) or skip to Module 3 to create relationships.
