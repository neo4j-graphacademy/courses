== Importing Customer Nodes

You imported Product nodes in the previous lesson. Now import Customer nodes using the same workflow.

In this challenge, you will work independently to import Customer nodes from the customers.csv file.

[.slide]
== File structure: customers.csv

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/northwind/customers.csv[customers.csv^] file contains customer information (click the filename to download if needed):

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type | Description
| customerID | String | Unique identifier for each customer (e.g., "ALFKI")
| companyName | String | Name of the customer company
| contactName | String | Primary contact person
| contactTitle | String | Title of the contact person
| address | String | Street address
| city | String | City name
| country | String | Country name
| phone | String | Phone number
|===

This file has **91 rows** - one for each customer company.

[.slide]
== Map the Customer node

In the **Data Modeling tab**:

. Select the **Define manually** option. This will open the data modeling canvas with a new node.
. **Set the label:** With the new node selected, under **Definition**, set the label to `Customer`
. **Select the table:** Under **Table**, select `customers.csv`


[.slide]
== Configure properties

Use the **Map from table** button to select the following columns. Verify their types and rename as applicable:

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type | Rename To
| customerID | String | id
| companyName | String | name
| contactName | String |
| country | String |
| city | String |

Verify the ID property is set to `id` and update if necessary.

== Run the import

Click the **Run Import** button to import the data. You will see a progress indicator while the import is running.

Once the import is complete, you will see a summary of the import, including the Cypher statements that were executed during the import process.
