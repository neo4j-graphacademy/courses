== Your Turn: Import Category Nodes

In the previous lesson, you followed along to import Product nodes. Now it's your turn to apply what you learned.

**In this challenge, you will independently import Category nodes.**

You will follow the same process, but this time without detailed step-by-step instructions.


[.slide]
== The Challenge

Import Category nodes from the provided CSV file into your Neo4j Aura instance.

**Success criteria:**

* ✅ Download and import the categories.csv file
* ✅ Create nodes with the label `Category`
* ✅ Map all columns to properties
* ✅ Set `categoryId` as the unique identifier
* ✅ Verify you have 8 Category nodes in your graph


[.slide]
== Step 1: Download the Data

Download the Categories CSV file:

* link:https://data.neo4j.com/northwind/categories.csv[categories.csv^]

**What's in this file?**

* 8 product categories from the Northwind catalog
* Columns: categoryID, categoryName, description


[.slide]
== Step 2: Import Using the Import Tool

Use the Import tool to import the categories:

1. Open Import (Import tab in Aura)
2. Upload the `categories.csv` file
3. Add a node with the label `Category` (singular, PascalCase)
4. Map the CSV columns to properties:
   - `categoryID` → `categoryId` (String)
   - `categoryName` → `categoryName` (String)
   - `description` → `description` (String)
5. Set `categoryId` as the ID property (click the key icon)
6. Run the import

**Tip:** Follow the same steps you used for Products in the previous lesson.


[.slide]
== Step 3: Verify Your Work

After the import completes, validate your work by running these queries in the Query tool.

**Query 1: Count categories**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Category)
RETURN count(c) AS categoryCount;
----

**Expected result:** 8 categories


**Query 2: View all categories**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Category)
RETURN c.categoryName, c.description
ORDER BY c.categoryName;
----

**Expected result:** You should see categories like "Beverages", "Condiments", "Confections", etc.


[.slide]
== Verify and Mark as Complete

verify::Check that Category nodes exist[]

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Category)
RETURN count(c) = 8 AS hasCategories;
----


[.slide]
== Troubleshooting

**If you don't see 8 categories:**

* Make sure you uploaded the correct CSV file
* Check that the label is `Category` (singular, PascalCase)
* Verify the mapping includes all three columns
* Re-run the import if needed

**If the verification fails:**

* Open the Query tool
* Run the count query manually
* Check the Import tool for any error messages


[.slide]
== Why Categories Matter

You now have two types of nodes in your graph:

* **77 Product nodes** - What customers buy
* **8 Category nodes** - How products are organized

**Next steps:**

In the upcoming modules, you will learn how to:

* Connect products to categories (relationships!)
* Query for "products in the Beverages category"
* Use categories to improve recommendations


[.summary]
== Summary

In this challenge, you independently imported Category nodes:

* **Downloaded** the categories.csv file
* **Used** the Import tool to create Category nodes
* **Mapped** CSV columns to properties
* **Set** categoryId as the unique identifier
* **Verified** the import with Cypher queries

**Key skill:** You can now import nodes into Neo4j using the Import tool.

In the next lesson, you can optionally practice more Cypher queries.
