== Importing Order Nodes

You imported Product and Customer nodes. Now import Order nodes using the same workflow.

In this challenge, you will work independently to import Order nodes from the orders.csv file.

[.slide]
== Map the Order node

In the **Data Modeling tab**:

. Select the **Define manually** option. This will open the data modeling canvas with a new node.
. **Set the label:** With the new node selected, under **Definition**, set the label to `Order`
. **Select the table:** Under **Table**, select `orders.csv`


[.slide]
== Configure properties

Use the **Map from table** button to select the following columns. Verify their types and rename as applicable:

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type | Rename To
| orderID | Integer | id
| orderDate | String | date
| shipCountry | String |
| shipCity | String |
|===

[NOTE]
.ID Property
====
The data importer will attempt to automatically select the ID property.

Verify the ID property is set to `id` and update if necessary.
====

[NOTE]
.Date Properties
====
The Data Importer does not currently support Date types. The `orderDate` field will be imported as a String and would need to be manually converted to a Date type using Cypher later on if date operations are required.
====


[.slide]
== Run the import

Click the **Run Import** button to import the data. You will see a progress indicator while the import is running.

Once the import is complete, you will see a summary of the import, including the Cypher statements that were executed during the import process.

You should see confirmation that **830 Order nodes** were created.
