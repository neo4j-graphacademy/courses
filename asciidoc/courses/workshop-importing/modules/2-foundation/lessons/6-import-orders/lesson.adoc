// New lesson - optional import of Order nodes

== Optional Practice - Import Order Nodes

**This lesson is optional.** If you're ready to learn about relationships, skip to Module 3.

In Lesson 4, you imported Product nodes. In Lesson 5, you imported Customer nodes. Now practice again by importing Order nodes independently.

**In this challenge, you will import Order nodes on your own.**


[.slide]
== The Challenge

Import Order nodes from the orders.csv file (already loaded in Data Importer).

**Success criteria:**

* ✅ Create nodes with the label `Order`
* ✅ Map all columns to properties
* ✅ Set `orderId` as the unique identifier
* ✅ Verify you have 830 Order nodes in your graph


[.slide]
== Step 1: Use the Data Importer

The files are already loaded. Now map orders.csv to Order nodes:

1. Open Import tool in Aura
2. Select `orders.csv` from the loaded files
3. Add a node with the label `Order` (singular, PascalCase)
4. Map the CSV columns to properties:
   - `orderID` → `orderId` (String)
   - `customerID` → `customerId` (String) - we'll use this to create PLACED relationships in Module 3
   - `employeeID` → `employeeId` (String)
   - `orderDate` → `orderDate` (String)
   - `requiredDate` → `requiredDate` (String)
   - `shippedDate` → `shippedDate` (String)
   - `shipVia` → `shipVia` (String)
   - `freight` → `freight` (Float)
   - `shipName` → `shipName` (String)
   - `shipAddress` → `shipAddress` (String)
   - `shipCity` → `shipCity` (String)
   - `shipRegion` → `shipRegion` (String)
   - `shipPostalCode` → `shipPostalCode` (String)
   - `shipCountry` → `shipCountry` (String)
5. Set `orderId` as the ID property (click the key icon)
6. Run the import

**Expected result:** 830 Order nodes created


[.slide]
== Step 2: Verify Your Work

After the import completes, validate with these queries:

**Query 1: Count orders**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Order)
RETURN count(o) AS orderCount;
----

**Expected result:** 830 orders


**Query 2: View sample orders**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Order)
RETURN o.orderId, o.orderDate, o.shipCountry
ORDER BY o.orderDate
LIMIT 5;
----

**Expected result:** You should see orders with dates and ship countries


[.slide]
== Why Orders Matter

Orders are the **connection point** in your graph model:

```
Customer -[:PLACED]-> Order -[:CONTAINS]-> Product
```

* **Customer PLACED Order** - who bought
* **Order CONTAINS Product** - what was bought

In Module 3, you'll create the PLACED relationships connecting Customers to Orders.

In Module 4, you'll create the CONTAINS relationships connecting Orders to Products.

**Orders are the bridge that completes the recommendation path!**


[.slide]
== Troubleshooting

**If you don't see 830 orders:**

* Make sure you selected orders.csv (not products or customers)
* Check that the label is `Order` (singular, PascalCase)
* Verify the mapping includes orderId
* Re-run the import if needed

**If verification fails:**

* Open the Query tool
* Run the count query manually
* Check the Import tool for error messages


[.summary]
== Summary

In this optional challenge, you imported Order nodes:

* **Selected** orders.csv from the loaded files
* **Created** Order nodes with the Order label
* **Mapped** CSV columns to properties (orderId, orderDate, shipCountry, etc.)
* **Set** orderId as the unique identifier
* **Verified** the import with Cypher queries

**Key skill:** You can now import any node type using the Data Importer.

**This lesson is optional** - feel free to skip to Module 3 if you're ready to learn about relationships.

In Module 3, you will create PLACED relationships connecting Customers to Orders.
