== Guided Import: Product Nodes

You learned how the Import tool works. Now you will use it to import your first nodes.

**In this lesson, you will follow along as we walk through each step together.**

You will import Product nodes from a CSV file. The next lesson will ask you to do this independently with a different node type.


[.slide]
== Step 1: Download the CSV File

Download the Products CSV file:

* link:https://data.neo4j.com/northwind/products.csv[products.csv^]

Save the file to your local machine.

**What's in this file?**

* 77 products from the Northwind catalog
* Columns: productID, productName, unitPrice, quantityPerUnit, unitsInStock, unitsOnOrder, reorderLevel, discontinued

== Step 2: Open Import

[.col]
====
In your Aura instance:

1. Click *Import* from the left navigation
2. The Import tool will open
3. You'll see an empty canvas where you'll design your graph model
====

[.slide.col-2.reverse]
== Step 3: Upload the CSV

[.col]
====
1. Click *Add Data Source* or drag the CSV file onto the canvas
2. Select `products.csv` from your computer
3. The tool will preview the first few rows
4. Click *Continue* to proceed

[.slide.col-2.reverse]
== Step 4: Create a Product Node

[.col]
====
1. The tool prompts you to *Add a node*
2. Click *Add Node*
3. In the details panel on the right:
   - Set the label to `Product` (PascalCase, singular)
   - The node appears on the canvas

== Step 5: Map CSV to Properties

[.col]
====
1. Click *Map from file*
2. Select `products.csv`
3. The tool suggests property mappings
4. Review the mappings:
   - `productID` → `productId` (String)
   - `productName` → `productName` (String)
   - `unitPrice` → `unitPrice` (Float)
   - `quantityPerUnit` → `quantityPerUnit` (String)
   - `unitsInStock` → `unitsInStock` (Integer)
   - `unitsOnOrder` → `unitsOnOrder` (Integer)
   - `reorderLevel` → `reorderLevel` (Integer)
   - `discontinued` → `discontinued` (Boolean)
====

[NOTE]
.Property Types
====
The Import tool auto-detects types:

* **String** - Text values (productName, productId)
* **Integer** - Whole numbers (unitsInStock)
* **Float** - Decimal numbers (unitPrice)
* **Boolean** - true/false (discontinued)

If a type is wrong, you can change it in the property list.
====


[.slide.col-2.reverse]
== Step 6: Set the ID Property

[.col]
====
1. Find the `productId` property in the list
2. Click the key icon next to it
3. This marks `productId` as the unique identifier

**Why?** The ID property ensures each product is unique and enables efficient lookups.
====

[.slide.col-2.reverse]
== Step 7: Run the Import

[.col]
====
1. Click *Run Import* in the top right
2. The tool executes the import
3. You'll see a progress indicator
4. When complete, you'll see: **"77 nodes created"**
====

[.slide]
== Step 8: Validate Your Import

Open the *Query* tool and run this query to verify your products were imported:

[source,cypher]
.Count all products
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN count(p) AS productCount;
----

You should see **77 products**.

Now view the first 5 products:

[source,cypher]
.View first 5 products
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN p.productName, p.unitPrice, p.unitsInStock
LIMIT 5;
----

You should see results similar to:

[options="header", cols="2,1,1"]
|===
| productName | unitPrice | unitsInStock

| Chai | 18.00 | 39
| Chang | 19.00 | 17
| Aniseed Syrup | 10.00 | 13
| Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning | 22.00 | 53
| Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix | 21.35 | 0
|===

**✅ Success!** You have imported your first nodes.


[.slide]
== Building Block #1 Complete

You now have **Product nodes** in your graph - the first piece of the recommendation system.

**What you can do so far:**

* Query for products by name
* Filter products by price
* Find products in stock

**What you can't do yet:**

* Connect products to orders (no relationships yet)
* Connect products to customers (no relationships yet)
* Make recommendations (need the complete Customer→Product path)

In the next module, you will add the relationships that enable these queries.


[.summary]
== Summary

In this challenge, you imported Product nodes:

* **Downloaded** the products.csv file with 77 products
* **Opened** Data Importer in your Aura instance
* **Uploaded** the CSV file and previewed the data
* **Created** a Product node with the Product label
* **Mapped** CSV columns to node properties (productName, unitPrice, etc.)
* **Set** productId as the unique identifier
* **Ran** the import and created 77 Product nodes
* **Validated** the import with Cypher queries

You now have the foundation of your graph - products are what you will recommend.

In the next lesson, you will import another node type independently - applying what you learned here.
