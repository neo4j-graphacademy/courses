// Updated - optional import of Customer nodes

== Import Customer Nodes

**This lesson is optional.** If you're comfortable with the Data Importer, skip to Module 3.

In Lesson 4, you imported Product nodes. Now practice importing Customer nodes independently - these are the "me" in "people like me."

**In this challenge, you will import Customer nodes on your own.**


[.slide]
== The Challenge

Import Customer nodes from the customers.csv file (already loaded in Data Importer).

**Success criteria:**

* ✅ Create nodes with the label `Customer`
* ✅ Map all columns to properties
* ✅ Set `customerId` as the unique identifier
* ✅ Verify you have 91 Customer nodes in your graph


[.slide]
== Step 1: Use the Data Importer

The files are already loaded. Now map customers.csv to Customer nodes:

1. Open Import tool in Aura
2. Select `customers.csv` from the loaded files
3. Add a node with the label `Customer` (singular, PascalCase)
4. Map the CSV columns to properties:
   - `customerID` → `customerId` (String)
   - `companyName` → `companyName` (String)
   - `contactName` → `contactName` (String)
   - `contactTitle` → `contactTitle` (String)
   - `address` → `address` (String)
   - `city` → `city` (String)
   - `region` → `region` (String)
   - `postalCode` → `postalCode` (String)
   - `country` → `country` (String)
   - `phone` → `phone` (String)
   - `fax` → `fax` (String)
5. Set `customerId` as the ID property (click the key icon)
6. Run the import

**Expected result:** 91 Customer nodes created


[.slide]
== Step 2: Verify Your Work

After the import completes, validate with these queries:

**Query 1: Count customers**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)
RETURN count(c) AS customerCount;
----

**Expected result:** 91 customers


**Query 2: View sample customers**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)
RETURN c.customerId, c.companyName, c.country
ORDER BY c.companyName
LIMIT 5;
----

**Expected result:** You should see customers like ALFKI (Alfreds Futterkiste), ANATR, etc.


[.slide]
== Why Customers Matter

Customers are the **"me"** in "people like me":

```
Customer -[:PLACED]-> Order -[:CONTAINS]-> Product
```

The recommendation algorithm finds:
1. What products **I** (a Customer) bought
2. Other **Customers** who bought the same products
3. What products **they** bought that I haven't

**Customers are essential for collaborative filtering!**


[.slide]
== Troubleshooting

**If you don't see 91 customers:**

* Make sure you selected customers.csv (not products or orders)
* Check that the label is `Customer` (singular, PascalCase)
* Verify the mapping includes customerId
* Re-run the import if needed

**If verification fails:**

* Open the Query tool
* Run the count query manually
* Check the Import tool for error messages


[.summary]
== Summary

In this optional challenge, you imported Customer nodes:

* **Selected** customers.csv from the loaded files
* **Created** Customer nodes with the Customer label
* **Mapped** CSV columns to properties (customerId, companyName, country, etc.)
* **Set** customerId as the unique identifier
* **Verified** the import with Cypher queries

**Key skill:** You can now import any node type using the Data Importer.

**This lesson is optional** - feel free to skip to Module 3 if you're ready to learn about relationships.

**Next:** Import Order nodes (Lesson 6) or skip to Module 3 to create relationships.
