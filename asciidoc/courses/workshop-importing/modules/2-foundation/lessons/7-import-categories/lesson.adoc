// Moved from Module 7 - optional import of Category nodes

== Import Category Nodes

**This lesson is optional.** Categories are used for enriching recommendations but aren't required for the basic recommendation query.

You've now imported Products, Customers, and Orders. Practice one more time by importing Category nodes independently.

**In this challenge, you will import Category nodes on your own.**


[.slide]
== The Challenge

Import Category nodes from the categories.csv file (already loaded in Data Importer).

**Success criteria:**

* ✅ Create nodes with the label `Category`
* ✅ Map all columns to properties
* ✅ Set `categoryId` as the unique identifier
* ✅ Verify you have 8 Category nodes in your graph


[.slide]
== Step 1: Use the Data Importer

The files are already loaded. Now map categories.csv to Category nodes:

1. Open Import tool in Aura
2. Select `categories.csv` from the loaded files
3. Add a node with the label `Category` (singular, PascalCase)
4. Map the CSV columns to properties:
   - `categoryID` → `categoryId` (String)
   - `categoryName` → `categoryName` (String)
   - `description` → `description` (String)
5. Set `categoryId` as the ID property (click the key icon)
6. Run the import

**Expected result:** 8 Category nodes created


[.slide]
== Step 2: Verify Your Work

After the import completes, validate with these queries:

**Query 1: Count categories**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Category)
RETURN count(c) AS categoryCount;
----

**Expected result:** 8 categories


**Query 2: View all categories**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Category)
RETURN c.categoryName, c.description
ORDER BY c.categoryName;
----

**Expected result:** You should see categories like "Beverages", "Condiments", "Confections", etc.


[.slide]
== Why Categories Matter (Optional)

Categories enable richer recommendations:

```
Product -[:IN_CATEGORY]-> Category
```

**Without categories:**
* "Customers like you bought Chai"

**With categories (optional enrichment):**
* "Customers like you bought products from Beverages category"
* "Try these other Beverages products"

You can create IN_CATEGORY relationships later if you want category-based recommendations.


[.slide]
== Troubleshooting

**If you don't see 8 categories:**

* Make sure you selected categories.csv
* Check that the label is `Category` (singular, PascalCase)
* Verify the mapping includes all three columns
* Re-run the import if needed

**If verification fails:**

* Open the Query tool
* Run the count query manually
* Check the Import tool for error messages


[.summary]
== Summary

In this optional challenge, you imported Category nodes:

* **Selected** categories.csv from the loaded files
* **Created** Category nodes with the Category label
* **Mapped** CSV columns to properties
* **Set** categoryId as the unique identifier
* **Verified** the import with Cypher queries

**This lesson is optional** - categories enrich recommendations but aren't required for the basic query.

In Module 3, you will create relationships to build the recommendation path.
