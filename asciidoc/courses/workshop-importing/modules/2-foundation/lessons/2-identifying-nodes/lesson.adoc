== Introduction

So far, you have learned the elements of a graph, and how to query across them using Cypher. Before you can import data, you need to identify what should be a node in your graph model.

In this lesson, you will learn the decision criteria for identifying nodes and why products are nodes in the Northwind model.

== What Makes Something a Node?

**Nodes represent entities** - things that exist independently and have their own identity and data.

**Think of nodes as nouns** - they are the "things" in your domain (Customer, Product, Order), not the actions or connections between them.

Ask these questions:

* **Is it a distinct entity?** Does it represent something with its own identity, rather than just a property or connection?
* **Does it have its own properties?** Does it store data that describes itself?
* **Will you query it directly?** Will you search for it or filter by it?
* **Does it connect to other things?** Does it have relationships?

If you answer "yes" to most of these, it should be a node.



[.slide]
== The Northwind Entities as Nodes

Based on the decision criteria, these Northwind entities are nodes:

* **Product** - Items for sale (what we're recommending)
* **Customer** - Companies that buy products (the "me" in "people like me")
* **Order** - Purchase orders (the connection between customers and products)
* **Category** - Product groupings
* **Supplier** - Companies that provide products

Each of these entities exists independently, has its own properties and relationships to other entities.

[.slide]
== Why Products are Nodes

**Product** is a node in Northwind because:

* **Distinct entity** - Products are "things" with their own identity (Chai, Tofu, etc.), not just attributes of orders
* **Own properties** - Each product has `productName`, `unitPrice`, `quantityPerUnit`, stock levels
* **Direct queries** - You search for products: "What products cost more than $50?"
* **Connections** - Products are contained within Orders (which ones were purchased), organized into Categories (how they're grouped), and supplied by Suppliers (who provides them).

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to identify nodes:

* **Nodes represent entities** - Things with distinct identity, own properties, and relationships
* **Decision criteria** - Ask: distinct entity? Own properties? Direct queries? Connections?
* **Product is a node** - Has its own identity and data, queried directly, connects to orders/categories/suppliers
* **Not a property** - Entities shouldn't be properties if you need to query them or connect them to multiple things
* **Start with products** - The entities we're recommending are the foundation of the graph

In the next lesson, you will import your first Product nodes using the Data Importer tool.
