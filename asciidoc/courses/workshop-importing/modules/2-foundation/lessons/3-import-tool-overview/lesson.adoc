== The Import Tool

Now that you have identified nodes in the northwind dataset, you can use the **Import tool** to start to define your data model.

The Import tool provides a a visual tool that allows you to define your data model and import data into your graph database.

In this lesson, you will learn:

* How the Import tool is organized
* The workflow for importing data
* How mapping works regardless of data source


[.slide]
== What is the Import Tool?

The **Import** tool in Neo4j Aura helps you load data from various sources into your graph database without writing any code.

**Supported data sources:**

* Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
* Data warehouses (BigQuery, Databricks, Snowflake)
* Cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blobs & Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage)
* Local files (CSV)

**Key benefits:**

* **Visual** - Design your graph model with a drag-and-drop interface
* **No coding required** - Map tables and columns to graph elements without writing Cypher
* **Validated** - Preview your data before importing
* **Fast** - Optimized for bulk data loading

You'll find the Import tool in the left navigation of your Aura instance.


[.slide]
== Import Tool UI Overview

The Import tool consists of **three main tabs** that reflect the three stages of importing:

**1. Data Sources Tab**

* Connect to databases, data warehouses, or cloud storage
* Upload local files
* View table/file previews showing columns and sample data
* Manage multiple data sources for your import

**2. Graph Models Tab**

* Visual canvas where you design your graph model
* Create nodes and relationships
* Map tables/files to graph elements
* Configure properties and IDs

**3. Import Jobs Tab**

* View and manage import jobs
* Monitor import progress and results
* Review past imports and their status

The workflow moves through these tabs: **Data Sources** → **Graph Models** → **Import Jobs**


[.slide]
== The Import Workflow

Importing data follows three main stages:

**Stage 1: Provide the Data**

* Connect to your data source or upload files
* Configure connection settings (for databases/warehouses)
* Preview your tables/files to see columns and sample rows

**Stage 2: Model and Map the Data**

* Design your graph model on the canvas
* Add nodes and set labels
* Map tables/files to nodes
* Select columns to become properties and set ID fields

**Stage 3: Run the Import**

* Preview the import (optional but recommended)
* Execute the import to create nodes and relationships
* Review the results summary

Let's explore each stage in detail.


[.slide]
== Stage 1: Connecting to Data Sources

**For databases and data warehouses:**

1. Click **Add Data Source** in the Data Sources tab
2. Select your source type (PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, etc.)
3. Configure connection settings:
   - Host and port
   - Database/service name
   - Schema (where applicable)
4. Provide credentials
5. Test the connection

**For local files:**

1. Click **Add Data Source** or drag files onto the data source panel
2. Browse for files on your computer
3. Files are uploaded and listed

**Viewing your data:**

* Each table/file can be expanded to show columns and sample rows
* Use the dropdown arrow to preview contents
* Use the `...` menu to delete or manage sources


[.slide]
== Working in the Graph Models Tab

Once you have a data source connected, switch to the **Graph Models** tab to design your model.

**The canvas has three panels:**

**1. Data Source Panel (left)**

* Shows your connected tables/files
* Expand to preview columns and sample data
* Drag to reorder or manage sources

**2. Model Canvas (center)**

* Visual workspace for designing your graph
* Add nodes and relationships
* Position and organize your model

**3. Details Panel (right)**

* Configure selected elements
* Two tabs: Definition and Constraints & Indexes
* Map tables/files to graph elements


[.slide]
== Creating and Labeling Nodes

**How to create a node:**

1. Click the **Add Node** button (top left of canvas)
2. A node appears on the canvas
3. Type the label directly on the node, or use the **Label** field in the details panel

**Naming conventions:**

* Use **CamelCase** for labels: `Product`, `Category`, `OrderDetail`
* Use **singular** form: `Product` not `Products`
* Be descriptive and consistent

**Node requirements:**

Every node needs:

* A label
* A mapped table/file
* At least one property
* An ID property

The node shows a **green checkmark** when all requirements are met.


[.slide]
== Mapping Tables to Nodes

**How to map a table/file to a node:**

1. Select your node on the canvas
2. In the details panel, find the **File** dropdown under the Definition tab
3. Select the table/file to map to this node
4. Choose **Map properties from file** to auto-populate properties

**What happens:**

* The Import tool reads the table columns
* Each column can become a property
* Data types are automatically detected (String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Date)
* You can review and adjust the mappings

**Mapping workflow:**

This mapping process is the same regardless of whether your source is a database table or a file. The Import tool treats all sources uniformly once connected.


[.slide]
== Configuring Properties

Once a table/file is mapped, you'll see properties listed in the **Definition** tab of the details panel.

**For each property, you can:**

* **Rename** - Change the property name (e.g., `product_id` → `productId`)
* **Change type** - Adjust the data type from the dropdown
* **Toggle inclusion** - Check/uncheck to include or exclude from import
* **Set as ID** - Click the key icon to mark as the unique identifier

**Property naming conventions:**

* Use **camelCase** for properties: `productId`, `unitPrice`, `categoryName`

**Available data types:**

* **String** - Text values
* **Integer** - Whole numbers
* **Float** - Decimal numbers
* **Boolean** - true/false values
* **Date** - Date/datetime values


[.slide]
== The ID Property

**Every node MUST have a unique identifier.**

**How to set the ID:**

1. Find the column that uniquely identifies each row
2. Click the **key icon** next to that property in the property list
3. The property is marked with a key icon

**Why is this critical?**

* The ID ensures no duplicate nodes are created
* If a row with the same ID is seen again, its properties are updated (not duplicated)
* IDs are used to connect nodes when creating relationships
* A constraint is automatically created to enforce uniqueness

**Automatic ID selection:**

The Import tool attempts to automatically select columns with "id" in the name, but you should verify this is correct for your data.

**Common ID patterns:**

* Primary keys from database tables
* Unique identifiers like `productId`, `customerId`, `orderId`
* Natural keys that uniquely identify entities


[.slide]
== Stage 3: Previewing the Import

Before running the actual import, you should preview your data.

**How to preview:**

1. Click the **Preview** button dropdown (next to Run Import)
2. Choose **Preview all** or **Preview selected**
3. The preview shows a sample of your data as a graph

**What the preview shows:**

* A visual representation of sample nodes and relationships
* Only correctly mapped elements are shown
* Does NOT import actual data (safe to run multiple times)

**When to use preview:**

* To verify your model looks correct
* To check that properties are mapped as expected
* To catch issues before the actual import

**Note:** Preview uses only a sample of data, so it may look different from the full import in terms of size and connectedness.


[.slide]
== Running the Import

When you're ready to import your data:

**Prerequisites:**

* Ensure you're connected to your Aura instance (check the connection banner at the top)
* All elements in your model must have a green checkmark (complete mapping)

**How to run the import:**

1. Click **Run Import** button
2. The import runs in batches
3. Progress is shown as the import executes
4. The import can be stopped at any time if needed

**What happens during import:**

* A **constraint** is created to ensure ID uniqueness (one per node label)
* **Nodes** are created for each row in your source table/file
* **Properties** are set from the mapped columns
* The import is optimized for performance with batch processing

**When complete:**

You'll see a results summary showing nodes created, properties set, time elapsed, and data processed.


[.slide]
== Viewing Import Results

The results summary provides detailed information about what was imported.

**For nodes:**

* **Key statement** - Shows the constraint created for uniqueness
* **Load statement** - Shows the Cypher used to create nodes
* Count of nodes created
* Properties set

**For relationships (covered later):**

* **Load statement** - Shows the Cypher used to connect nodes
* Count of relationships created
* Properties set

**Viewing Cypher statements:**

You can expand each element in the results to see the generated Cypher. This provides insight into how the Import tool constructs statements, though these are not meant to be copied directly.


[.slide]
== Import Best Practices

**Before importing:**

* Review your source data for quality and completeness
* Identify unique identifiers in each table/file
* Plan your node labels and property names
* Understand the graph structure you're building

**During modeling:**

* Use descriptive, singular labels (`Product` not `products`)
* Follow naming conventions (CamelCase for labels, camelCase for properties)
* Set appropriate data types for properties
* Always verify the ID property is correct

**After import:**

* Verify the data with Cypher queries
* Check node counts match expected values
* Review the results summary for any warnings
* Test sample queries to ensure data is correct


[.slide]

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how the Import tool works:

* **Three-tab structure** - Data Sources, Graph Models, and Import Jobs
* **Data source options** - Databases, data warehouses, cloud storage, and local files
* **Three-stage workflow** - Provide data → Model and map → Run import
* **Graph modeling** - Create nodes on the canvas and set labels
* **Mapping process** - Connect tables/files to nodes, regardless of source type
* **Property configuration** - Select columns, rename properties, and set data types
* **ID property** - Every node must have a unique ID property for node identification
