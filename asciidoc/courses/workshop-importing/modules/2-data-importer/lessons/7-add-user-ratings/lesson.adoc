== Challenge

[.col]
====
In this challenge, you will add movie ratings to the graph.

You will create a new node for each `User` and a `RATED` relationship between the `User` and the `Movie` nodes.

[.slide.discrete]
== Data
The data for the node and relationship is stored in a single file, link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-fundamentals/ratings.csv[`ratings.csv`^], which contains the following columns:

* `movieId`: The ID of the movie that the user rated.
* `userId`: The user's ID.
* `name`: The user's name.
* `rating`: The user's rating of the movie.
* `timestamp`: The timestamp when the user created the rating.

The `User` node should have `userId` and `name` properties, and the `RATED` relationship should have `rating` and `timestamp` properties.

[.slide.discrete]
== Process
The process is the same as importing from a single file as it is from multiple files:

. Upload the link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-fundamentals/ratings.csv[`ratings.csv`^].
. Create the model for the data, in this case, a `User` node and a `RATED` relationship to the `Movie` node.
. Map the columns to the model. The node and the relationship will use the same `ratings.csv` file.
. Import the data.

You can check you have imported the data by running the following query to return `User` nodes and the `RATED` relationship:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN u,r,m
LIMIT 25

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to import multiple nodes and relationships from a single file.

In the next lesson, you will explore the considerations for using Data Importer.
