== Challenge

Your challenge is to import data about movies from a CSV file and create `Movie` nodes in the database.

To complete this challenge, you will need to:

. Download the link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-fundamentals/movies.csv[`movies.csv`^] file and import it into Data Importer
. Update the model to add a new Node label `Movie`
. Map the columns from the CSV file to the properties of the `Movie` node
. Run the import to create `Movie` nodes in the database

You can use the `movieId` as the unique identifier for the `Movie` nodes.
