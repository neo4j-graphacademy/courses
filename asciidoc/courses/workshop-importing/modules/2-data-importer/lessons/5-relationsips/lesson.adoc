== The ACTED_IN relationship

In this lesson, you will learn how to create relationships between nodes.

The `ACTED_IN` relationship connects a Person node to a Movie node. This relationship indicates that the person acted in the movie.

The relationship has a property called `role` that stores the name of the character a person played in the movie.

== Creating Relationships

The process for creating relationships is similar to creating nodes:

. Upload the data
. Create the relationship in the model
. Map the fields
. Run the import

[.slide]
== Upload the data

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-fundamentals/acted_in.csv[`acted_in.csv`^] file contains the data to match the `Person` nodes to the `Movie` nodes. 
The file contains the following columns:

* `movieId` - The unique identifier of the movie
* `person_tmdbId` - the unique identifier of the person
* `role` - the role the person played

Download the link:https://data.neo4j.com/importing-fundamentals/acted_in.csv[`acted_in.csv`^] file and upload it to Data Importer.

== Create the relationship

To create a relationship between nodes, hover over the edge of the start node, click, and drag the relationship to the end node.

== Create the relationship

To create the `ACTED_IN` relationship, you need to:

. Create a relationship between the `Person` and `Movie` nodes
. Set the relationship type to `ACTED_IN`
. Select the `acted_in.csv` file
. Set the Node ID mapping for the `Person` and `Movie` nodes:
+
|===
|  | Node | ID | ID column
| From | `Person` | `tmdbId` | `person_tmdbId`
| To | `Movie` | `movieId` | `movieId`
|===
. Map the `role` property from the file to the relationship

[TIP]
.Deleting relationships
=====
You can remove an unwanted relationship by selecting the relationship and pressing the delete key.

====

Once you have set up the relationship, you can run the import.

You can check that the `ACTED_IN` relationships have been created by running the following query to find the actors in the movie "Toy Story":

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
RETURN p,r,m

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create relationships between nodes.

In the next challenge, you will use what you have learned to import the `DIRECTED` relationship between `Person` and `Movie` nodes.
