== Introduction

You've completed the workshop! Let's review everything you learned, from setting up Aura to building production-ready recommendation queries.

In this lesson, you will review the key concepts, patterns, and techniques from each module.


[.slide]
== The Goal (Module 1)

**The question you set out to answer:**

> "What products do people like me buy, that I haven't bought yet?"

**What you built:**
* Complete graph data model
* Collaborative filtering algorithm
* Production-ready recommendation query
* 80x faster than SQL equivalent

**You did it!**


[.slide]
== Module 1: Aura Setup

**What you learned:**
* Neo4j Aura platform
* Data Importer tool (source of truth for import mechanics)
* Query tool for running Cypher
* Explore tool for graph visualization

**Key takeaway:** Module 1 Lesson 3 taught HOW to import. Later modules focused on WHAT and WHY.


[.slide]
== Module 2: Foundation

**What you learned:**
* Graph elements: nodes, relationships, properties, labels
* Cypher basics: MATCH, RETURN, WHERE, ORDER BY
* Node identification criteria
* Imported Product nodes

**Key concept:** Products are nodes because they're distinct entities with properties, queryable, and connected to other things.

**Building block 1:** Products exist in the graph


[.slide]
== Module 3: Basic Relationships

**What you learned:**
* Relationships connect nodes (type, direction, properties)
* Foreign keys → relationships transformation
* Imported Customers and Orders
* Created PLACED relationships
* Graph traversals vs SQL JOINs

**Key concept:** Relationships are first-class citizens, not foreign keys. Direct traversals eliminate JOIN overhead.

**Building block 2:** Customer→Order path complete


[.slide]
== Module 4: Many-to-Many ⭐ THE CRITICAL MODULE

**What you learned:**
* Pivot tables → direct relationships
* Transform order_details (2,155 rows) into CONTAINS relationships
* Relationship properties (quantity, unitPrice)
* Multi-hop traversals (Customer→Order→Product)
* SQL 3 JOINs vs Cypher two-hop patterns

**Key concept:** Entire pivot table becomes relationships. Properties move from table columns to relationship properties.

**Building block 3:** Complete Customer→Order→Product path exists!


[.slide]
== Module 5: Similar Customers

**What you learned:**
* Bidirectional traversals
* Forward: Find my products
* Backward: Find customers who bought those products
* Similarity scoring (count shared products)
* Foundation of collaborative filtering

**Key concept:** Chain forward and backward traversals to find "people like me."

**Pattern emerged:** Similar customers are the bridge to recommendations.


[.slide]
== Module 6: The Money Query ⭐⭐ THE BIG REVEAL

**What you learned:**
* collect() for gathering lists
* WHERE NOT IN for filtering
* Complete recommendation query
* Advanced scoring (weighted similarity)
* **The comparison:** 11 lines Cypher vs 38 lines SQL, 80x faster

**Key concept:** Graph databases excel at connected data. O(k) pointer traversals vs O(n × m) table scans.

**Achievement unlocked:** Production-ready recommendation system!


[.slide]
== Module 7: Optional Enrichments (Optional)

**What you learned:**
* Categories as nodes (not properties)
* IN_CATEGORY relationships
* Category-based filtering and recommendations
* Category discovery
* Weighted recommendations by category affinity

**Key concept:** Enriching the graph with additional context enables more sophisticated queries.


[.slide]
== Module 8: Final Review (You Are Here)

**What you're learning:**
* Data quality with constraints and indexes
* Workshop review (this lesson)
* Knowledge check (next lesson)

**Key concept:** Constraints and indexes maintain quality and improve performance.


[.slide]
== Core Patterns You Mastered

**1. Basic Traversal**
```cypher
MATCH (a)-[r]->(b)
RETURN a, r, b;
```

**2. Multi-Hop Traversal**
```cypher
MATCH (a)-[:REL1]->(b)-[:REL2]->(c)
RETURN a, c;
```

**3. Bidirectional Pattern**
```cypher
MATCH (a)-[:REL1]->(b)<-[:REL2]-(c)
RETURN a, c;
```

**4. Negative Pattern**
```cypher
WHERE NOT (a)-[:REL]->(b)
```

**5. Aggregation**
```cypher
RETURN count(a), sum(r.property), collect(b.property)
```


[.slide]
== The Complete Recommendation Query

Here it is - what you built:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (me:Customer {customerId: 'ALFKI'})-[:PLACED]->(:Order)-[:CONTAINS]->(myProduct:Product)
MATCH (myProduct)<-[:CONTAINS]-(:Order)<-[:PLACED]-(other:Customer)
WHERE other <> me
MATCH (other)-[:PLACED]->(:Order)-[:CONTAINS]->(rec:Product)
WHERE NOT (me)-[:PLACED]->(:Order)-[:CONTAINS]->(rec)
  AND rec.unitsInStock > 0
RETURN rec.productName,
       rec.unitPrice,
       rec.unitsInStock,
       count(DISTINCT other) AS recommendedBy
ORDER BY recommendedBy DESC, rec.unitPrice
LIMIT 10;
----

**11 lines. Production-ready. 80x faster than SQL.**


[.slide]
== Key Principles You Applied

**1. Learn → Do → Practice**
* Theory (2-5 min)
* Hands-on challenge (7-12 min)
* Query validation (3-6 min)
* Optional practice (5-10 min)

**2. Progressive Building Blocks**
* Block 1: Products exist
* Block 2: Customer→Order path
* Block 3: Complete path
* Each block builds on the previous

**3. SQL Comparisons**
* Every module showed SQL equivalent
* Demonstrated graph advantages
* Proved performance benefits
