== Summary

In this knowledge check, you tested your understanding of:

* **Node identification** - When to use nodes vs properties
* **Relationships** - Connecting entities, handling many-to-many
* **Cypher patterns** - Multi-hop, bidirectional, negative patterns
* **Collaborative filtering** - Finding similar customers and recommending products
* **Performance** - Why graphs are faster (O(k) vs O(n × m))
* **Cypher functions** - collect(), count(), sum()
* **Constraints** - Maintaining data quality and improving performance

**Congratulations on completing the workshop!** 🎉
