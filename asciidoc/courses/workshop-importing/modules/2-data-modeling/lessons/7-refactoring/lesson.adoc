= Refactoring Your Graph Model

== Refactoring Your Graph Model


In the previous lesson, you learned how to test your data model with sample data. Testing often reveals opportunities to improve your model through refactoring.


In this lesson, you will learn about refactoring techniques and when to apply them.


[.slide]
== Understanding Refactoring


Refactoring means improving your graph data model while preserving its semantics (meaning). You might refactor to:


* Improve query performance
* Simplify the model
* Support new use cases
* Reduce data duplication
* Improve maintainability


[.slide]
== Refactoring in Neo4j


Unlike relational databases with rigid schemas, Neo4j makes refactoring easy:


* Schema is optional and flexible
* Cypher makes transformations straightforward
* No complex migrations required
* Can be done incrementally


[.slide]
== Common Refactoring Patterns


[.slide.discrete]
=== 1. Adding Labels for Specialization


Before: All employees have one label


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Employee<br/>Nancy<br/>Sales Rep]
    B[Employee<br/>Andrew<br/>Sales Manager]
```


After: Managers get an additional label


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Employee<br/>Nancy<br/>Sales Rep]
    B[Employee<br/>Manager<br/>Andrew<br/>Sales Manager]
```


Why: Faster queries for managers, better semantic meaning


[.slide.discrete]
=== 2. Property to Node


Before: Country is a property


```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Customer<br/>country: 'Germany'"]
    B["Customer<br/>country: 'France'"]
    C["Customer<br/>country: 'Germany'"]
```


After: Country is a node


```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Customer<br/>ALFKI] -->|LOCATED_IN| D[Country<br/>Germany]
    B[Customer<br/>BONAP] -->|LOCATED_IN| E[Country<br/>France]
    C[Customer<br/>FRANK] -->|LOCATED_IN| D
```


Why:


* Deduplicate data
* Add country properties (population, region)
* Query by country more efficiently
* Analyze geographic patterns


[.slide.discrete]
=== 3. Intermediate Node


Before: Direct relationship with properties


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Order] -->|"ORDERS<br/>quantity: 12<br/>unitPrice: 18.00"| B[Product]
```


After: Intermediate node for line items


```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Order] -->|CONTAINS| C[OrderDetail<br/>quantity: 12<br/>unitPrice: 18.00]
    C -->|FOR| B[Product]
```


Why:


* More flexible for complex scenarios
* Can add line-item-specific logic
* Clearer semantics


[.slide.discrete]
=== 4. Specific Relationship Types


Before: Generic relationship type


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Person] -->|RELATED_TO| B[Movie]
    C[Person] -->|RELATED_TO| B
    D[Person] -->|RELATED_TO| B
```


After: Specific relationship types


```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Person<br/>Tom Hanks] -->|ACTED_IN| B[Movie<br/>Forrest Gump]
    C[Person<br/>Robert Zemeckis] -->|DIRECTED| B
    D[Person<br/>Winston Groom] -->|WROTE| B
```


Why:


* More semantic meaning
* Faster specific queries
* Self-documenting model


[.slide.discrete]
=== 5. Extracting Shared Properties


Before: Duplicate properties on relationships


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Order] -->|"SHIPPED_BY<br/>shipperName: 'Federal'<br/>shipperPhone: '555-1234'"| B[Customer]
```


After: Shipper as separate node


```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Order] -->|SHIPPED_BY| C[Shipper<br/>Federal Shipping<br/>555-1234]
    C -->|SHIPS_TO| B[Customer]
```


Why:


* No data duplication
* Update shipper info in one place
* Query shippers independently


[.slide]
== Applying Refactoring to Northwind


The current Northwind model works well, but here are some potential refactorings:


[.slide.discrete]
=== Enhancement 1: Add Manager Label


```mermaid
graph TB
    E1[Employee<br/>Manager<br/>Andrew] -->|MANAGES| E2[Employee<br/>Nancy]
    E1 -->|MANAGES| E3[Employee<br/>Janet]
```


This makes finding all managers faster:


```cypher
MATCH (m:Manager)
RETURN m.firstName, m.lastName
```


[.slide.discrete]
=== Enhancement 2: Extract Shipper


Currently, shipping info is stored on Order properties:


* `shipName`
* `shipAddress`
* And more


You could extract a Shipper node:


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Order] -->|SHIPPED_BY| B[Shipper<br/>Federal Shipping]
    B -->|HAS_ADDRESS| C[Address<br/>123 Main St]
```


[.slide.discrete]
=== Enhancement 3: Time-based Segmentation


For very large datasets, segment by time:


```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Order 2023] -->|IN_YEAR| B[Year 2023]
    C[Order 2024] -->|IN_YEAR| D[Year 2024]
    E[Order 2025] -->|IN_YEAR| F[Year 2025]
```


This improves performance for time-range queries.


[.slide]
== When NOT to Refactor


Do not refactor just for the sake of it. Avoid refactoring when:


* The model is working well
* Performance is acceptable
* No new requirements
* The complexity does not justify the benefit


Remember: Premature optimization is wasteful. Start simple, refactor when needed.


[.slide]
== Following a Refactoring Process


1. Identify the problem or opportunity
2. Design the improved model
3. Test with sample data
4. Measure the improvement
5. Apply to production data
6. Verify the results


[.summary]
== Summary


In this lesson, you learned:


* What refactoring is and why it is valuable
* Neo4j makes refactoring easy compared to relational databases
* Common refactoring patterns:
  - Adding labels for specialization
  - Converting properties to nodes
  - Introducing intermediate nodes
  - Using specific relationship types
  - Extracting shared properties
* When to refactor and when not to
* The refactoring process


Your Northwind data model is now complete and ready for import.


In the next module, you will learn how to import the Northwind CSV data into your Neo4j Aura instance using the Data Importer tool.
