== Modeling Nodes and Labels


In the previous lesson, you learned about the Northwind domain and the use cases the data model must support.
To represent this domain in Neo4j, you need to identify the entities and categorize them.


In this lesson, you will learn how to model nodes and labels for the Northwind domain.


[.slide]
== Understanding Nodes


**Nodes** are the fundamental building blocks of a graph database.


A node represents an entity—something that exists independently and has its own data.


In the Northwind dataset, you model these as nodes because:


* **Customers** exist independently and have their own contact information
* **Orders** are distinct records with dates and shipping details
* **Products** have their own prices, stock levels, and descriptions
* **Categories** group products and have their own descriptions
* **Suppliers** are independent companies with contact information
* **Employees** have their own personal details and job titles


Each of these is a node because it has its own identity and properties, not just because it appears in the data.

== Understanding Labels


**Labels** categorize nodes into groups so you can work with them efficiently.


You use labels because:


* **Performance** - When you query for customers, Neo4j only scans Customer nodes instead of every node in the database. This makes queries significantly faster.
* **Clarity** - Labels make queries readable. `MATCH (c:Customer)` is self-documenting—you know exactly what type of data you're working with.
* **Constraints** - You can ensure every Customer has a unique customerId, but that constraint doesn't apply to Products or Orders. Labels let you enforce rules per entity type.
* **Indexing** - Indexes are created per label. You can index Customer by country without affecting how Products are stored.

== Choosing Labels for Northwind


For the Northwind domain, you will use these labels.


Each entity type gets its own label:


[options="header"]
|===
| Label | Represents
| `Customer` | A company that purchases products
| `Order` | A purchase order
| `Product` | An item for sale
| `Category` | A product category
| `Supplier` | A company that supplies products
| `Employee` | A staff member
|===

[.slide]
== Label Naming Conventions


When choosing label names:

* **Use nouns** - Labels represent things (Customer, Product, Order)
* **Use PascalCase** - Capitalize each word (CustomerOrder, not customer_order)
* **Be specific** - "Customer" is better than "Entity"
* **Singular form** - "Product" not "Products"


[.slide]
== Multiple Labels


A node can have multiple labels.


For example, an employee who is also a manager could have both `Employee` and `Manager` labels.


This is useful for:

* Representing hierarchies
* Adding additional categorization
* Query optimization


In Northwind, you might use multiple labels for:

* `Employee` + `Manager` for managers
* `Product` + `Discontinued` for discontinued products

[.slide]
== Distinguishing Data Models from Instance Models


It's important to distinguish between:


**Data Model** - The design or schema showing node labels and relationship types


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Customer] -->|PLACED| B[Order]
    B -->|CONTAINS| C[Product]
```


**Instance Model** - Actual data with specific nodes


```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Customer: ACME Corp"] -->|PLACED| B["Order: #10248"]
    B -->|CONTAINS| C["Product: Chai"]
```

[.slide]
== Northwind Data Model (Nodes Only)


Here is your initial data model with the node labels:


* Customer
* Order
* Product
* Category
* Supplier
* Employee


In the next lesson, you will connect these nodes with relationships.

== Summary


In this lesson, you learned about modeling nodes and labels in Neo4j:

* **Nodes** - Represent entities in your domain (Customer, Order, Product, Category, Supplier, Employee)
* **Labels** - Categorize nodes into types and enable query performance, schema definition, and indexing
* **Naming conventions** - Use nouns in PascalCase singular form
* **Multiple labels** - A node can have multiple labels for hierarchies and additional categorization
* **Data vs instance models** - Data models show the schema design while instance models show actual data


In the next lesson, you will learn how to model relationships to connect these nodes.
