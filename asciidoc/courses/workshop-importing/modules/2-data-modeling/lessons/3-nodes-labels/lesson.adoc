== Modeling Nodes and Labels


You learned about the Northwind domain and the use cases the data model must support.


In this lesson, you will learn how to model nodes and labels for the Northwind domain.


[.slide]
== What are Nodes?


**Nodes** are the fundamental building blocks of a graph database.


They represent entities or things in your domain.


In the Northwind dataset, nodes will represent:
* Customers
* Orders
* Products
* Categories
* Suppliers
* Employees


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Node] --> B[Represents an Entity]
    A --> C[Has Properties]
    A --> D[Has Labels]
    A --> E[Connected by Relationships]
```

[.slide]
== What are Labels?


**Labels** categorize nodes into groups.


A label is like a type or class for nodes.


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Customer Node] -->|has label| B[Customer]
    C[Product Node] -->|has label| D[Product]
    E[Order Node] -->|has label| F[Order]
```

=== Benefits of Labels


* **Query Performance** - Labels help Neo4j find nodes quickly
* **Schema Definition** - Labels define the structure of your graph
* **Semantic Meaning** - Labels make your model self-documenting
* **Indexing** - Indexes and constraints are based on labels

[.slide]
== Choosing Labels for Northwind


For the Northwind domain, you will use these labels:


```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Northwind Nodes] --> B[Customer]
    A --> C[Order]
    A --> D[Product]
    A --> E[Category]
    A --> F[Supplier]
    A --> G[Employee]
```


Each entity type gets its own label:


| Label | Represents |
|-------|------------|
| `Customer` | A company that purchases products |
| `Order` | A purchase order |
| `Product` | An item for sale |
| `Category` | A product category |
| `Supplier` | A company that supplies products |
| `Employee` | A staff member |

[.slide]
== Label Naming Conventions


When choosing label names:


* **Use nouns** - Labels represent things (Customer, Product, Order)
* **Use PascalCase** - Capitalize each word (CustomerOrder, not customer_order)
* **Be specific** - "Customer" is better than "Entity"
* **Singular form** - "Product" not "Products"


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Good Labels] --> B[Customer]
    A --> C[Product]
    A --> D[Order]

    E[Avoid] --> F[customer]
    E --> G[Products]
    E --> H[Thing]
```

[.slide]
== Multiple Labels


A node can have multiple labels.


For example, an employee who is also a manager:


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Node] -->|has labels| B[Employee]
    A -->|has labels| C[Manager]
```


This is useful for:
* Representing hierarchies
* Adding additional categorization
* Query optimization


In Northwind, you might use multiple labels for:
* `Employee` + `Manager` for managers
* `Product` + `Discontinued` for discontinued products

[.slide]
== Data Model vs Instance Model


It's important to distinguish between:


**Data Model** - The design or schema showing node labels and relationship types


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Customer] -->|PLACED| B[Order]
    B -->|CONTAINS| C[Product]
```


**Instance Model** - Actual data with specific nodes


```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Customer: ACME Corp"] -->|PLACED| B["Order: #10248"]
    B -->|CONTAINS| C["Product: Chai"]
```

[.slide]
== Northwind Data Model (Nodes Only)


Here's your initial data model showing just the node labels:


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Customer]
    B[Order]
    C[Product]
    D[Category]
    E[Supplier]
    F[Employee]
```


In the next lesson, you will connect these nodes with relationships.

== Summary


In this lesson, you learned:


* Nodes represent entities in your domain
* Labels categorize nodes into types
* Label naming conventions (nouns, PascalCase, singular)
* Nodes can have multiple labels
* The difference between data models and instance models
* The node labels for the Northwind model


In the next lesson, you will learn how to model relationships between nodes.
