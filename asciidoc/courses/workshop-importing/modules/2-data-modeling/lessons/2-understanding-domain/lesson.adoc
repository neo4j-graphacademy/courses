== Understanding the Northwind Domain


You learned about graph data modeling and the components of a Neo4j graph.


In this lesson, you will learn about the Northwind domain and define use cases for the workshop.


[.slide]
== The Northwind Database


The Northwind database is a sample dataset originally created by Microsoft to demonstrate database features.


It represents a fictitious food products company that imports and exports specialty foods worldwide.


```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Northwind Company] --> B[Employees]
    A --> C[Customers]
    A --> D[Suppliers]
    A --> E[Products]
    A --> F[Orders]

    B --> G[Process Orders]
    C --> H[Place Orders]
    D --> I[Supply Products]
    E --> J[Sold in Orders]
    F --> K[Contain Products]
```

[.slide]
== Domain Entities


The Northwind domain includes these key entities:


* **Customers** - Companies that purchase products
* **Orders** - Purchase orders placed by customers
* **Products** - Food items sold by the company
* **Categories** - Product categories (beverages, condiments, etc.)
* **Suppliers** - Companies that supply products
* **Employees** - Staff who process orders

== Use Cases for Northwind


Before modeling, you need to identify what questions the database needs to answer.


Here are the key use cases:


**Customer & Order Questions:**
1. What orders did a customer place?
2. What products were in an order?
3. Who was the employee responsible for an order?
4. What is the total value of an order?
5. Which customers have placed the most orders?


**Product & Supplier Questions:**
6. What products does a supplier provide?
7. What category does a product belong to?
8. Which products are most frequently ordered?
9. What is the stock level for each product?


**Employee Questions:**
10. Which employees report to which managers?
11. What orders has an employee processed?
12. Which employees have sold the most products?


```mermaid

    A --> C[Product Questions]
    A --> D[Employee Questions]

    B --> E[Orders by customer]
    B --> F[Customer purchase history]

    C --> G[Products by category]
    C --> H[Supplier relationships]

    D --> I[Reporting structure]
    D --> J[Employee performance]
```

[.slide]
== Understanding Relationships


What makes Northwind interesting are the **connections** between entities:


* Customers **PLACE** orders
* Orders **CONTAIN** products
* Products **BELONG TO** categories
* Suppliers **SUPPLY** products
* Employees **REPORT TO** managers
* Employees **PROCESS** orders


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Customer] -->|PLACED| B[Order]
    B -->|CONTAINS| C[Product]
    C -->|PART_OF| D[Category]
    C -->|SUPPLIED_BY| E[Supplier]
    F[Employee] -->|SOLD| B
    F -->|REPORTS_TO| G[Manager]
```


These relationships are what make a graph database ideal for Northwind.

[.slide]
== Why Graph for Northwind?


Traditional relational databases require complex JOINs to answer questions about connected data.


In a graph database:


* Relationships are first-class citizens
* No expensive JOINs needed
* Traversing relationships is fast and intuitive
* Adding new relationship types is easy


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Relational DB] -->|Multiple JOINs| B[Slow Queries]
    A -->|Complex SQL| C[Hard to Understand]

    D[Graph DB] -->|Direct Relationships| E[Fast Traversal]
    D -->|Cypher Patterns| F[Intuitive Queries]
```

== Summary


In this lesson, you learned:


* The Northwind domain represents a food products company
* Key entities: Customers, Orders, Products, Categories, Suppliers, Employees
* Important use cases the model must support
* Why relationships make Northwind ideal for a graph database


In the next lesson, you will learn how to model nodes and labels for the Northwind domain.
