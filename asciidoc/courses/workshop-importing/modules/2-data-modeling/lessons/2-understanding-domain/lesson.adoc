== Understanding the Northwind Domain


In the previous lesson, you learned about graph data modeling and the components of a Neo4j graph.


In this lesson, you will learn about the Northwind domain and the use cases the data model must support.


[.slide]
== The Northwind Database


The Northwind database is a sample dataset originally created by Microsoft to demonstrate database features.


It represents a fictitious food products company that imports and exports specialty foods worldwide.


[.slide]
== Domain Entities


The Northwind domain includes these key entities. Each becomes a node because it has independent existence and its own data:


* **Customers** - Companies that purchase products. They're entities because they exist independently, have their own contact information, and can place multiple orders.
* **Orders** - Purchase orders placed by customers. They're entities because each order is a distinct transaction with its own date, shipping details, and total value.
* **Products** - Food items sold by the company. They're entities because they have their own names, prices, stock levels, and can appear in multiple orders.
* **Categories** - Product categories (beverages, condiments, etc.). They're entities because they group multiple products and have their own descriptions.
* **Suppliers** - Companies that supply products. They're entities because they're independent organizations with their own contact information and can supply multiple products.
* **Employees** - Staff who process orders. They're entities because they have their own personal details, job titles, and can process multiple orders.


**Why not make "country" or "order date" entities?**

* Country is just a text attribute of a customer—it doesn't have its own data or relationships
* Order date is just a timestamp on an order—it's a property, not an independent thing


[.slide]
== Identify use cases


Before modeling, you need to identify what questions the database needs to answer.


Here are the key use cases:


**Customer and Order Questions:**

1. What orders did a customer place?
2. What products were in an order?
3. Who was the employee responsible for an order?
4. What is the total value of an order?
5. Which customers have placed the most orders?


**Product and Supplier Questions:**

6. What products does a supplier provide?
7. What category does a product belong to?
8. Which products are most frequently ordered?
9. What is the stock level for each product?


**Employee Questions:**

10. Which employees report to which managers?
11. What orders has an employee processed?
12. Which employees have sold the most products?


[.slide]
== Understand relationships


The **connections** between entities are what make the Northwind domain interesting:


* Customers **PLACE** orders
* Orders **CONTAIN** products
* Products **BELONG TO** categories
* Suppliers **SUPPLY** products
* Employees **REPORT TO** managers
* Employees **PROCESS** orders


```mermaid
graph LR
    A((Customer)) -->|PLACED| B((Order))
    B -->|CONTAINS| C((Product))
    C -->|PART_OF| D((Category))
    C -->|SUPPLIED_BY| E((Supplier))
    F((Employee)) -->|SOLD| B
    F -->|REPORTS_TO| G((Manager))
```


These relationships are what make a graph database ideal for Northwind.

[.slide]
== Why use a graph for Northwind?


Northwind is highly connected data. Consider this common question: "What products has this customer purchased?"


**In a relational database:**

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p.productName
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customerID = o.customerID
JOIN order_details od ON o.orderID = od.orderID
JOIN products p ON od.productID = p.productID
WHERE c.customerID = 'ALFKI';
----

* **Three JOINs required** - Each scans tables and matches keys
* **Performance degrades** - With more data, JOINs get exponentially slower
* **Not intuitive** - The query doesn't read like the question


**In a graph database:**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: 'ALFKI'})-[:PLACED]->(:Order)-[:ORDERS]->(p:Product)
RETURN DISTINCT p.productName;
----

* **No JOINs** - Direct traversal through relationships
* **Performance scales** - Traversing 10 relationships takes the same time as traversing 3
* **Reads naturally** - The query matches how you think about the problem


**Why this matters for Northwind:**

* Customers often order the same products repeatedly → Follow patterns over time
* Products belong to categories and suppliers → Navigate product hierarchies
* Employees report to managers → Understand organizational structure
* Orders connect customers, employees, and products → See the full transaction context


Graph databases excel when your queries involve navigating connections, which is exactly what business intelligence and data analysis require.

== Summary


In this lesson, you learned about the Northwind domain:


* **Northwind** - A sample dataset representing a food products company that imports and exports specialty foods
* **Domain entities** - Customers, Orders, Products, Categories, Suppliers, and Employees
* **Use cases** - Questions the database needs to answer about customers, orders, products, suppliers, and employees
* **Relationships** - Connections between entities (PLACED, CONTAINS, PART_OF, SUPPLIED_BY, SOLD, REPORTS_TO)
* **Graph advantages** - Relationships are first-class citizens, no expensive JOINs needed, and traversing relationships is fast


In the next lesson, you will learn how to model nodes and labels for the Northwind domain.
