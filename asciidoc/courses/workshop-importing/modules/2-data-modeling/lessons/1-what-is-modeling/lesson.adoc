= What is Graph Data Modeling?
:type: lesson
:order: 1

== Why Model?

Before importing data into Neo4j, you need to design a graph data model. This model defines how your data will be represented as nodes, relationships, and properties.

A good data model will:

* Answer your application's key use cases efficiently
* Provide optimal Cypher query performance
* Be intuitive and easy to understand
* Scale well as your data grows

== Components of a Neo4j Graph

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Graph Database] --> B[Nodes]
    A --> C[Relationships]
    A --> D[Properties]
    A --> E[Labels]
    
    B --> F[Represent entities]
    C --> G[Connect nodes]
    D --> H[Store attributes]
    E --> I[Categorize nodes]
```

The Neo4j components used to define a graph data model are:

* **Nodes** - Represent entities (things) in your domain
* **Labels** - Categorize and group nodes
* **Relationships** - Connect nodes and represent associations
* **Properties** - Store attributes on nodes and relationships

== Data Modeling Process

Here are the steps to create a graph data model:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Understand Domain] --> B[Define Use Cases]
    B --> C[Model Nodes]
    C --> D[Model Relationships]
    D --> E[Define Properties]
    E --> F[Test Model]
    F --> G{Does it work well?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Implement]
    G -->|No| I[Refactor Model]
    I --> F
```

1. **Understand the domain** - Learn about the business area and data
2. **Define use cases** - List the questions your application needs to answer
3. **Model nodes** - Identify the entities in your domain
4. **Model relationships** - Define how entities connect
5. **Define properties** - Specify what attributes to store
6. **Test the model** - Verify it answers your use cases efficiently
7. **Refactor if needed** - Improve the model based on testing

== Graph Data Modeling is Iterative

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Initial Model] -->|Test| B[Feedback]
    B -->|Refactor| C[Improved Model]
    C -->|Test| D[More Feedback]
    D -->|Refactor| E[Optimized Model]
```

Your initial graph data model is a starting point. As you:

* Learn more about use cases
* Test performance with real data
* Identify new requirements
* Scale your application

You will likely need to **refactor** your model. Refactoring means improving the model while preserving its semantics.

[NOTE]
====
Unlike relational databases with rigid schemas, Neo4j is schema-optional and flexible. You can easily modify the graph structure as your needs evolve.

== What Makes a Good Model?

A good graph data model:

* **Answers use cases** - Supports all required queries
* **Performs well** - Queries execute quickly
* **Is intuitive** - Easy to understand and explain
* **Is flexible** - Can adapt to new requirements
* **Scales** - Works with large amounts of data

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned:

* The purpose of graph data modeling
* The components of a Neo4j graph (nodes, relationships, properties, labels)
* The iterative data modeling process
* That refactoring is common and easy in Neo4j

In the next lesson, you will learn about the Northwind domain and define use cases for the workshop.
