== What is Graph Data Modeling?


Now that you have a Neo4j Aura instance set up, you are ready to start working with data.


Before you can import data into Neo4j, you need to design a graph data model.


In this lesson, you will learn about graph data modeling and the components of a Neo4j graph.


[.slide]
== Why Model?


A graph data model defines how your data will be represented as nodes, relationships, and properties.


A good data model will:


* Answer your application's key use cases efficiently
* Provide optimal Cypher query performance
* Be intuitive and easy to understand
* Scale well as your data grows

== Components of a Neo4j Graph


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Graph Database] --> B[Nodes]
    A --> C[Relationships]
    A --> D[Properties]
    A --> E[Labels]

    B --> F[Represent entities]
    C --> G[Connect nodes]
    D --> H[Store attributes]
    E --> I[Categorize nodes]
```


The Neo4j components used to define a graph data model are:


* **Nodes** - Represent entities (things) in your domain
* **Labels** - Categorize and group nodes
* **Relationships** - Connect nodes and represent associations
* **Properties** - Store attributes on nodes and relationships

[.slide]
== Data Modeling Process


Here are the steps you will follow to create a graph data model:


```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Understand Domain] --> B[Define Use Cases]
    B --> C[Model Nodes]
    C --> D[Model Relationships]
    D --> E[Define Properties]
    E --> F[Test Model]
    F --> G{Does it work well?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Implement]
    G -->|No| I[Refactor Model]
    I --> F
```


1. **Understand the domain** - Learn about the business area and data
2. **Define use cases** - List the questions your application needs to answer
3. **Model nodes** - Identify the entities in your domain
4. **Model relationships** - Define how entities connect
5. **Define properties** - Specify what attributes to store
6. **Test the model** - Verify it answers your use cases efficiently
7. **Refactor if needed** - Improve the model based on testing

[.slide]
== Graph Data Modeling is Iterative


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Initial Model] -->|Test| B[Feedback]
    B -->|Refactor| C[Improved Model]
    C -->|Test| D[More Feedback]
    D -->|Refactor| E[Optimized Model]
```


Your initial graph data model is a starting point.


As you learn more about use cases, test performance with real data, identify new requirements, and scale your application, you will likely need to refactor your model.


Refactoring means improving the model while preserving its semantics.


[NOTE]
====
Unlike relational databases with rigid schemas, Neo4j is schema-optional and flexible. You can easily modify the graph structure as your needs evolve.

== What Makes a Good Model?


A good graph data model:


* **Answers use cases** - Supports all required queries
* **Performs well** - Queries execute quickly
* **Is intuitive** - Easy to understand and explain
* **Is flexible** - Can adapt to new requirements
* **Scales** - Works with large amounts of data


[.summary]
== Summary


In this lesson, you learned:


* The purpose of graph data modeling
* The components of a Neo4j graph (nodes, relationships, properties, labels)
* The iterative data modeling process
* That refactoring is common and easy in Neo4j


In the next lesson, you will learn about the Northwind domain and define use cases for the workshop.
