== What is graph data modeling?


In the previous module, you set up your Neo4j Aura instance and explored its tools. Before you can import data into Neo4j, you need to design a graph data model.


In this lesson, you will learn about graph data modeling and the components of a Neo4j graph.


[.slide]
== Why model your data?


You need to design a graph data model before importing because **how you structure your data determines what questions you can answer and how efficiently**.


**Without a model:**

* You might store everything as properties on one node type
* Queries become slow because there are no relationships to traverse
* Finding patterns requires scanning all data
* The structure doesn't reflect how the business thinks about the data


**With a thoughtful model:**

* **Answers use cases efficiently** - If you often ask "What did this customer order?", model a direct PLACED relationship from Customer to Order
* **Query performance** - Following a relationship is instant; scanning millions of properties is slow
* **Intuitive structure** - Your model should match how people think about the domain. If someone says "customers place orders," you should see `(Customer)-[:PLACED]->(Order)` in your model
* **Scalability** - Graph queries scale based on the connected data you touch, not the total data in the database. Good models let you touch only what you need.


**Example:**

If you store product categories as a property (`product.category = 'Beverages'`), you must scan all products to find beverages. If you model Category as a node with a PART_OF relationship, you traverse directly from the category node to its products—instant access regardless of how many total products exist.

== Components of a Neo4j graph


Neo4j uses four components to model your domain. Understanding when to use each one is key to effective graph modeling:


* **Nodes** - Use these for entities that exist independently (Customer, Product, Order). Ask: "Does this thing have its own data and identity?"
* **Labels** - Use these to categorize nodes by type (Customer, Product). Ask: "What type of thing is this?"
* **Relationships** - Use these for connections between entities (PLACED, ORDERS). Ask: "How do these things relate?"
* **Properties** - Use these for attributes that describe nodes or relationships (name, price, quantity). Ask: "What information describes this thing or connection?"


The key is choosing the right component based on how you'll query the data, not just based on how it appears in your source files.

== Data modeling process


Here are the steps you will follow to create a graph data model:


1. **Understand the domain** - Learn about the business area and data
2. **Define use cases** - List the questions your application needs to answer
3. **Model nodes** - Identify the entities in your domain
4. **Model relationships** - Define how entities connect
5. **Define properties** - Specify what attributes to store
6. **Test the model** - Verify it answers your use cases efficiently
7. **Refactor if needed** - Improve the model based on testing

[.slide]
== Graph data modeling is iterative


Your initial graph data model is a starting point.


As you learn more about use cases, test performance with real data, identify new requirements, and scale your application, you will likely need to refactor your model.


Refactoring means improving the model while preserving its semantics.


[NOTE]
.Schema flexibility
====
Unlike relational databases with rigid schemas, Neo4j is schema-optional and flexible. You can easily modify the graph structure as your needs evolve.

== What makes a good model?


A good graph data model:


* **Answers use cases** - Supports all required queries
* **Performs well** - Queries execute quickly
* **Is intuitive** - Easy to understand and explain
* **Is flexible** - Can adapt to new requirements
* **Scales** - Works with large amounts of data


[.summary]
== Summary


In this lesson, you learned about graph data modeling fundamentals:


* **Data model** - Defines how data is represented as nodes, relationships, and properties to answer application use cases efficiently
* **Components** - Nodes (entities), labels (categories), relationships (connections), and properties (attributes)
* **Modeling process** - Iterative approach: understand domain, define use cases, model nodes and relationships, define properties, test, and refactor
* **Schema flexibility** - Neo4j is schema-optional, making it easy to modify the graph structure as needs evolve


In the next lesson, you will learn about the Northwind domain and define use cases for the workshop.
