= Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals
:order: 2

In this module, you will learn the fundamentals of graph data modeling and apply these concepts to design a model for the Northwind dataset.

Graph data modeling is the process of designing how your data will be represented as nodes, relationships, and properties in Neo4j.

In this module, you will:

* Understand what graph data modeling is and why it matters
* Learn about the Northwind domain and its use cases
* Model nodes and labels for entities
* Model relationships between entities
* Define properties for nodes and relationships
* Test your data model against use cases
* Learn when and how to refactor your model

If you are ready, let's get going!
