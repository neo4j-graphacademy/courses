== Introduction

In this workshop, you will transform a real-world relational dataset into a graph database and discover the benefits of using graph databases for connected data.


[.slide.col-2]
== Working with Connected Data

[.col]
====
You will import data from the **Northwind dataset**.  The dataset represents a fictitious food products company, with data about customers, orders, products, suppliers, and employees.

* 91 customers
* 830 orders
* 77 products across 8 categories
* 29 suppliers
* 9 employees

== Common business questions

Common business questions include:

* Which products has this customer purchased across all their orders?
* What's the purchasing pattern for customers in a specific region?
* Which suppliers provide products in the most orders?
* How do employee reporting structures relate to sales performance?

These questions are about **relationships and connections**, not just individual records.


[.slide.col-2]
== The Relational Database Problem

In a traditional relational database, answering these questions requires multiple JOINs across many tables.


[.col]
====
**Example: "What products has customer ALFKI purchased?"**

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p.productName
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customerID = o.customerID
JOIN order_details od ON o.orderID = od.orderID
JOIN products p ON od.productID = p.productID
WHERE c.customerID = 'ALFKI';
----
====

[.col]
====
**The problems:**

* Three JOIN operations scan and match thousands of rows
* Performance degrades as data grows
* Complex queries become difficult to write and maintain
* The query structure doesn't match how you think about the problem
====

[.slide]
== What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you will have built a **working graph database** that represents Northwind data as nodes and relationships.

The graph database will allow you to answer complex business questions that are either not possible, or difficult, to answer with a traditional relational database.


[.slide]
=== Module 1: Setup

* Set up your Neo4j database environment
* Understand the tools available for importing and querying

[.slide]
=== Module 2: Data Modeling

* Learn why graph modeling is different from relational modeling
* Design a graph model for Northwind step-by-step
* Understand when to use nodes, relationships, and properties

[.slide]
=== Module 3: Importing Data

* Map CSV files to your graph model
* Import nodes and create relationships between them
* Set up constraints and indexes for data integrity

[.slide]
=== Module 4: Querying Your Graph

* Write Cypher queries to explore your data
* Answer complex business questions with simple queries
* Compare graph queries to their relational equivalents


[.slide]
== Why Graph Databases?

Graph databases store relationships as first-class citizens, not as foreign keys in tables.


**The same query in a graph database:**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: 'ALFKI'})-[:PLACED]->(:Order)-[:ORDERS]->(p:Product)
RETURN DISTINCT p.productName;
----

**The advantages:**

* No JOINs—you traverse relationships directly
* Performance stays constant even with millions of relationships
* Queries read like the questions you're asking
* Easy to explore connections and patterns


[.slide]
== Creating your environment

To build your graph database, you need a Neo4j instance. You'll use **Neo4j Aura**, a fully managed cloud database service.


**Why Aura for this workshop:**

* Free tier available—no credit card required
* Set up in minutes—no installation needed
* Includes built-in tools for importing and querying
* Accessible from anywhere via web browser


In the next lesson, you will learn about Neo4j Aura.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the workshop goals and approach:

* **The challenge** - Relational databases struggle with connected data questions requiring multiple JOINs
* **What you'll build** - A graph database representing Northwind business data with nodes and relationships
* **What you'll learn** - Graph data modeling, importing CSV data, and querying with Cypher
* **Your outcomes** - Hands-on experience transforming relational data into a graph, querying connected data efficiently, and comparing graph vs relational approaches
* **The approach** - Work with real Northwind data (91 customers, 830 orders, 77 products) to build a production-ready graph


In the next lesson, you will set up your Neo4j Aura instance to begin building your graph database.
