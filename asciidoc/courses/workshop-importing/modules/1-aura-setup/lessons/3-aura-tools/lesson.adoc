== Exploring Aura Tools

Now that your instance is running, let's explore the tools available in the Aura console for working with your database.

Neo4j Aura provides several built-in tools that you'll use throughout this workshop.

== Key Tools in Aura

```mermaid

    A[Aura Console] --> B[Data Importer]
    A --> C[Query Tool]
    A --> D[Explore]
    A --> E[Instance Management]
    
    B --> F[Import CSV files]
    C --> G[Write Cypher queries]
    D --> H[Visualize graph data]
    E --> I[Backups, settings, etc]
```

== 1. Data Importer

The **Data Importer** is a visual tool for importing CSV data into Neo4j.

**What you can do:**
* Upload CSV files
* Design your graph data model visually
* Map CSV columns to nodes and relationships
* Set up constraints and indexes
* Run the import with one click

```mermaid

    A[Upload CSV] --> B[Design Model]
    B --> C[Map Properties]
    C --> D[Set Constraints]
    D --> E[Run Import]
```

You'll use this extensively in Module 3 to import the Northwind dataset.

== 2. Query Tool

The **Query** tool (also called Neo4j Browser or Query Console) lets you:

* Write and execute Cypher queries
* Visualize query results as graphs or tables
* Explore your data interactively
* Save and share queries

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Write Cypher] --> B[Execute Query]
    B --> C{View Results}
    C -->|Graph| D[Visual Network]
    C -->|Table| E[Tabular Data]
```

You'll use this in Module 4 to query your imported Northwind data.

== 3. Explore Tool

The **Explore** tool provides:

* Interactive graph visualization
* Point-and-click navigation
* Node and relationship inspection
* Quick insights into your data

This is great for exploring your data without writing queries.

== 4. Instance Management

From the instance details page, you can:

* View connection information
* Create snapshots (backups)
* Monitor database metrics
* Manage users and security
* Configure instance settings

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Instance Management] --> B[Connection Info]
    A --> C[Snapshots]
    A --> D[Metrics]
    A --> E[Security]
    A --> F[Settings]
```

== Accessing the Tools

To access these tools from the Aura console:

1. Click on your instance
2. Click **Open** or click the arrow icon
3. Choose the tool you want to use

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Aura Console] --> B[Click Instance]
    B --> C[Click Open]
    C --> D{Choose Tool}
    D --> E[Data Importer]
    D --> F[Query]
    D --> G[Explore]
```

== What's Next?

Now that you have:
* ✓ Created your Aura instance
* ✓ Saved your credentials
* ✓ Learned about the available tools

You're ready to start learning about graph data modeling!

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the key tools available in Neo4j Aura:

* **Data Importer** - For importing CSV data
* **Query Tool** - For writing Cypher queries
* **Explore** - For visual data exploration
* **Instance Management** - For database administration

In the next module, you will learn the fundamentals of graph data modeling before importing the Northwind dataset.
