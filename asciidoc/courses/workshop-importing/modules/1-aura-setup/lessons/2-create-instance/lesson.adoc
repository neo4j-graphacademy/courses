== Creating an Aura Free Instance

In this lesson, you will create your first Neo4j Aura Free database instance.

By the end of this lesson, you will have a running Neo4j database in the cloud, ready to import the Northwind dataset.

== Step 1: Sign Up for Aura

Go to link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/[neo4j.com/cloud/aura^] and click **Start Free**.

You can sign up using:
* Email address
* Google account
* GitHub account

    C -->|Google| D
    C -->|GitHub| D
    D --> E[Verify Email if needed]
    E --> F[Access Aura Console]
```

== Step 2: Create a New Instance

Once logged in to the Aura Console:

1. Click **New Instance** or **Create Instance**
2. Select **AuraDB Free**
3. The instance will be created automatically with default settings

    C -->|Auto-create| D[Instance Created]
```

[NOTE]
====
Free instances are created in a default region close to your location. For paid tiers, you can select the specific region.
====

== Step 3: Save Your Credentials

**IMPORTANT:** When your instance is created, you will see a dialog with your connection details:

* **Username**: `neo4j` (default)
* **Password**: A randomly generated password
* **Connection URI**: `neo4j+s://<instance-id>.databases.neo4j.io`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Instance Created] --> B[Credentials Dialog Appears]
    B --> C[Download Credentials File]
    B --> D[Copy Password]
    C --> E[Store Safely]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Close Dialog]
```

**Download the credentials file** or copy the password immediately. You cannot retrieve the auto-generated password later!

[WARNING]
====
**Save your credentials now!** If you lose them, you'll need to reset your password or create a new instance.
====

== Instance Details

Your connection details will look like this:

[source]
----
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-generated-password
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
----

== Step 4: Wait for Instance to Start

After saving credentials, your instance will show:

* **Status**: Creating → Running
* **Size**: Free (fixed size)
* **Region**: Auto-assigned

```mermaid

    Creating --> Running

    note right of Creating
        Takes 1-2 minutes
    end note
    
    note right of Running
        Ready to use!
    end note
```

The instance typically takes 1-2 minutes to start. When the status shows **Running**, your database is ready!

== Verifying Your Instance

Once running, you'll see your instance in the console with:

* Instance name (e.g., "Instance01")
* Status indicator (green dot for running)
* Connection URI
* Options to Open, Manage, or Delete

```

== Summary

In this lesson, you:

* Signed up for Neo4j Aura
* Created a free database instance
* Saved your connection credentials
* Verified your instance is running

In the next lesson, you will explore the tools available in the Aura console for importing and querying data.
