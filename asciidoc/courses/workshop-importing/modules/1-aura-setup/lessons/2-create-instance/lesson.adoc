== Creating an Aura Free Instance

You have learned what Neo4j Aura is and why it's the ideal platform for your graph database needs.
Now, you will create your first Aura instance to host your Northwind data.


In this lesson, you will create a Neo4j Aura Free database instance and save your connection credentials.


You will have a running Neo4j database in the cloud, ready to import the Northwind dataset.

[NOTE]
====
Free instances are created in a default region close to your location. For paid tiers, you can select the specific region.

== Step 3: Save Your Credentials


**IMPORTANT:** When your instance is created, you will see a dialog with your connection details:


* **Username**: `neo4j` (default)
* **Password**: A randomly generated password
* **Connection URI**: `neo4j+s://<instance-id>.databases.neo4j.io`

    B --> C[Download Credentials File]
    B --> D[Copy Password]
    C --> E[Store Safely]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Close Dialog]
```


**Download the credentials file** or copy the password immediately. You cannot retrieve the auto-generated password later!


[WARNING]
====
**Save your credentials now!** If you lose them, you'll need to reset your password or create a new instance.

== Instance Details


Your connection details will look like this:


[source]
----
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-generated-password
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
----

== Step 4: Wait for Instance to Start


After saving credentials, your instance will show:


* **Status**: Creating → Running
* **Size**: Free (fixed size)
* **Region**: Auto-assigned


```mermaid

        Takes 1-2 minutes
    end note
    
    note right of Running
        Ready to use!
    end note
```


The instance typically takes 1-2 minutes to start. When the status shows **Running**, your database is ready!

== Verifying Your Instance


Once running, you will see your instance in the console with:


* Instance name (e.g., "Instance01")
* Status indicator (green dot for running)
* Connection URI
* Options to Open, Manage, or Delete
