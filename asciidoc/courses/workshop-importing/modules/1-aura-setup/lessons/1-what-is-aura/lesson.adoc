== Understanding Neo4j Aura

Welcome to the Importing Data Workshop!


In this workshop, you will import the Northwind dataset into Neo4j. The Northwind dataset represents a fictitious food products company with customers, orders, products, suppliers, and employees.


To get started, you need a Neo4j database. The easiest way is to use Neo4j Aura, a fully managed cloud database service.


In this lesson, you will learn what Neo4j Aura is and why it's ideal for this workshop.
