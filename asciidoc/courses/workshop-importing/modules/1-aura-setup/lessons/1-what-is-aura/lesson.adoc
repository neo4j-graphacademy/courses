= Workshop Overview: Building Your First Graph Database

== Introduction

Welcome to the Importing Data Workshop!

In this workshop, you will transform a real-world relational dataset into a graph database and discover how graph databases excel at answering questions about connected data.


[.slide]
== The Challenge: Working with Connected Data

You have a dataset from Northwind, a fictitious food products company. The data includes customers, orders, products, suppliers, and employees—all interconnected.


**Common business questions include:**

* Which products has this customer purchased across all their orders?
* What's the purchasing pattern for customers in a specific region?
* Which suppliers provide products in the most orders?
* How do employee reporting structures relate to sales performance?


These questions are about **relationships and connections**, not just individual records.


[.slide]
== The Relational Database Problem

In a traditional relational database, answering these questions requires multiple JOINs across many tables.


**Example: "What products has customer ALFKI purchased?"**

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p.productName
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customerID = o.customerID
JOIN order_details od ON o.orderID = od.orderID
JOIN products p ON od.productID = p.productID
WHERE c.customerID = 'ALFKI';
----

**The problems:**

* Three JOIN operations scan and match thousands of rows
* Performance degrades as data grows
* Complex queries become difficult to write and maintain
* The query structure doesn't match how you think about the problem


[.slide]
== What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you will have built a **working graph database** that represents Northwind data as nodes and relationships.


**Your graph will include:**

* Customer, Order, Product, Category, Supplier, and Employee nodes
* Direct relationships connecting these entities (PLACED, ORDERS, PART_OF, SUPPLIED_BY, SOLD, REPORTS_TO)
* Properties on nodes and relationships storing business data


[.slide]
== What You'll Learn

This workshop teaches you the complete process of building a graph database:


**Module 1: Setup**

* Set up your Neo4j database environment
* Understand the tools available for importing and querying


**Module 2: Data Modeling**

* Learn why graph modeling is different from relational modeling
* Design a graph model for Northwind step-by-step
* Understand when to use nodes, relationships, and properties


**Module 3: Importing Data**

* Map CSV files to your graph model
* Import nodes and create relationships between them
* Set up constraints and indexes for data integrity


**Module 4: Querying Your Graph**

* Write Cypher queries to explore your data
* Answer complex business questions with simple queries
* Compare graph queries to their relational equivalents


[.slide]
== Why Graph Databases?

Graph databases store relationships as first-class citizens, not as foreign keys in tables.


**The same query in a graph database:**

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: 'ALFKI'})-[:PLACED]->(:Order)-[:ORDERS]->(p:Product)
RETURN DISTINCT p.productName;
----

**The advantages:**

* No JOINs—you traverse relationships directly
* Performance stays constant even with millions of relationships
* Queries read like the questions you're asking
* Easy to explore connections and patterns


[.slide]
== Your Outcomes

By completing this workshop, you will:


* **Understand graph data modeling** - Know how to design nodes, relationships, and properties
* **Import real-world data** - Transform CSV files into a graph database
* **Query connected data** - Write Cypher queries to answer complex business questions
* **Compare approaches** - See why graphs excel at connected data compared to relational databases


You'll have hands-on experience with the complete workflow from raw data to actionable insights.


[.slide]
== The Workshop Approach

You'll work with real Northwind CSV files containing:


* 91 customers
* 830 orders
* 77 products across 8 categories
* 29 suppliers
* 9 employees


You'll transform this relational data into a graph, creating approximately 4,000 nodes and relationships that represent the business domain naturally.


[.slide]
== Getting Started

To build your graph database, you need a Neo4j instance. You'll use **Neo4j Aura**, a fully managed cloud database service.


**Why Aura for this workshop:**

* Free tier available—no credit card required
* Set up in minutes—no installation needed
* Includes built-in tools for importing and querying
* Accessible from anywhere via web browser


In the next lesson, you will create your free Neo4j Aura instance.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the workshop goals and approach:


* **The challenge** - Relational databases struggle with connected data questions requiring multiple JOINs
* **What you'll build** - A graph database representing Northwind business data with nodes and relationships
* **What you'll learn** - Graph data modeling, importing CSV data, and querying with Cypher
* **Your outcomes** - Hands-on experience transforming relational data into a graph and querying connected data efficiently
* **The approach** - Work with real Northwind data (91 customers, 830 orders, 77 products) to build a production-ready graph


In the next lesson, you will set up your Neo4j Aura instance to begin building your graph database.
