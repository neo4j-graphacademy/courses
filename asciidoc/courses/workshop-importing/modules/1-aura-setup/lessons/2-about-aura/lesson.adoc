== Introduction

To build your graph, you need a Neo4j database. This lesson introduces Neo4j Aura, the fully managed cloud database service you'll use for the workshop.


In this lesson, you will learn what Neo4j Aura is, the different tiers available, and why the Free tier is perfect for this workshop.


[.slide]
== What is Neo4j Aura?

Neo4j Aura is a fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) for Neo4j graph databases.


**Fully managed means:**

* **No infrastructure to manage** - Neo4j handles servers, maintenance, and operations
* **Built-in reliability** - 99.95% uptime SLA with fault tolerance
* **Automatic backups** - Your data is protected with regular automated backups
* **Always up to date** - Software updates and security patches are applied automatically
* **Enterprise security** - Encryption at rest and in transit, plus network isolation


You focus on building your graph and querying data. Aura handles everything else.

== Aura vs. Self-Managed Neo4j

The key difference between Aura and self-managed Neo4j is who handles operational responsibilities.

[.col]
====
**With self-managed Neo4j:**

* You install and configure servers
* You manage backups and disaster recovery
* You apply updates and security patches
* You monitor performance and scale infrastructure
* You handle high availability setup

====

[.col]
====
**With Aura:**

* Neo4j manages all infrastructure
* Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
* Updates applied with zero downtime
* Built-in monitoring and alerting
* High availability included (on higher tiers)

====


For this workshop, Aura lets you focus on learning graph modeling and Cypher queries without managing database infrastructure.
