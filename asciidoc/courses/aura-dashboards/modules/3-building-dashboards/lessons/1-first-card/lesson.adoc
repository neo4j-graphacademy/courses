= Organize your dashboard structure
:type: lesson
:order: 1

In the previous lesson, you learned how to create dashboards using AI and natural language prompts.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Create cards using Cypher queries for more control over data visualization
* Connect to your instance using the Query tool
* Create dashboard pages and organize layouts
* Customize card styling and results

== Connecting

Before you start, make sure you have completed the previous lesson and loaded the movie recommendations dataset into your instance.

NOTE: The movie recommendations data should be _loaded_ into your instance using the provided Cypher script, not the Import service.

If you haven't done that yet, go back to lesson 3 - Exploring Dashboards and follow the steps to load the movie data.

Open the console and select the instance you want to connect to. Make a note of the number of nodes and relationships in the database, as you might need to create filters to work with larger datasets.

Connect to the instance directly from the console by adding the credentials in the connection dialog:

Before you select **Query**, check that you've loaded the data from the previous lesson.

== Querying

Start by exploring the database details.
Copy the following query into the Cypher editor:
Click on the labels and relationship types under **Database Information** to see the number of nodes and relationships in the database.

Copy the following Cypher query into the query editor:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p,r,m
----

Use the **Run** button or press `Ctrl+Enter` to execute the query.

To change the styling of the results, click on the labels in the **Results overview** and adjust colors, sizes, and captions according to your preferences.

== Creating a new dashboard page

For this lesson, you will create a new dashboard page to add your first card. 

image::images/create-dashboard.png[Create dashboard,width=600,align=center]

If you have not created any dashboards yet, you need to select **Create from scratch** to start building your first dashboard page:

If you have already exceeded the dashboards limit for your tier, creating a new dashboard page will prompt you to upgrade your tier. 

Either delete an existing dashboard or keep working on an existing dashboard.

To create a new dashboard page, go to the **Dashboards** menu and click on the **New page** button:

Give your dashboard a meaningful name, such as "Stakeholders view", or "Practice dashboard", and click **Create**.

Edit your dashboard's name later by clicking on the title in the dashboard editor: 

image::images/edit-page-name.png[Edit dashboard name dialog,width=600,align=center]

The name editor allows you to change the dashboard name at any time. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the dashboard for easier identification later on:

== Creating your first recommendation dashboard card

In this section, create your first dashboard card using the Query tool. This card will visualize movie data from your recommendation dataset.

From your newly created dashboard, click on the **Create from Scratch** and **Add a card** button to open the card editor:

Use the card editor to describe the card properties:

image::images/create-natural-leanguage-card.png[Create card dialog,width=600,align=center]

Create a card that shows which movies Tom Hanks has acted in. This visualization helps stakeholders understand actor-movie relationships in your recommendation system, using the following Cypher query. 

Copy and paste the query into the Query field:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p,r,m
----

== Summary
In this lesson you learned how to use the Query tool to connect to your movie recommendation dataset, execute Cypher queries, and visualize the results. You created your first dashboard card that visualizes actor-movie relationships.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to visualize aggregated metrics from your movie recommendation data, such as ratings distributions, genre popularity, and actor collaboration patterns.
