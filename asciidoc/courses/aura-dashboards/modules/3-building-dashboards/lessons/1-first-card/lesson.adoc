= Organize your dashboard structure
:type: lesson
:order: 1

So far in this course, you have learned how to create dashboards using AI and natural language prompts.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Create dashboard pages and organize layouts
* Customize card styling and results
* Use Cypher queries for more control over data visualization

Before you start, make sure you have completed the previous lesson and have a dashboard with at least one card created.

== Creating a new dashboard page

If you have not created any dashboards yet, you need to select **Create from scratch** to start building your first dashboard page.

[NOTE]
.Dashboard limit
====
If you have exceeded the dashboards limit for your tier, creating a new dashboard page will prompt you to upgrade your tier.
====

Either delete an existing dashboard or keep working on an existing dashboard.

To create a new dashboard page, go to the **Dashboards** menu and click on the **New page** button:

Give your dashboard a meaningful name, such as "Stakeholders view", or "Practice dashboard", and click **Create**.

Edit your dashboard's name later by clicking on the title in the dashboard editor.

The name editor allows you to change the dashboard name at any time. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the dashboard for easier identification later on:

== Customizing card styling

Once you have cards in your dashboard, customize their appearance to improve readability and visual appeal.

To change the styling of query results, click on the labels in the **Results overview** and adjust colors, sizes, and captions according to your preferences.

== Using Cypher queries for card creation

In the previous module, you learned how to create cards using AI. For more control over data visualization, create cards using Cypher queries directly.

From your dashboard, click **Add a card** to open the card editor.

Use the card editor to define the card properties and paste your Cypher query into the Query field.

For example, create a card that shows which movies Tom Hanks has acted in:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p,r,m
----

== Summary
In this lesson you learned how to create dashboard pages, organize layouts, and customize card styling. You also learned how to create cards using Cypher queries for more precise control over data visualization.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to visualize aggregated metrics from your movie recommendation data, such as ratings distributions, genre popularity, and actor collaboration patterns.
