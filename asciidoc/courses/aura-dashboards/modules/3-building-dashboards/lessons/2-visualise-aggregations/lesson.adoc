:type: lesson
:order: 3

So far in this course, you have learned how to organize your dashboard structure.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Compare different ways to visualize aggregated metrics
* Visualize your aggregated data using Cypher queries
* Choose the appropriate visualization type for your data


== Visualizing the data

There are multiple visualization types available in Neo4j Dashboards, each suited for different data representation needs.

From the card editor, select the dropdown menu under **Visualization type** to choose the most appropriate visualization for your data:


image::images/change-card-type.png[Change card type dialog,width=600,align=center]

The Dashboard tool supports the following visualization types:

* Graph - Shows relationships between nodes.
* Table - Displays detailed data in a structured format.
* Line Chart - Tracks trends over time.
* Bar Chart - Compares quantities across categories.
* Pie Chart - Displays proportions of a whole.
* Single Value - Highlights a key metric.
* Text - Adds descriptive information or context.


=== Graph card

The **Graph** visualization type is ideal for displaying relationships between nodes in your graph database. It provides an interactive way to explore how different entities are connected.

Use the AI assistant to generate a graph card based on a natural language prompt, or write a Cypher query to fetch specific nodes and relationships.

For example, create a graph card to visualize the relationships between actors and movies:

image::images/ai-generated-graph.png[Graph card example,width=600,align=center]

=== Table card

The **Table** visualization type displays data in a structured format, making it easy to read and analyze.

Create a table card to show a list of movies along with their genres and release years:

Execute the following Cypher query in the card editor to get the results:
[source,cypher ]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN m.title AS movie, u.name AS user, r.rating AS rating
ORDER BY r.rating DESC
LIMIT 10
----

=== Line chart card

The **Line Chart** visualization type is useful for showing trends over time. It allows you to visualize data points connected by lines, making it easy to identify patterns and fluctuations.

Create a line chart card to visualize the average ratings of movies over time:

Execute the following Cypher query in the card editor to get the results:
[source,cypher ]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WITH m, toInteger(m.year / 10) * 10 AS decade
RETURN decade, count(m) AS movieCount
ORDER BY decade
----

After running this query, select **Line Chart** from the visualization type dropdown to display the results.

You should obtain something similar to this:

image::images/movies-by-decade.png[Line Chart card example,width=600,align=center]

=== Bar Chart card

The **Bar Chart** visualization type is suitable for comparing quantities across categories. It provides a clear visual representation of data, making it easy to identify trends and patterns.

Create a bar chart card to visualize the ratings distribution per location:

Execute the following Cypher query in the card editor to get the results:
[source,cypher ]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.bornIn AS country, count(m) AS movieCount
ORDER BY movieCount DESC
----

image::images/bar-chart-ratings-per-location.png[Bar Chart card example,width=600,align=center]

Challenge: Create a bar chart card to visualize the number of movies directed by each person.

=== Pie Chart card

The **Pie Chart** visualization type is great for displaying proportions of a whole. It allows you to visualize how different categories contribute to the total.

Create a pie chart card to visualize the distribution of directors average movie ratings:

Ask the GenAI assistant to create a pie chart card using the following prompt: "Create a pie chart showing directors with the highest average movie ratings." or run the following Cypher query in the card editor to get the results:

[source,cypher ]
----
/* Which directors have the highest average movie ratings? */

MATCH (d:Director)-[r:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)<-[r2:RATED]-(u:User)
WITH d, avg(r2.rating) AS averageRating
ORDER BY averageRating DESC
RETURN d.name AS directorName, averageRating
LIMIT 10
----

You should obtain something similar to this:

=== Single Value card

The **Single Value** visualization type is perfect for highlighting a key metric. It allows you to display a single data point prominently, making it easy to focus on important information.

Create a single value card to show the total number of movies in the instance:

Execute the following Cypher query in the card editor to get the results:

[source,cypher ]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN COUNT(n) as Total
----

You should obtain something similar to this:

image::images/single-card.png[Single Value card example,width=600,align=center]

If you have obtained a different value, don't worry! The data in your instance may vary based on other activities you have performed.

=== Text card

This visualization type is useful for adding descriptive information or context to your dashboard. It allows you to include text elements that can provide explanations, titles, or any other relevant information, written in markdown format.

Text cards provide a practical way to add context to your dashboard and help stakeholders understand the data being presented. They also enable generating a local overview of all dashboards in one place by inserting images of each dashboard.

For example, create a text card to describe the purpose of your favourite movie, in this example, __The Matrix__:

Copy and paste the following markdown text into the card editor:

[source,markdown]
----

*Challenge:* Use your creativity to add more text cards to your dashboard, providing context and insights about the data being visualized.


=== Visualising aggregated data

You have now seen multiple ways to visualize aggregated data using different card types in Neo4j Dashboards.

When working with aggregated data, it's important to choose the right visualization type that effectively communicates the insights you want to convey. Consider the following factors when selecting a card type:

1. **Data Granularity**: Understand the level of detail in your data. Some visualizations work better with high-level aggregates, while others are more suited for detailed breakdowns.

2. **Audience**: Consider who will be viewing the dashboard. Tailor your visualizations to the needs and preferences of your audience.

3. **Context**: Provide context for your visualizations. Use text cards to explain the significance of the data and highlight key insights.

4. **Interactivity**: Leverage interactive features, such as filters and drill-downs, to allow users to explore the data further.

*Hands on challenge:*
Create a new dashboard for the marketing team to visualize movie insights. Build cards that show:

* Total number of movies per genre (helps identify content gaps)
* Average movie ratings per decade (shows trends in content quality)
* Top 5 directors with the highest average movie ratings (identifies successful content creators)

Use the appropriate card types to represent each metric effectively, and add text cards to provide context and explanations for the visualizations. These insights will help the marketing team make data-driven decisions about content and acquisition.

Share your dashboard with your peers and discuss the choices you made for each visualization, or post it on our community forum for feedback link:https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j Community^].


If you are new to data aggregation, these metrics will help you get started.

Run the following Cypher queries to get the aggregated data for each metric, in a separate card each time. Feel free to choose the visualization type that best represents the data.

* Count metrics: Total number of nodes or relationships that meet specific criteria.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN count(m) AS total_movies
----

* Average metrics: The average value of a specific property across a set of nodes or relationships.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
RETURN g.name AS genre,
    avg(toFloat(m.rating)) AS average_rating,
    count(m) AS total_movies
ORDER BY average_rating DESC
----



video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-dashboards-videos/first-card-average-rating-by-genre.mp4["First Card - Average Rating by Genre",role="cdn", width=100%]

* Distribution metrics: The spread of values for a specific property across nodes or relationships.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.rating IS NOT NULL
RETURN m.rating AS rating,
    count(*) AS count
ORDER BY rating DESC
----

[TIP]
.Reusing queries for recommendation insights

====
Reuse the Cypher queries provided in this lesson to create multiple cards with different visualization types for your movie recommendation dashboards.
For example, create both a bar chart and a pie chart using the same query to visualize the distribution of movie ratings from different perspectives.
Also, feel free to modify the queries to explore different aspects of your recommendation data. Cypher functions like `count()`, `avg()`, and `sum()` can be very useful for aggregating data about movies, actors, and user preferences.
====


[NOTE]
.Security and access control
====
Security applies to dashboards based on the access control permissions assigned to users. If a user's role does not allow viewing certain data, they will not see that data in the dashboard. Users will only see data they have permission to access based on their role.
