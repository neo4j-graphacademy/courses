====
Aggregated data (like counts, averages, sums) summarizes information to reveal patterns and trends. For recommendation systems, this helps identify which genres are popular, which actors drive engagement, and how user preferences change over time—insights that aren't visible when looking at individual records.

====
**To identify trends and patterns in genre popularity that help with content recommendations.**

Visualizing aggregated data (like total movies per genre, average ratings per decade, or top-rated directors) helps you identify trends and patterns that aren't apparent from individual records. For your movie recommendation system, these insights help stakeholders make data-driven decisions about which content to recommend, which genres to focus on, and how user preferences evolve over time.
