====
The AI tool generates visualizations based on natural language descriptions. You describe what insights you want to see (like "movies by genre and ratings"), and the AI creates the corresponding dashboard cards and Cypher queries automatically.

.Solution
====
**A natural language description of what you want to visualize.**

To use the AI tool in Neo4j Dashboards, provide a natural language description of the insights you want to see. For example, "Show movies by genre and their average ratings" or "Visualize actor relationships in movies." The AI will generate the Cypher queries and create the visualization cards automatically. You don't need to write queries yourself when using AI, though you can also write Cypher queries directly if you prefer more control.
