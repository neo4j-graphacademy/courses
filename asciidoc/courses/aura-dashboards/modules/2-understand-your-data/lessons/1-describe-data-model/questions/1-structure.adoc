.Solution
====
The correct options that describe the structure components of your data model are:
* **Properties**: These are key-value pairs that provide additional information about nodes and relationships.
* **Relationships**: These define how nodes are connected to each other in the graph.
* **Nodes**: These are the primary entities in the graph that represent data points.

Instances are not part of the data model structure; they refer to the database instances where the data is stored.
