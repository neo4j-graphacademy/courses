= Understanding your movie data model structure

In your movie recommendation system, you want to visualize how actors are connected to movies. Which components of your graph data model enable you to create these visualizations?

* [x] Nodes (representing entities like Movie and Person)
* [x] Relationships (like ACTED_IN connecting Person to Movie)
* [x] Properties (like title on Movie nodes, name on Person nodes)
* [ ] Instances (these are database containers, not model components)

.Hint
====
A graph data model consists of nodes (entities like Movie, Person), relationships (connections like ACTED_IN), and properties (attributes like title, name). These components define what you can visualize in dashboards. Instances are where the data is stored, not part of the model structure.

.Solution
====
The correct options are:
* **Nodes**: Represent entities in your recommendation system (Movie nodes, Person nodes)
* **Relationships**: Define connections between nodes (ACTED_IN connects actors to movies)
* **Properties**: Provide attributes on nodes and relationships (title on Movie, name on Person, characters on ACTED_IN)

These components define your data model and determine what insights you can visualize in dashboards. Instances are database containers where your data is stored, not components of the data model structure.
