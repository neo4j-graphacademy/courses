:type: lesson
:order: 2


== Lesson Overview
In the previous lesson, you learned about the purpose of Neo4j Aura Dashboards and the benefits of using them for data visualisation.

In this lesson, you will learn about how to access Aura Dashboards, including creating an Aura account, selecting the appropriate tier, and navigating the Dashboards UI.

     
== Getting Access to Aura Dashboards

To explore the Dashboards UI, you need an Aura account, and an instance to connect to. 

Create an account and an instance by following these instructions:


== Step 1: Visit the Neo4j Aura Website

If you already have an Aura account and an instance, you can skip to **Step 4.**

Go to link:https://console.neo4j.io[console.neo4j.io^] in your web browser. This is the official portal for managing Neo4j Aura databases.

On this page, you will see options to sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.

Use the **Sign Up** button to create a new account.

For more information please check the docs: link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/classic/auradb/getting-started/create-database/[https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/classic/auradb/getting-started/create-database/].


== Step 2: Create Your Account

After clicking the **Sign Up** button, you will be directed to the registration form. After filling in your email address, you have to confirm your identity before proceeding to make sure it is a valid email address and not a bot or impersonation.

== Step 3: Create an Aura Instance

(Optional) Once you have an account, *create a new Aura instance* by selecting the desired tier (Free, Professional, Business Critical, or Virtual Dedicated Cloud) based on your requirements. 


In this course, you will only need the **Free tier** to explore and learn about Aura Dashboards.

== Dashboard allocation per tier

In Aura Dashboards, you have access to different types of layouts to visualise your graph data effectively. The main types of layouts available are:

* Free tier: 3 dashboard pages available. If you have already created a free tier instance, you can access upgrade at any time to access more dashboards.

* Professional, Enterprise and Visual Dedicated Cloud: 25 dashboard pages available.

== Step 4: Connect to an instance

. *Log in* to your Aura instance, and go to the  *Dashboards* menu. From there, you can create new dashboards, access existing ones, and manage your dashboard settings.

. *Connect to your instance* by selecting it from the list of available instances. You can either connect to an Aura instance, or to a local Neo4j database if you have one, by entering the connection details. For more information, please check the docs: link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/classic/auradb/manage-database/connect/[https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/classic/auradb/manage-database/connect/].

After you click on **Connect to instance**, you will be prompted to enter the connection details, for either Aura or a Self managed database. In this course, you will connect to your Aura instance for simplicity:

You can find the connection details of your Aura instance by clicking on the **...** menu next to your instance name, and selecting **Inspect**, or by using the downloaded connection details file.
