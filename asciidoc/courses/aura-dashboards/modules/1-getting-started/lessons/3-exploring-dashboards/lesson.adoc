== Load data into your instance

Dashboards visualize data from your Neo4j instance. Before creating dashboards, load sample data using the provided Cypher script.

=== Step 1: Open the Query tool

=== Step 3: Verify the data

Run this command to view the database schema:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization
----

This will display a visualization of the database schema, showing the nodes and relationships that have been created.

In the Explore tab, you need to search for a node label or use the _Show a graph snippet_ button in the empty state to view part of the graph.

Once the script has finished running, you will see a summary of the nodes and relationships created in your Aura instance. 

Go to the Explore tab to visualize and explore the data you have just loaded:
