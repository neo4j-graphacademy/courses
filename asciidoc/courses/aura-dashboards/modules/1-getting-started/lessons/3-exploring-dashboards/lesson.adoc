= Exploring Dashboards
:type: lesson
:order: 3

Dashboards visualize data from your Neo4j instance. To build dashboards for your movie recommendation system, you first need to load data and generate a demo dashboard.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Load the movie recommendations dataset into your instance
* Generate your first dashboard using AI
* Explore the Dashboards interface

== Loading the movie recommendations dataset

Before creating dashboards for your movie recommendation system, load the movie recommendations dataset using the provided Cypher script.

[NOTE]
.Movie data
====
The sample data should be _loaded_ into your database using the provided Cypher script, not the Import service.
====

The Movies dataset contains movies, actors, directors, genres, and ratings—exactly what you need to build dashboards that visualize insights.

=== Step 1: Open the Query tool

To load data using a Cypher script, connect to the Query tool:

. In the console, click **Query** in the left menu
. Connect to your instance using your credentials
. Enter your connection details in the connection dialog

Any Cypher script you run will execute against the connected Neo4j instance.

=== Step 2: Load the sample data

. Copy the Cypher script below into the Query Editor
. Click **Run** to execute it

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graphacademy/recommendations-extend/refs/heads/main/recommendations-extended/data/cypher/import-recommendations.cypher[]
----

Once the script has finished running, you will see a summary of the nodes and relationships created in your Aura instance.

=== Step 3: Verify the data

Run this command to view the database schema:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization
----

This will display a visualization of the database schema, showing the nodes and relationships that have been created.

In the Query tool results, view the graph visualization of your schema.

Go to the Explore tab to visualize and explore the data you have just loaded:

== Generating your first movie recommendation dashboard

With the movie data loaded, create your first dashboard using the AI tool. This dashboard will visualize insights about your movie recommendation dataset.

. Go to **Dashboards** in the left menu
. Click **Create dashboard** → **Create with AI**
. Read and accept the AI disclaimer
. Enter a prompt describing what you want to visualize about your movie recommendation data, for example: "Visualize movie recommendations based on user ratings and genres" or "Show comedy movies and their ratings"
. Click **Generate**

Take time to explore the different cards and visualizations before continuing to the next lesson.

[TIP]
.Create with AI in Aura
====
The **Create with AI** feature is only available in the Neo4j Aura Console, and not available in Neo4j Desktop.

== Summary

In this lesson, you loaded the movie recommendations dataset into your instance and generated your first dashboard using AI. This dashboard visualizes insights about movies, ratings, and genres that will help stakeholders understand recommendation patterns.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to:

* Describe your movie data model to understand what insights to visualize
* Design dashboards that align with stakeholder requirements for your recommendation system
