= Exploring Dashboards
:type: lesson
:order: 3

== Load data into your Aura instance

To create dashboards in Neo4j Aura, you will need to:

* Connect to a Neo4j database - either Cloud Aura instance or local instance.
* Either upload a CSV file - from local system or from Cloud storage, this requires knowledge of how to Import data.
* OR Run the *import-recommendations.cypher* script provided in this lesson, this will load all the necessary Movies Recommendation dataset nodes and relationships.
* Map properties from the CSV file to the node
* Run the import



=== Step 1: Connect to your database
To connect to your Neo4j Aura instance, open the Import Data tool from the Aura interface.

Use the connection details of your Aura instance to connect.

If you have any existing on-prem Neo4j database, you can also connect to it by entering the connection details.


If you have an existing data importer model, you can clear it by selecting the `Clear all` option from the menu `...`.

Any data import you run will be against the connected Neo4j database.

=== Step 2: Navigate to the Query Editor

After connecting to your Aura instance, you will need to navigate to the Query Editor in order to load data using Cypher.

At this point, you do not need to understand Cypher in detail; you will only run the script that loads the data.

=== Step 3: Import the Movies Recommendation dataset

Use the following Cypher script to create the Movies Recommendation dataset in your Aura instance:

link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/recommendations-extend/blob/main/recommendations-extended/data/cypher/import-recommendations.cypher[import-recommendations.cypher^]

You can copy and paste the script into the Query Editor, and click the **Run** button to execute it.

Once the script has finished running, you will see a summary of the nodes and relationships created in your Aura instance. 

Go to the Explore tab to visualize and explore the data you have just loaded:

// == Importing data from cloud

// Importing data from cloud storage services is a convenient way to manage large datasets, and to ensure data security and accessibility.

// When you go to the Import menu, you will see an option to add a new data source: 


// image::images/import-menu.png[The data source importing UI]

// In this example, you will learn how to import data from an S3 bucket. If you have other cloud storage services, the steps are similar:

// * Set up access credentials: You might need to create an access key and secret key to authenticate your access to the cloud storage service. If you are using AWS S3, you can create an IAM user with the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket.
// * Configure the data source in Data Importer: In the Data Importer interface, select the option to add a new data source and choose the cloud storage service you are using.

// * You will need to provide the access credentials and the path to the data files, and make sure the bucket and files are accessible from Data Importer.

// To import data from an S3 bucket, you will need to provide the following information:

// * Access Key: Your AWS access key ID.
// * Secret Key: Your AWS secret access key.

// * Bucket Name: The name of the S3 bucket containing the data files.
// * File Path: The path to the data files within the S3 bucket.

== Generating a demo dashboard using AI


Once you have successfully loaded the data into your Aura instance, you can generate a demo dashboard using the AI tool.

You will learn more about creating and managing dashboards in the next lessons, but for now, let's see how to quickly generate a dashboard using AI. 

Prior to using the AI tool, ensure that you have read the AI disclaimer available in the Aura Dashboards interface:

From the Dashboards menu, click on the **Create dashboard** dropdown, and select **Create with AI**.

In the prompt dialog, enter a description of the insights you want to visualize. For example, you can enter a description like "Visualize movie recommendations based on user ratings and genres.", or simply "Comedy movies": 

image::images/create-with-ai-prompt.png[Create dashboard with AI prompt,width=600,align=center]


After you run the prompt, the AI will generate a dashboard based on your description: 

image::images/ai-dashboard.png[AI generated dashboard,width=600,align=center]

In this dashboard, you can see various visualizations such as single values, bar charts, pie charts, and graph visualizations that provide insights into movie recommendations based on user ratings and genres. You will learn more about each type of chart in the following lessons.

Use the graph visualisation to explore the relationships between users, movies, and genres interactively:

Before moving to the next lesson, take your time to explore the different cards and visualisations generated by the AI tool.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to sign up for a Neo4j Aura account and set up your first Aura instance connection. You have also learned how to load data into your Aura instance using a Cypher script, validate the import, and generated a demo dashboard using our AI tool.

In the next lesson, you will dive into how to create and manage a dashboard in Aura using different visualisations and AI-powered features.
