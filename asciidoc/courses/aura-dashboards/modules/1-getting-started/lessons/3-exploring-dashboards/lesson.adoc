= Exploring Dashboards
:type: lesson
:order: 3

In the previous lesson you connected to your instance from the Dashboards UI. In this lesson you will learn:

* How to load the Movies dataset into your instance
* How to create your first dashboard with AI
* How to explore the Dashboards interface

You will have a dashboard ready to build on in the next module.

== Loading the Movies dataset

Load the Movies dataset before creating dashboard cards. Download the script from the link below, then run it in the Query tool.

[NOTE]
.If you need to create an Aura account
====
If you don't have a Neo4j Aura account yet, see the link:/courses/aura-fundamentals/1-introduction/3-sign-up/[Sign up for Aura lesson^] in the Aura Fundamentals course for detailed step-by-step instructions on creating an account and setting up your first instance.
====

[NOTE]
.Movie data
====
The sample data should be _loaded_ into your database using the Movies Cypher script linked in Step 2 below, not the Import service.
====

The Movies dataset contains movies, actors, directors, genres, and ratings. That is exactly what you need to build dashboards that visualize insights.

=== Step 1: Open the Query tool

To load data using a Cypher script, connect to the Query tool:

. In the console, click **Query** in the left menu
. Connect to your instance using your credentials
. Enter your connection details in the connection dialog

Any Cypher script you run will execute against the connected Neo4j instance.

=== Step 2: Load the sample data

. Download the Movies dataset script: link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graph-examples/movies/main/scripts/movies.cypher[movies.cypher^]. Alternatively, open link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/movies/blob/main/scripts/movies.cypher[on GitHub^] and click **Raw** to copy the script.
. Copy the script contents into the Query Editor
. Click **Run** to execute it

Once the script has finished running, you will see a summary of the nodes and relationships created in your Aura instance.

=== Step 3: Verify the data

Run this command to view the database schema:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization
----

This will display a visualization of the database schema, showing the nodes and relationships that have been created.

In the Query tool results, view the graph visualization of your schema.

Go to the Explore tab to visualize and explore the data you have just loaded:

== Creating your first dashboard with AI

With the Movies data loaded, create your first dashboard using AI.

. Go to **Dashboards** in the left menu
. Click **Create dashboard** → **Create with AI**
. Read and accept the AI disclaimer
. Enter a prompt describing what you want to see, such as "Movies by genre and average ratings" or "Comedy movies and their ratings"
. Click **Generate**

Take time to explore the different cards and visualizations before continuing to the next lesson.

[TIP]
.Create with AI in Aura
====
The **Create with AI** feature is only available in the Neo4j Aura Console, and not available in Neo4j Desktop.
====

*Challenge*

Load the Movies dataset when you do not already have it, then create your first dashboard with AI. Use a prompt that asks for something specific, such as "Average rating by genre" or "Actors and the movies they acted in." Explore the cards the AI generates, then add one more card with a different prompt, for example "Top 10 rated movies." When you are done, you are ready for the next module.

== Summary

You loaded the Movies dataset and created your first dashboard with AI. In the next module you will describe the graph model, add more cards with AI and Cypher, and style your movies dashboard.
