== Loading the movie recommendations dataset

Dashboards visualize data from your Neo4j instance. Before creating dashboards for your movie recommendation system, load the movie recommendations dataset using the provided Cypher script.

The Movies dataset contains movies, actors, directors, genres, and ratings—exactly what you need to build dashboards that visualize insights.

=== Step 1: Open the Query tool

. In the console, click **Query** in the left menu
. Connect to your instance using your credentials
. Enter your connection details in the connection dialog

=== Step 2: Load the sample data

. Download the import script:

. Copy and paste the script into the Query Editor
. Click **Run** to execute it

=== Step 3: Verify the data

Run this command to view the database schema:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization
----

This will display a visualization of the database schema, showing the nodes and relationships that have been created.

In the Query tool results, view the graph visualization of your schema.

Once the script has finished running, you will see a summary of the nodes and relationships created in your Aura instance. 



Go to the Explore tab to visualize and explore the data you have just loaded:

== Generating your first movie recommendation dashboard

With the movie data loaded, create your first dashboard using the AI tool. This dashboard will visualize insights about your movie recommendation dataset.

. Go to **Dashboards** in the left menu
. Click **Create dashboard** → **Create with AI**
. Read and accept the AI disclaimer
. Enter a prompt describing what you want to visualize about your movie recommendation data, for example: "Visualize movie recommendations based on user ratings and genres" or "Show comedy movies and their ratings"
. Click **Generate**
