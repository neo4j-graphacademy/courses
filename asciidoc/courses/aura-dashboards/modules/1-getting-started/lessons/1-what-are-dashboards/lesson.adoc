== Understanding Data Visualization 

Welcome to the Neo4j Dashboards course on GraphAcademy!

Ever wondered how movie recommendation systems work, or how studios track which genres are trending? 

Representing data in a visual format helps uncover patterns that might not be immediately apparent. 

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Understand what Neo4j Dashboards are and when to use them
* Access Dashboards by importing sample data
* Create interactive dashboards using our GenAI assistant and natural language
* Build dashboard cards with Cypher queries
* Add filters to make dashboards dynamic

== What you will need

To follow along with this course, you will need:

* A Neo4j instance (Aura or Desktop)
* Basic understanding of graph databases, data modeling, and Cypher query language (optional)

If you are new to Neo4j, familiarize yourself with the following courses:

== Introducing Neo4j Dashboards

Neo4j Dashboards is a tool for visualizing and exploring your graph data. Use the **Natural Language** feature in the card editor to ask questions about your data, and Neo4j Dashboards will generate the Cypher queries and visualizations for you.

Throughout this course, you will use the Movies dataset as an example. If you are running a streaming service, you might want to track metrics such as ratings per country, genre, and actors to understand user engagement and preferences.

The picture below shows a sample dashboard that visualizes movie data sorted by decade, represented as a line chart:

Use dashboards when you need: 

* Visual representation of patterns and trends
* Real-time data monitoring vs. static reports comparisons
* Different stakeholder perspectives on the same data
* Easy sharing of insights across teams
* Interactive exploration of data without writing code

In this course, you will learn how to build dashboards similar to the one below:
