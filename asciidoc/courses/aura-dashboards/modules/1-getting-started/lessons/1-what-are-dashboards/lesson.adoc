== What are Neo4j Dashboards?

This course teaches you how to build interactive dashboards using the Movies dataset.
Dashboards transform this data into visual insights that answer questions such as:

* Which genres are trending this year?
* Which actors appear in the most highly-rated movies?
* How do ratings and popularity change over time?
* What patterns exist in movie-actor relationships?

In this lesson, you will learn:

* What Neo4j Dashboards are
* When to use dashboards
* How dashboards fit into your workflow

== What you will need

To follow along with this course, you will need:

* A Neo4j instance (Aura or Desktop)
* Basic understanding of graph databases, data modeling, and Cypher query language (optional)

If you are new to Neo4j, familiarize yourself with the following courses:

== Introducing Neo4j Dashboards

Neo4j Dashboards is a tool for visualizing and exploring your graph data. Using the Movies dataset, you'll learn to build dashboards that visualize insights about movies, actors, ratings, and relationships.

Use the **Natural Language** feature in the card editor to ask questions about your movie data (e.g., "Show movies by decade" or "Visualize actor relationships"), and Neo4j Dashboards will generate the Cypher queries and visualizations for you.

**The Movies dataset:** Throughout this course, you'll work with the same Movies dataset used in the Neo4j Fundamentals, Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals, and Aura Fundamentals courses. This dataset contains information about movies, actors, directors, genres, and ratings—perfect for building dashboards.

The picture below shows a sample dashboard that visualizes movie data sorted by decade, helping you understand how movie production has changed over time:

Dashboards help you:

* Visualize patterns in ratings and movie popularity
* Monitor trends in genre preferences and actor collaborations
* Share insights with stakeholders (content teams, marketing, executives)
* Explore data interactively without writing complex queries
* Make data-driven decisions based on visual insights

In this course, you will learn how to build dashboards similar to the one below using the Movies dataset:
