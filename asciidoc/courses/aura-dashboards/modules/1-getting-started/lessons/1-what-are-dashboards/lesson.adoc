== Your Mission: Building Dashboards for Movie Recommendations

Welcome to the Neo4j Dashboards course on GraphAcademy!

**Your mission:** Build interactive dashboards for a movie recommendation system that help stakeholders understand user preferences, movie trends, and actor relationships. These dashboards will visualize insights that drive content recommendations and business decisions.

**Why dashboards for recommendations?** Movie recommendation systems generate data about user ratings, viewing patterns, and content preferences. Dashboards transform this data into visual insights that answer questions like:
* Which genres are trending this year?
* Which actors appear in the most highly-rated movies?
* How do user preferences change over time?
* What content should we recommend to users?

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Build dashboards that visualize movie recommendation insights
* Create interactive dashboards using AI and Cypher queries
* Visualize relationships between movies, actors, and users
* Share dashboards with stakeholders to enable data-driven decisions

== What you will need

To follow along with this course, you will need:

* A Neo4j instance (Aura or Desktop)
* Basic understanding of graph databases, data modeling, and Cypher query language (optional)

If you are new to Neo4j, familiarize yourself with the following courses:

== Introducing Neo4j Dashboards

Neo4j Dashboards is a tool for visualizing and exploring your graph data. For your movie recommendation system, you'll use dashboards to visualize insights about movies, actors, ratings, and user preferences.

**How it works:** Use the **Natural Language** feature in the card editor to ask questions about your movie data (e.g., "Show movies by decade" or "Visualize actor relationships"), and Neo4j Dashboards will generate the Cypher queries and visualizations for you.

**The Movies dataset:** Throughout this course, you'll work with the same Movies dataset used in the Neo4j Fundamentals, Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals, and Aura Fundamentals courses. This dataset contains information about movies, actors, directors, genres, and user ratings—perfect for building recommendation dashboards.

The picture below shows a sample dashboard that visualizes movie data sorted by decade, helping you understand how movie production has changed over time:

**Why dashboards for recommendations?** Dashboards help you:

* Visualize patterns in user ratings and movie popularity
* Monitor trends in genre preferences and actor collaborations
* Share insights with stakeholders (content teams, marketing, executives)
* Explore data interactively without writing complex queries
* Make data-driven decisions about content recommendations

In this course, you will learn how to build dashboards similar to the one below, tailored for your movie recommendation system:
