= Sharing Dashboards
:type: lesson
:order: 1

In the previous lessons, you learned how to create interactive dashboards using AI and Cypher queries.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

* Share dashboards with specific users
* Enable access to dashboards to everyone in your project

[NOTE]
.For Self-Managed users
====
The examples in this lesson focus on Neo4j Aura's sharing features. If you're using Self-Managed Enterprise Edition, work with your administrator to manage dashboard access using your organization's user management system.

== Sharing your dashboards

To share a dashboard: 

. Open the dashboard you want to share.
. Click the **Share** button at the top right. 
. In the **Share dashboard** dialog:
* **Invite specific users** by entering their email addresses.
* **Set project level access** to allow everyone in the project to access the dashboard.
* Click **Send Invites** to send the invitations.

== Understanding user roles

When sharing dashboards, it's important to understand the different user roles and what permissions they have:

* **Organisation Admin**: Has full access to all projects and instances within the organization. Can manage users, billing, and organization settings.
* **Project Admin**: Has full access to all instances within a specific project. Can manage users and project settings.
* **Project Member**: Has read and write access to instances within a specific project but cannot manage users or settings.
* **Project Viewer**: Has read-only access to instances within a specific project. Cannot make any changes to the instance or settings.
* **Metrics Reader**: The only role that cannot view Dashboards. Metrics Reader has access to view performance metrics and monitoring data for instances within a specific project. Cannot make any changes to the instance or settings.

[NOTE]
.Console access vs. instance access
====
Access to the Console is **not** the same as access to the instances.
Console access allows users to create and manage instances, but it doesn't directly control access to the data within those instances.

When you create a new instance, you will be supplied with a separate set of credentials to access the instance.

== Sharing dashboads via email invitation

Confirm that the users you invited have accepted the invitation to join your project, and have a VIEWER role.

Once you have confirmed that the users have access to your project, share the dashboard with them by sending an email invitation: 

image::images/invite-dashboard-viewer.png[invite dashboard viewer,width=600,align=center]

After clicking the **Invite** button, the users will receive an email invitation to access the dashboard, and will be able to view all your pages created in that dashboard.

== Setting general project access

To allow everyone in your project to have access to the dashboards, set the project level access:

This scenario is useful when you want to share dashboards with a larger group of users without inviting them individually.
