= Final Project: Build Your Stakeholders Dashboard
:type: challenge
:order: 3

In this lesson you will apply what you learned by building a stakeholders dashboard for the scenario below.

== Project Overview

**Scenario:** Design a dashboard for a streaming service to support content acquisition decisions. The dashboard will serve three stakeholder groups: executives, marketing team, and content acquisition team.

**Dataset:** Use the Movies dataset you loaded earlier in this course (movies, actors, directors, genres, ratings).

**Suggested steps:**

. Add a page or cards that answer: Which genres have the most movies? Average rating by genre?
. Add a card that shows top-rated movies or directors with highest average ratings.
. Add at least one filter so stakeholders can change what is displayed (for example, filter by person name or genre).
. Share the dashboard with a colleague or mark it complete and review the cards you built.
