= Add cards and filters
:type: lesson
:order: 2

In the previous lesson you described the Movies graph model and mapped stakeholder questions to the data. Use the dashboard you created in link:/courses/aura-dashboards/1-getting-started/3-exploring-dashboards/[Exploring Dashboards^]. If you have not loaded the Movies data or created a dashboard yet, complete that lesson first.

In this lesson you will learn:

* How to add cards to your existing dashboard using AI prompts
* How to add a card with a Cypher query for precise control
* How to edit cards and add a filter so viewers can change what is displayed

== Open your dashboard and add a card

Open your movies dashboard from the **Dashboards** menu. You will add new cards and a filter to it.

Before creating your dashboard, make sure your instance contains the sample movie data. If you haven't done that yet, go back to link:/courses/aura-dashboards/1-getting-started/3-exploring-dashboards/[lesson 3 - Exploring Dashboards^] in the Getting Started module and follow the steps to load the data.

Go to the **Dashboards** tool and click **Create with AI** to begin.

Enter a description of the insights you want to visualize. For example, you can enter a description like "Visualize actor relationships in movies." or simply "Actor relationships":

[TIP]
.Be specific
====
Be specific about the node labels and relationship types to ensure accurate results.
====

Create a new AI generated dashboard by clicking the "Generate with AI" button, which will prompt you to enter a description of the insights you want to visualize. The AI will then generate a dashboard based on your description:

You should have a dashboard that looks similar to this:

== Adding more cards

Dashboard cards are individual components that display specific data visualizations.

Click **Add a card** to create your next visualization:

You can create cards using AI prompts or Cypher queries. To create a card with AI, use the natural language feature in the card editor:

== Adding a card with Cypher

For precise control over the result, add a card that runs a Cypher query. Click **Add a card**, then in the card editor:

* Change the card title from "New card" to something descriptive like "Actor Overview"
* Select **Graph** from the visualization type dropdown
* Paste your Cypher query into the Query field

For example, create a card that shows which movies Tom Hanks has acted in:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p,r,m
----

video::https://cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/aura-dashboards-videos/first-card-cypher-tom-hanks.mp4["First Card with Cypher - Tom Hanks",role="cdn", width=100%]

Your dashboard will display a graph visualization showing Tom Hanks and his movie connections.

[TIP]
.Repositioning cards
====
Move cards by dragging them using the six-dot handle that appears when you hover over a card.
====

== Editing a card

Change a card by clicking the three-dot menu on the card and selecting **Edit card**.

Make the changes you want, then click **Save changes** to update the card.

== Adding a filter

Filters allow users to dynamically change what data is displayed without modifying queries.

To add a filter to your dashboard, go to the dashboard view and select **Add filter**:

image::images/04_dashboard_tool_filter.jpg[dashboard_filter,width=300,align=center]

For example, create a "Person selection" filter that will control which actor's data is displayed.

Now update your Actor Overview card query to use the filter parameter:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = $person_name
RETURN p,r,m
----

Save your changes and test the filter:

image::images/04_dashboard_tool_selection.jpg[dashboard_selection,width=500,align=center]

Your dashboard now responds dynamically to filter selections:

== Where dashboards fit in your workflow

The dashboard tool enables:

* Quick data exploration and validation
* Creating presentations
* Building operational monitoring dashboards
* Prototyping before investing in custom applications
