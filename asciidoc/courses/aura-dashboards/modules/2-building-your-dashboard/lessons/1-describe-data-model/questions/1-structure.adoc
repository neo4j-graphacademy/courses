= Understanding your movie data model structure

You want to visualize how actors are connected to movies in the Movies graph. Which parts of the graph data model do you use to build that visualization?

* [x] Nodes, which represent entities such as Movie and Person
* [x] Relationships, such as ACTED_IN connecting Person to Movie
* [x] Properties, such as title on Movie nodes and name on Person nodes
* [ ] Instances, which are database containers and not part of the model

.Hint
====
A graph data model consists of nodes, which represent entities such as Movie and Person; relationships, which are connections such as ACTED_IN; and properties, which are attributes such as title and name. These components define what you can visualize in dashboards. Instances are where the data is stored; they are not part of the model structure.

.Solution
====
The correct options are:

* **Nodes:** Represent entities such as Movie nodes and Person nodes
* **Relationships:** Define connections between nodes; for example, ACTED_IN connects actors to movies
* **Properties:** Provide attributes on nodes and relationships, such as title on Movie, name on Person, and characters on ACTED_IN

These components define your data model and determine what insights you can visualize in dashboards. Instances are database containers where your data is stored, not components of the data model structure.
