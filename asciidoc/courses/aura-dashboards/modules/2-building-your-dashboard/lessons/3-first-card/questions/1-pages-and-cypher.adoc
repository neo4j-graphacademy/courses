= Adding a card with Cypher

You want a card that shows one specific actor and the movies they acted in. You already have the Cypher query and need the card to run exactly that query. How should you add the card?

* [ ] Describe the card in natural language in the card editor so the AI generates a query for that actor.
* [x] Add a card, open the card editor, and paste your Cypher into the Query field.
* [ ] Open the Results overview for an existing card and paste your Cypher there.
* [ ] Create a new dashboard and pick a template that includes actor-movie cards.

.Hint
====
The card editor has a Query field for running Cypher. The Results overview is for styling how results look, not for setting the query. Natural language would let the AI choose the query, which is not what you want here.

.Solution
====
**Add a card, open the card editor, and paste your Cypher into the Query field.**

When you have a specific Cypher query and want the card to run it unchanged, use the Query field in the card editor. Use natural language when you are okay with the AI generating the query. Use the Results overview to change colors and labels, not to enter Cypher.
