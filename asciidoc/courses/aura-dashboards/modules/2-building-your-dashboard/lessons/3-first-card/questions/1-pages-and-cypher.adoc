= Cypher

You want to add a card that shows which movies a specific actor has acted in, and you need the exact result set that a Cypher query returns. What should you do?

* [ ] Use the AI natural language prompt only; it always produces the same query.
* [x] Click Add a card, open the card editor, and paste your Cypher query into the Query field.
* [ ] Create a new dashboard from a template that includes actor-movie cards.
* [ ] Use the Results overview to type a Cypher query.

.Hint
====
The card editor has a Query field where you can paste or write Cypher. For precise control over which nodes and relationships are returned, use Cypher in the card editor rather than natural language.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Click Add a card, open the card editor, and paste your Cypher query into the Query field.**

Cards can be created with AI using natural language or with Cypher. When you need exact control over the result set, for example to show a specific actor's movies, you add a card, open the card editor, and put your Cypher in the Query field. Styling is done in the Results overview using labels, colors, and captions, not by typing Cypher there.
