= Choosing a visualization type

Your Cypher query returns one row per genre with `genreName` and `movieCount`, for example Drama 42 and Action 31. You want to compare how many movies are in each genre at a glance. Which visualization type is most appropriate?

* [ ] Graph, to show relationships between genres
* [ ] Table, to list every genre and count
* [x] Bar Chart, to compare quantities across categories
* [ ] Single Value, to show one number

.Hint
====
Bar Chart is for comparing quantities across categories. When you have category labels and a count (or other measure) per category, a bar chart makes comparisons easy to see. Pie Chart shows proportions of a whole; Table shows detailed rows; Single Value shows one metric.

.Solution
====
**Bar Chart (to compare quantities across categories).**

Bar Chart is suited to category and quantity data, such as genre and movie count. It makes it easy to compare values across categories. Use Pie Chart when you want proportions of a whole, Table for detailed row-by-row data, and Single Value when you have one key number to highlight.
