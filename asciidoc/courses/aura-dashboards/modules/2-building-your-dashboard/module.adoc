= Building your movies dashboard
:order: 2

This module builds on the dashboard you created in Getting Started. You describe the data model, add more cards and a filter, organize pages and styling, then add aggregations and chart types.

In this module you will:

* Describe the Movies graph model so you know what to query
* Add cards with AI and Cypher and add a filter
* Organize dashboard pages and style cards
* Add aggregations and choose chart types for ratings, genres, and actors

By the end of this module you will have a working movies dashboard you can share in the next module.
