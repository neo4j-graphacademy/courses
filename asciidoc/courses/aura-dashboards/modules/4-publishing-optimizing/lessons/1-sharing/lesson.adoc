= Shared Responsibility
:type: lesson
:order: 1

In the previous lesson, you learned about Aura and how it differs from self-managed databases.

In this lesson, you will learn about the different responsibilities of Aura and its users.

image::images/01_shared_responsibility.jpg[Shared Responsibility Model]

Aura operates on a shared responsibility model, where Neo4j handles the operational aspects of the database while users focus on their applications and data. This model allows you to benefit from the power of Neo4j without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

== Understanding the Aura Console

The Aura Console is the web-based interface for managing your Neo4j Aura instances.
It provides a user-friendly way to create, configure, and monitor your database instances, as well as manage your organization and project settings.

== Understanding the console hierarchy

When you create a new account, you are automatically assigned to an organization.
A user can be a member of multiple organizations, each of which contains a project.
Each project may contain multiple database instances.

== Console organization

The Aura Console is organized into two main levels: **organization** and **project**.

You can view and change your current organization and project in the top left corner.

By default, you will be assigned to an organization called **Neo4j**, with a project called **New project**.

== Managing organizations

Aura organizes your graph databases into a three-level hierarchy: organizations, projects, and instances.

**Organizations** are the control center for managing global settings and user role access.

**Projects** is used to group database instances.

**Instances** are the actual Neo4j database instances where your data is stored and managed.

To access organization-level settings, click on the **Neo4j** part of the **Neo4j / New project** section at the top.

== Managing organization settings


To begin customizing your organization, select **Settings** from the menu on the left.

image::images/01_aura_console_organization_settings.jpg[settings,width=600,align=center]



== Updating the organization name

You can update the organization name by clicking the pencil icon next to the organization name, typing the new name, and clicking the tick when you are done.

== Managing organization users

The other settings control what features are allowed or restricted at the organization level.
Under **Users**, you can manage who has access to the console for your organization.
Paid tiers offer additional user management options.

[NOTE]
.Console access vs. database access
====
Access to the Aura Console is **not** the same as access to the database instances.
Console access allows users to create and manage database instances, but it doesn't directly control access to the data within those databases.

When you create a new database instance, you will be supplied with a separate set of credentials to access the database.
====


== Managing project settings

You can manage control and permissions for database instances in project settings.
//For example, you can create separate projects for **Development** and **Production**, or **Non-critical** and **Critical** workloads.

[NOTE]
.Multiple Project Availability
====
By default, only one project is provisioned per organization.
Multiple projects are available only on paid tiers.
====



== Customizing the project name

To customize your project name, select **Projects** in the organization menu and click the pencil icon next to the project name.

Click the **Open** button in the project card to view a list of instances.

== Project window

The main console view is project-focused.

The **Data services**, **Operations**, and **Project** sections in the left navigation apply to the current project.

== Aura's Responsibilities

Aura is responsible for the following:

* **Infrastructure Management**: Aura manages the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking.
* **Database Maintenance**: Aura handles database maintenance tasks such as backups, updates, and scaling.
* **Security**: Aura provides security features such as encryption, access control, and compliance with industry standards.

== User Responsibilities

Users are responsible for the following:

* **Data Modeling**: Users must understand Neo4j's graph data model and model their data accordingly.
* **Application Development**: Users are responsible for developing applications that interact with the Neo4j database.
* **Monitoring and Optimization**: Users should monitor their database performance and optimize queries as needed.

By understanding these shared responsibilities, you can effectively manage your Neo4j Aura instances and build successful applications.


== User roles


In addition to the shared responsibilities, it's important to understand the different user roles within an Aura organization:

image::images/1-users-roles.png[Project role drop down showing the different roles available]

* **Organisation Admin**: Has full access to all projects and instances within the organization. Can manage users, billing, and organization settings. You get this role when you create a new Aura account.
* **Project Admin**: Has full access to all instances within a specific project. Can manage users and project settings.
* **Project Member**: Has read and write access to instances within a specific project but cannot manage users or settings.
* **Project Viewer**: Has read-only access to instances within a specific project. Cannot make any changes to the database or settings.
* **Metrics Reader**: Has access to view performance metrics and monitoring data for instances within a specific project. Cannot make any changes to the database or settings.


[NOTE]
====
To learn more about the shared responsibility model, you can refer to the [Neo4j Aura Security Whitepaper](https://neo4j.com/books/neo4j-aura-security/) for a detailed overview of the security measures and responsibilities in Aura.

== Inviting users to your project

To invite users to your project, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Project Settings** page in the Aura console.
2. Click on the **Users** menu.
