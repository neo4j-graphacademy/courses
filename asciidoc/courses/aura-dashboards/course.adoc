Welcome to the Neo4j Dashboards course on GraphAcademy!

This course teaches you how to build interactive dashboards that visualize insights about movies, actors, ratings, and user preferences using the Movies dataset. These dashboards help stakeholders make data-driven decisions about content recommendations, user engagement, and content acquisition.

The Movies dataset contains rich information about movies, actors, and their relationships. Dashboards transform this data into visual insights that help stakeholders understand which movies are trending, which actors drive engagement, and how relationships between movies and actors can be explored.

**What you'll build:** By the end of this course, you'll have a comprehensive dashboard system that visualizes:
* Movie trends and genre popularity
* Actor relationships and collaboration patterns
* User rating distributions and engagement metrics
* Recommendation performance and content insights

This course uses the same Movies dataset from the Neo4j Fundamentals, Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals, and Aura Fundamentals courses, allowing you to build on your existing knowledge.

You will learn how to:

* Access Neo4j Dashboards and connect to your Movies dataset
* Create interactive dashboards using AI and Cypher queries
* Visualize movie data, actor relationships, and user engagement metrics
* Share dashboards with stakeholders to enable data-driven decision making
