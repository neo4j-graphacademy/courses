# What is an Agent?
:order: 1
:type: lesson

An **AI agent** is a system that combines a Large Language Model (LLM) with the ability to take actions in the real world. Unlike a simple chatbot that can only respond with text, an agent can interact with external systems, retrieve information, and execute tasks autonomously.

## Key Components

**LLM Core**: The agent uses an LLM for reasoning, planning, and decision-making.

**Tools**: Agents have access to a set of _tools_ that extend their capabilities beyond text generation. Tools are typically retrievers that can:

* Access databases
* Make API calls to external services
* Undertake File system operations
* Search the web
* Execute code

**Decision Making**: The agent uses the LLM to analyze tasks, determine which tools are needed, and coordinate their use to achieve goals.

## How Agents Work

1. **Receive a task** or query from a user
2. **Plan and reason** using the LLM to break down complex tasks
3. **Select and execute tools** based on what's needed
4. **Observe and process results** and determine next steps
5. **Iterate** until the task is complete or provide a final response

This autonomous capability makes agents particularly powerful for complex, multi-step tasks that require both reasoning and real-world interaction.

## Creating an Agent

You will use Neo4j, Python, and link:https://www.langchain.com/[LangChain^] to build an agent that will use the retrievers you've already learned about as tools.

You will progressively add more tools to the agent, starting with a simple schema introspection tool, then adding document retrieval, and finally text-to-Cypher capabilities.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how agents use reasoning and tools to perform complex tasks autonomously.

In the next lesson, you review a simple Python agent that uses LangChain to interact with Neo4j.
