Welcome to GraphAcademy and the Graph Data Science in Practice workshop.

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to apply graph algorithms to solve real business problems in fraud detection and supply chain optimization.

== What you will learn

* The fundamentals of Graph Data Science and the GDS Project → Run → Write workflow
* How to create graph projections for different analytical questions
* Community detection algorithms (Louvain, WCC) to uncover fraud rings
* Centrality algorithms (PageRank, Betweenness, Degree) to rank influential nodes
* Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, Yen's) to optimize supply chain routes
* Node embeddings (FastRP) for machine learning features
* How to build complete citation analysis pipelines with the Python GDS client
* How to run graph analytics at scale with Aura Graph Analytics

== Prerequisites

Before taking this workshop, you should have:

* Basic understanding of graph databases and Neo4j
* Familiarity with Cypher query language
* Able to read and execute basic queries in Neo4j Browser

We recommend taking the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^] - Learn the basics of graph databases course or the Introduction to Graph Databases workshop.
