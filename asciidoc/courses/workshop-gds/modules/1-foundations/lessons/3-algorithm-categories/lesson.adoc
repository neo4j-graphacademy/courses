== Introduction

Before diving into projections and hands-on work, let's map the landscape.

GDS provides dozens of algorithms across five categories. Each answers a different type of question.

[.slide]
== What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

* Identify the five categories of GDS algorithms and their purposes
* Match analytical questions to the appropriate algorithm category
* Recognize that algorithms compute scores—interpretation requires domain knowledge
* Understand basic graph requirements for different algorithm types

[.slide]
== The Five Categories

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Category | Question | Example Algorithms

| **Centrality**
| Which nodes are most important?
| PageRank, Degree, Betweenness

| **Community Detection**
| What groups exist?
| Louvain, Leiden, WCC

| **Similarity**
| Which nodes are alike?
| Node Similarity, KNN

| **Pathfinding**
| What's the best route?
| Dijkstra, Yen's K-Shortest

| **Node Embeddings**
| How do I represent this for ML?
| FastRP, Node2Vec
|===

[.slide]
== Choosing a Category

Start with your question:

* "Who matters most?" → **Centrality**
* "What groups exist?" → **Community Detection**
* "What's similar to this?" → **Similarity**
* "How do I get from A to B?" → **Pathfinding**
* "How do I use this in ML?" → **Embeddings**

[.slide]
== Algorithms Are Tools

A note on mindset: algorithms don't "find" fraud or "discover" communities.

They compute scores and assignments based on graph structure. **You** decide what those results mean.

Whether a cluster represents a fraud ring, a department, or noise depends on your domain knowledge.

[.slide]
== Algorithm Requirements

Some algorithms have specific graph requirements:

* **Leiden** requires undirected relationships
* **Pathfinding** typically needs weighted relationships
* **Node Similarity** works best on bipartite graphs

You'll learn to configure projections for these requirements.

[.slide]
== What's Ahead

In the next lessons, you'll learn:

* How to create projections
* How graph structure affects algorithms
* Hands-on practice with each category

[.summary]
== Lesson Summary

GDS algorithms fall into five categories:

* **Centrality** — ranking importance
* **Community Detection** — finding groups
* **Similarity** — comparing nodes
* **Pathfinding** — finding routes
* **Node Embeddings** — creating vectors for ML

Your analytical question determines which category to use.
