== Congratulations!

You've completed the **Graph Data Science in Practice** workshop!

In just 4 hours, you've transformed from learning the basics to running sophisticated graph analytics at scale.

== What You've Accomplished

=== Module 1: GDS Foundations

You mastered the fundamentals:

* The GDS Project → Run → Write workflow
* How to create graph projections for different analytical questions
* Algorithm categories and when to use each one
* Execution modes (stream, stats, mutate, write)

=== Module 2: Community Detection for Fraud

You applied algorithms to real fraud detection:

* Used Louvain to find densely connected fraud networks
* Applied WCC for deterministic community assignment
* Filtered noise with Degree Centrality
* Reduced search space by 98% while uncovering hidden fraud rings

=== Module 3: Python GDS Client

You built production-ready workflows:

* Connected to Neo4j and ran algorithms programmatically
* Analyzed citation networks with PageRank and Betweenness Centrality
* Detected research communities with Louvain
* Generated FastRP embeddings for machine learning pipelines

=== Module 4: Aura Graph Analytics

You scaled analytics to the cloud:

* Created ephemeral GDS Sessions for scalable workloads
* Optimized routes with Dijkstra's shortest path
* Found alternative paths with Yen's k-shortest paths
* Learned to run analytics without impacting production databases

== You're Now Ready To

* **Apply GDS to your own datasets** using the skills you've practiced
* **Choose the right algorithms** for different business problems
* **Build production workflows** with the Python GDS client
* **Scale analytics** with Aura Graph Analytics
* **Identify fraud patterns**, optimize logistics, analyze networks, and more
