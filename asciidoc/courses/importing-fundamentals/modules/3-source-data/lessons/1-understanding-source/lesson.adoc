How is the data structured? What is the frequency of updates. Normalised, denormalised - implications of each

Be able to articulate what they need to do before importing data.


Before you start importing data, you should take time to understand the data you are working with, including: 

* Understanding the data structure
* The frequency of updates
* Whether your data is normalized or de-normalized 
* The data quality and whether it needs to be cleaned up before importing







=== Steps for preparing for importing data

Here are the steps you follow to prepare for importing data into Neo4j:

. Understand the data in the source CSV files.
. Inspect and clean (if necessary) the data in the source data files.
. Create or understand the graph data model you will be implementing during the import.



=== IDs must be unique

When you load data from CSV files, you rely heavily upon the IDs specified in the file.
A Neo4j best practice is to use an ID as a unique property value for each node.
If the IDs in your CSV file are not unique for the same entity (node), you will have problems when you load the data and try to create relationships between existing nodes.
