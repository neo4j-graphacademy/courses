:order: 2

In this module, you will learn how to import data into Neo4j using the Neo4j Data Importer.

You will import data about movies and people from CSV files into a graph of `Movie`, `Person`, and `User` nodes.
Relationships between the nodes will allow you to understand which people directed or acted in movies and how users rated movies.

You will create the following data model:
