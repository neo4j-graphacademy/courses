= Leiden algorithm
:type: quiz

[.transcript]
The Leiden algorithm is a community detection algorithm used for identifying communities or groups within a graph.
It was developed as an improvement over the Louvain algorithm, which is another popular community detection algorithm used in network analysis.
It modifies the Louvain algorithm to address some of its shortcomings, namely the case where some of the communities found by Louvain are not well-connected. This is achieved by periodically randomly breaking down communities into smaller well-connected ones.
Overall, the Leiden algorithm has been shown to be more accurate and robust than the Louvain algorithm, especially when dealing with large and complex networks.

The Leiden implementation in Graph Data Science library works on only undirected graph.
Luckily, there exists a `gds.beta.graph.relationships.toUndirected` procedure that can easily transform directed relationships in to undirected ones.

CALL gds.beta.graph.relationships.toUndirected(
  'survey',
  {
    relationshipType: 'SIMILAR',
    mutateRelationshipType: 'UNDIRECTED_SIMILAR'
  }
)
YIELD inputRelationships, relationshipsWritten

Now that we have mutated the similar relationships as undirected, we can go ahead and execute the Leiden algorithm.
In this example, we will write the results of the algorithm back as the **leidenCommunity** property.

CALL gds.beta.leiden.write(
  'survey',
  {
    relationshipTypes: ['UNDIRECTED_SIMILAR'],
    writeProperty:'leidenCommunity'
  }
);

The Leiden algorithm is not deterministic because it uses a randomized approach to group nodes into communities.
The algorithm randomly selects nodes to optimize the modularity score, which can result in different community structures for different runs.
Therefore, you might get different results and different number of communities on each execution.

As a final step, we can evaluate the segments of users that the Leiden algorithm identified.
