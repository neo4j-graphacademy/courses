= Nearest neighbor graph

== Module Overview

In the previous module, you learned about KMeans algorithm and how to use it to perform user segmentation.

This module will introduce a different approach to user segmentation by combining the kNN and Leiden algorithms.

In this module, you will learn:

* Construct a nearest neighbor graph using the kNN algorithm
* How to examine the community structure of a graph using the Leiden algorithm.
