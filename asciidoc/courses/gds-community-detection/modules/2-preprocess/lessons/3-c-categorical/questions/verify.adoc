= Encode the Punctuality value

Your challenge is to encode the `Punctuality` property from text to a numerical value using a Cypher query.

Follow these guidelines:

* Map 'I am often running late' to `1`
* Map 'I am often early' to `3`
* Map 'I am always on time' to `5`

Use the Cypher `CASE` clause to accomplish this task and store the results in a new property `PunctualityEncoding`.

Modify the Cypher statement in the Neo4j Browser window to encode the `Punctuality` variable and store the results as a `PunctualityEncoding` property on the node.

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
You should use the Cypher `CASE` clause to convert the text values into a numerical value and assign the value to the `PunctualityEncoding` property.

.Case Statement
[source,cypher]
----
CASE p['Punctuality']
   WHEN 'i am often running late' THEN 1
   WHEN 'i am often early' THEN 3
   WHEN 'i am always on time' THEN 5
   ELSE 3 END

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The following Cypher statement uses the `CASE` clause to encode the values as an integer and stores the value in the `PunctualityEncoding` property.
