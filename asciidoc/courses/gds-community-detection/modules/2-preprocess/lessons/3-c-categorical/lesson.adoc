= Challenge: Categorical variables
:order: 3
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true


In the previous lesson, you learned how to encode categorical variables.
In examples where the categorical variables can be mapped to numerical ranges, you can use a simple Cypher statement.
When the categorical values cannot be represented as a range of numerical values, you can use one-hot-encoding.

You will now use this knowledge to execute a Cypher query in the integrated Sandbox window to the right of the screen.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated your skills in encoding categorical variables.

In the next challenge, you will use the low variance and high correlation filters to complete a basic dimensionality task.
