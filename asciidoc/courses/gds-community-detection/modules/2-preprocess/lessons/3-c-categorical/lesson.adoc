= Encoding Categorical variables
:order: 3
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

In our last lesson, you gained valuable skills on how to encode categorical variables. You discovered how to utilize Cypher statements to map categorical variables to numerical ranges whenever possible. Additionally, you explored the use of one-hot-encoding, a versatile technique for situations where categorical values cannot be represented as numerical ranges.

Now, it's time to put this newfound knowledge to practice. In the Sandbox window located on the right-hand side of your screen, you will have the opportunity to construct and execute a Cypher query. It's a hands-on opportunity to reinforce what you've learned about encoding categorical variables.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated your skills in encoding categorical variables.

In the next challenge, you will use the low variance and high correlation filters to complete a basic dimensionality task.
