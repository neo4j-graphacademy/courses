= Handling Missing Values

Handling missing values is a common challenge when working with real-world datasets. It's essential to identify these gaps and decide whether to fill them in, a process known as imputation.

== Identifying Missing Values

Our first task is to pinpoint the missing values in our dataset. We'll calculate the ratio of missing values for each property. The Cypher statement below will reveal the top five node properties with the greatest proportion of missing values.

[source,cypher]
MATCH (p:Person)
WITH collect(p) AS personList, count(*) AS totalCount
UNWIND personList AS person
UNWIND keys(person) AS key
WITH key, totalCount, count(person[key]) AS nonNull
RETURN key,
(totalCount - nonNull) / toFloat(totalCount) AS missingValuesRatio
ORDER BY missingValuesRatio DESC
LIMIT 5;
From our initial observations, it seems like our dataset is in pretty good shape! Only a few properties like height, weight, and passive sports show around 2% missing values. Most others are missing less than 1%. As such, we won't spend too much time fretting over these gaps.

== Filling in Missing Values

For a straightforward solution, we'll fill in missing values with the average values of the respective properties for the whole population. Keep in mind, though, that we'll skip categorical variables since we're using averages.

We'll employ the apoc.create.setProperty procedure to dynamically set node properties.

[source,cypher]
MATCH (p:Person)
UNWIND keys(p) AS key
WITH p, key
// filter only numerical values
WHERE toFloat(p[key]) IS NOT NULL
// calculate average
WITH key, avg(p[key]) AS averageValue
MATCH (p1:Person) WHERE p1[key] IS NULL
// Fill in missing values
CALL apoc.create.setProperty(p1, key, averageValue)
YIELD node
RETURN distinct 'done'

== Summary
Great job! You've now mastered the art of identifying and imputing missing values using the average values from the rest of the dataset.
