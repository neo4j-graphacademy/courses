[.question]
= Why are we only filling missing values for numerical properties and not categorical ones in this case?

- [ ] Because Neo4j cannot handle categorical variables.
- [*] Because we're using averages to fill in missing values, which doesn't apply to categorical variables.
- [ ] Because categorical variables never have missing values.
- [ ] Because filling missing values for categorical variables would distort the data.
