= 1. Which metrics can you use to optimize the value of the k parameter?

* [x] `Average distance to centroid`
* [ ] `Node Similarity`
* [x] `Silhoutte score`
* [ ] `Community score`

.Hint
====
The results of the KMeans algorithm can be evaluated by looking the distance between data points and cluster centroid.
The silhoutte score calculates how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
