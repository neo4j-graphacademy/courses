= 2. Which of the following is NOT a scaling method available with the gds.alpha.scaleProperties function?

* [ ] Min-max scaler
* [ ] Max scaler
* [ ] Mean scaler
* [x] Square-root scaler
* [ ] Log scaler


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Review the available scaling options with the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/scale-properties/[]`gds.alpha.scaleProperties` function^].
It provides multiple methods for scaling or normalizing data, but remember, not all possible mathematical transformations are included in the library's options.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The `gds.alpha.scaleProperties` function offers six scaling or normalization methods: Min-max scaler, Max scaler, Mean scaler, Log scaler, Standard Score, and Center.

The Square-root scaler is not included among these options.
