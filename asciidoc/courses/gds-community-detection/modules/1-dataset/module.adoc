= Import and Exploration
:order: 1

This first module will delve into the initial steps of working with our dataset in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library.
We will cover the process of importing data, familiarize ourselves with the dataset through exploratory analysis, and apply what we've learned in an exploration challenge.

We will guide you through importing our dataset into the Neo4j database using the `LOAD CSV` command. This command is a flexible and efficient method for bringing CSV data into Neo4j, a crucial first step for any data analysis task.

Then, we will embark on an exploratory journey into our dataset. Utilizing Cypher queries and the `apoc.agg.statistics` function, we'll uncover key demographic features of our dataset, such as age, height, and weight distributions. This exploration will provide a solid foundation for understanding the data we'll work with through the subsequent modules.

Finally, we present you with an exploration challenge. You will apply your new skills in using `apoc.agg.statistics`` to uncover insights regarding interest in biology within our dataset. This practical exercise will reinforce your understanding of data exploration in Neo4j and illustrate how these techniques can be used to answer real-world questions.
