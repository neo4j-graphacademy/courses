In this hands-on challenge, we'll be using the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/load-csv/[`LOAD CSV`^] command to import our dataset into your Neo4j Sandbox instance.


== Load and Preview the CSV Data

You can load and preview the data in the CSV file without creating any data using the `LOAD CSV` command by passing a `LIMIT`.

.Previewing the CSV
[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasonjo/blog-datasets/main/survey/responses.csv" AS row
RETURN row
LIMIT 5;
----

Running this query will help you to understand the values for the first five rows. After that, you should see numerical values representing the participant's preferences, such as `Happiness in life` and `Metal or Hardrock`, and categorical data, such as `Left - right handed` and `Education`.

You should see the following output in the first row.

.The First Row
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
{
  "Storm": "1",
  "Metal or Hardrock": "1",
  "Psychology": "5",
  "Folk": "1",
  "Public speaking": "5",
  "Gender": "female",
  "History": "1",
  "Unpopularity": "5",
  "Reggae, Ska": "1",
  "Western": "1",
  // ...
  "Left - right handed": "right handed",
  "Loneliness": "3",
  "Country": "2",
  "Hypochondria": "1",
  "Charity": "2",
  // ...
  "Education": "college/bachelor degree",
  "Hiphop, Rap": "1",
  "Musical": "1",
  "Prioritising workload": "2",
  "Rock": "5",
}
----


== Creating Person Nodes

To create one Person node per survey response, run the following Cypher statement:

.Create Person Nodes
[source,cypher]
----
include::solution.cypher[tag=create]
----

1. This line instructs Neo4j to prepare to load a CSV file
2. The first line of the row contains headers
3. The CSV file is remotely hosted on Github.  Assign each row to the `row` variable
4. For each row, create a `(:Person)` node
5. Add a new property for each column in the CSV

You should see the following message:


> Added 1010 labels, created 1010 nodes, set 151500 properties, completed after XXX ms.


You can verify the number of nodes using the `count()` aggregate function.

.Person Count
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN count(p)
----

The statement should return the number 1010.


== Validating the import

You can check that the data has been imported correctly by returning a small sample of the `Age`, `Gender`, and `Assertiveness` properties.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN p.Age AS age,
       p.Gender AS gender,
       p.Assertiveness AS assertiveness
LIMIT 3;
----


=== Converting properties to a float type

You may have noticed that the three properties in the are all string.
Each value loaded using `LOAD CSV` is interpreted as a string. Therefore, if you require a value to be anything other than a string, you must convert the values explicitly.

We must use the `toFloat()` function to convert the numerical values in this case.

The `toFloat()` function accepts a string as a parameter and converts it to a floating point value.
If the value cannot be converted to a float, a *null* value is returned.

.Using toFloat
[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND ["2", "string", Null] AS element
RETURN toFloat(element);
----

.toFloat Results
[Attributes]
|===
| `element` | `toFloat(element)`
|"2"     | `2.0`
|"string"| `null`
|null    | `null`
|===

We can use this function to check which properties are numbers, and since Cypher does not support setting dynamic node properties, use the `apoc.create.setProperty` feature to update the property.

.Set Properties
[source,cypher]
----
:auto // Run in an implicit transaction within Neo4j Browser
include::solution.cypher[tag=set]
----

1. Find all nodes with a `:Person` label
2. Split the `(:Person)` nodes into batches of 100
3. Use the `keys()` function to get all property keys for the node and process one per line
4. Access the property value using square brackets `toFloat()` to attempt to convert it to a float
5. Use `apoc.create.setProperty()` to set the new value

.Set Properties Result
[Attributes]
|===
| `result`
|"done"
|===

== Summary
In this lesson you imported the data into your Neo4j Sandbox instance and converted all numerical properties to float using the `toFloat()` function and `apoc.create.setProperty()` procedure.

In the next module we will explore the survey dataset.
