This course uses the link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey[Young People Survey^] dataset available on Kaggle.

In 2013, students of the Statistics class at link:https://fses.uniba.sk/en/[FSEV UK^] invited their friends to participate in a survey.
The survey was presented in electronic and written form, and participants were of Slovakian nationality between the ages of 15 and 30.
The survey was designed to collect information on various aspects of the participants' lives, including their music and movie preferences, hobbies, phobias, health habits, personality traits, views on life, opinions, spending habits, and demographics.

The students received 1010 responses to 150 questions, 139 of which are integer values and 11 are categorical.
The data can be split into the following groups:

A CSV file containing the responses is link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasonjo/blog-datasets/main/survey/responses.csv[available on Github^].


In the subsequent modules, you will learn how to encode categorical variables and perform dimensionality reduction, like eliminating low variance and highly correlating features.
After the preprocessing step, you will learn how to perform community detection using the KMeans algorithm.

You will also learn how to perform community detection of people based on their responses by constructing a nearest-neighbor graph and using the Leiden algorithm to identify groups of similar people.
