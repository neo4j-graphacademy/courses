== Introduction

[.col]
====
You can use the `execute_query()` method to run one-off Cypher statements or statements that return a small number of records.
This method fetches a list of records and loads them into memory.


[source,python]
----
cypher = """
MATCH (p:Person {name: $name})-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) 
RETURN m.title AS title, r.role AS role
"""
name="Tom Hanks"

records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query( # <1>
    cypher,    # <2>
    name=name  # <3>
)
----
====

[.col]
====

<1> The method returns a tuple that can be unpacked to access the query result, summary, and keys.
<2> The method expects a Cypher statement as a string as the first argument.
<3> Any named parameters not suffixed with an underscore can be accessed in the query by prefixing the name with a dollar sign.

[TIP]
.Using Parameters
=====
It is good practice to use parameters in your queries to avoid malicious code being injected into your Cypher statement.

== Handling the Result

The `execute_query()` method returns an a tuple containing three objects:  

1. A list of `Record` objects
2. A summary of the query execution
3. A list of keys specified in the `RETURN` clause

[source,python]
----
print(keys) # ['title', 'role']
print(summary) # A summary of the query execution
----

[.slide]
== Accessing results

Each row returned by the query is a `Record` object.  The `Record` object is a dictionary-like object that provides access to the data returned by the query.

You can access any item in the `RETURN` clause using square brackets.

[source,python]
----
# RETURN m.title AS title, r.role AS role

for record in records:
    print(record["title"]) # Toy Story
    print(record["role"]) # "Woody"
----

[.slide]
== Transforming results

The `execute_query()` method accepts a `result_transformer_` argument that allows you to transform the result into an alternative format.

Rather than returning the tuple, the query will return the output of the `result_transformer_` function.

[source,python]
----
result = driver.execute_query(
    cypher,
    name=name,
    result_transformer_= lambda result: [
        f"Tom Hanks played {record['role']} in {record['title']}" 
        for record in result
    ]
)

print(result) # [Tom Hanks played Woody in Toy Story, ...]
----


[.slide]
== Working with DataFrames

The `Result` class provides a `to_df()` method that can be used to transform the result into a pandas `DataFrame`.

[source,python]
----
from neo4j import Result

driver.execute_query(
  cypher, 
  result_transformer_=Result.to_df
)
----

[.slide]
== Reading and writing 

By default, `execute_query()` runs in **WRITE** mode.  In a clustered environment, this sends all queries to the cluster leader, putting unnecessary load on the leader. 

When you're only reading data, you can optimize performance by setting the `routing_` parameter to READ mode. 
This distributes your read queries across all cluster members.

[source,python]
----
from neo4j import Result, RoutingControl 

driver.execute_query(
  cypher, 
  result_transformer_=Result.to_df,
  routing_=RoutingControl.READ # or simply "r"
)
----

[TIP]
You can also pass `r` for read mode and `w` for write mode.
