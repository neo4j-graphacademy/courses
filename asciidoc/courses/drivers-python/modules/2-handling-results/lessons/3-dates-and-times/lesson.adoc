== Temporal types

The `neo4j.time` module provides classes for working with dates and times in Python. 

Temporal types in Neo4j are a combination of date, time and timezone elements.

.Temporal Types
[cols="2,3,1,1,1"]
|===
|Type |Description |Date? |Time? |Timezone?

|`Date` |A tuple of Year, Month and Day |Y | |
|`Time` |A point in time |Y |Y |
|`LocalTime` |A time without a timezone | |Y |
|`DateTime` |A combination of Date and Time |Y |Y |Y
|`LocalDateTime` |A combination of Date and Time without a timezone |Y |Y |

== Writing temporal types

[.col]
====

[source,python]
----
from neo4j.time import DateTime
from datetime import timezone, timedelta

driver.execute_query("""
CREATE (e:Event {
  startsAt: $datetime,              // <1>
  createdAt: datetime($dtstring),   // <2>
  updatedAt: datetime()             // <3>
})
""", 
  datetime=DateTime(
    2024, 5, 15, 14, 30, 0, 
    tzinfo=timezone(timedelta(hours=2))
  ),  # <4>
  dtstring="2024-05-15T14:30:00+02:00"
)
----
====

[.col]
====
When you write temporal types to the database, you can pass the object as a parameter to the query or cast the value within a Cypher statement. 

This example demonstrates how to:

<1> Use a `DateTime` object as a parameter to the query (`<4>`)
<2> Cast an link:https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html[ISO 8601 format string^] within a Cypher statement
<3> Get the current date and time using the `datetime()` function.

== Reading temporal types

[.col]
====
When reading temporal types from the database, you will receive an instance of the corresponding Python type unless you cast the value within your query.
====

[.col]
====
[source,python]
----
# Query returning temporal types
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query("""
RETURN date() as date, time() as time, datetime() as datetime, toString(datetime()) as asString
""")

# Access the first record
for record in records:
    # Automatic conversion to Python driver types
    date = record["date"]         # neo4j.time.Date
    time = record["time"]         # neo4j.time.Time
    datetime = record["datetime"] # neo4j.time.DateTime
    asString = record["asString"] # str

[.slide.col-2]
== Working with Durations


[.col]
====

[source,python]
----
from neo4j.time import Duration, DateTime

startsAt = DateTime.now() 
eventLength = Duration(hours=1, minutes=30)
endsAt = startsAt + eventLength 

driver.execute_query("""
CREATE (e:Event {
  startsAt: $startsAt, endsAt: $endsAt,
  duration: $eventLength, // <1>
  interval: duration('P30M') // <2>
})
""",
  startsAt=startsAt, endsAt=endsAt, eventLength=eventLength
)
----

====

[.col]
====
Durations represent a period of time and can be used for date arithmetic in both Python and Cypher.  These types can also be created in Python or cast within a Cypher statement.

<1> Pass an instance of `Duration` to the query
<2> Use the `duration()` function to create a `Duration` object from an ISO 8601 format string

[TIP]
.Calculating durations
=====
You can use the `duration.between` method to calculate the duration between two date or time objects.

[.summary]
== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about working with temporal types in Neo4j using the Python driver:

* The `neo4j.time` module provides classes for handling dates, times, and durations
* You can pass temporal objects as parameters or create them within Cypher statements
* When reading temporal values from Neo4j, they are automatically converted to the appropriate Python driver types
* Durations can be used for date arithmetic in both Python and Cypher

[TIP]
.Converting between driver and standard library types
====
The Neo4j Python driver's temporal types (like `DateTime`) are different from Python's standard library types (like `datetime.datetime`). If you need to convert between them:

* To convert from driver types to standard library: use the `.to_native()` method
* To convert from standard library to driver types: use the class constructor or `.from_native()` method
