== Introduction

[.col]
====
Let's take a look at the types of data returned by a Cypher query.

The majority of the types returned by a Cypher query are mapped directly to Python types, but some more complex types need special handling.

* Graph types - Nodes, Relationships and Paths
* Temporal types - Dates and times
* Spatial types - Points and distances

[TIP]
.Types in Neo4j Browser
=====
When graph types are returned by a query, they are visualized in a graph layout.

| `Integer`

| `float`
| `Float`

| `str`
| `String`

| `bytearray`
| `Bytes [1]`

| `list`
| `List`

| `dict`
| `Map`

[.slide]
== Graph types

The following code snippet finds all movies with the specified title and returns `person`, `acted_in` and `movie`.

.Return Nodes and Relationships
[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query("""
MATCH path = (person:Person)-[actedIn:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie {title: $title})
RETURN path, person, actedIn, movie
""", title=movie)
----


[.slide.col-2]
== Nodes

[.col]
====

Nodes are returned as a `Node` object.


[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
for record in records:
    node = record["movie"]
----

.Working with Node Objects
[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
    print(node.element_id)      # (1)
    print(node.labels)          # (2)
    print(node.items())         # (3)

    # (4)
    print(node["name"])
    print(node.get("name", "N/A"))
----

====

[.col]
====
1. The `element_id` property provides access to the node's element ID +
    eg. `4:97b72e9c-ae4d-427c-96ff-8858ecf16f88:0` 
2. The `labels` property is a frozenset containing an array of labels attributed to the Node +
    eg. `['Person', 'Actor']`
3. The `items()` method provides access to the node's properties as an iterable of all name-value pairs. +
    eg. `{name: 'Tom Hanks', tmdbId: '31'}`
4. A single property can be retrieved by either using `[]` brackets or using the `get()` method.  The `get()` method also allows you to define a default property if none exists.

[.slide.col-2]
== Relationships

[.col]
====

Relationships are returned as a `Relationship` object.

[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
    acted_in = record["actedIn"]

    print(acted_in.id)         # (1)
    print(acted_in.type)       # (2)
    print(acted_in.items())    # (3)

    # 4
    print(acted_in["roles"])
    print(acted_in.get("roles", "(Unknown)"))

    print(acted_in.start_node) # (5)
    print(acted_in.end_node)   # (6)
----

====

[.col]
====
1. `id` - Internal ID of the relationship (eg. `9876`)
2. `type` - Type of relationship (eg. `ACTED_IN`) 
3. `items()` - Returns relationship properties as name-value pairs (eg. `{role: 'Woody'}`)
4. Access properties using brackets `[]` or `get()` method
5. `start_node` - `Node` object at the start of the relationship
6. `end_node` - `Node` object at the end of the relationship
====

[.slide.col-2]
== Paths

[.col]
====

A path is a sequence of nodes and relationships and is returned as a `Path` object.


[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
    path = record["path"]

    print(path.start_node)  # (1)
    print(path.end_node)    # (2)
    print(len(path))  # (1)
    print(path.relationships)  # (1)
----

====

[.col]
====
1. `start_node` - `Node` object at the start of the path
2. `end_node` - `Node` object at the end of the path
3. `len(path)` - The number of relationships within the path
4. `relationships` - An tuple of `Relationship` objects within the path.

[TIP]
.Paths are iterable
======
Use `iter(path)` to iterate over the relationships in a path.
