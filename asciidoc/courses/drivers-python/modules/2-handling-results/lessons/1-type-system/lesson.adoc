== Introduction

[.col]
====
Let's take a look at the types of data returned by a Cypher query.

The majority of the types returned by a Cypher query are mapped directly to Python types, but some more complex types need special handling.

* Graph types - Nodes, Relationships and Paths
* Temporal types - Dates and times
* Spatial types - Points and distances

[TIP]
.Types in Neo4j Browser
=====
When graph types are returned by a query, they are visualized in a graph layout.

| `bool`
| `Boolean`

| `int`
| `Integer`

| `float`
| `Float`

| `str`
| `String`

| `bytearray`

| `list`
| `List`

| `dict`

== Graph types

The following code snippet finds all movies with the specified title and returns `person`, `acted_in` and `movie`.

.Return Nodes and Relationships
[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.py[tag=run]

[.slide.col-2]
== Nodes

[.col]
====

Nodes are returned as a `Node` object.


[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.py[tag=node]
----

.Working with Node Objects
[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.py[tag=node_info]
----

====

[.col]
====
1. The `element_id` property provides access to the node's element ID +
    eg. `4:97b72e9c-ae4d-427c-96ff-8858ecf16f88:0` 
2. The `labels` property is a frozenset containing an array of labels attributed to the Node +
    eg. `['Person', 'Actor']`
3. The `items()` method provides access to the node's properties as an iterable of all name-value pairs. +
    eg. `{name: 'Tom Hanks', tmdbId: '31' }`
4. A single property can be retrieved by either using `[]` brackets or using the `get()` method.  The `get()` method also allows you to define a default property if none exists.

[.slide.col-2]
== Relationships

[.col]
====

Relationships are returned as a `Relationship` object.

[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.py[tag=rel]
----

====

[.col]
====
1. `id` - Internal ID of the relationship (eg. `9876`)
2. `type` - Type of relationship (eg. `ACTED_IN`) 
3. `items()` - Returns relationship properties as name-value pairs (eg. `{role: 'Woody'}`)
4. Access properties using brackets `[]` or `get()` method
5. `start_node` - ID of the starting node
6. `end_node` - ID of the ending node
====

[.slide.col-2]
== Paths

[.col]
====

A path is a sequence of nodes and relationships and is returned as a `Path` object.


[source,python,role=ncopy,subs="attributes+",indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/results.py[tag=path]
----

====

[.col]
====
1. `start_node` - a Neo4j `Integer` representing the internal ID for the node at the start of the path
2.  `end_node` - a Neo4j `Integer` representing the internal ID for the node at the end of the path
3. `len(path)` - A count of the number of relationships within the path
4. `relationships` - An array of `Relationship` objects within the path.

[TIP]
.Paths are iterable
======
Use `iter(path)` to iterate over the relationships in a path.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the types of data returned by a Cypher query and how to work with them in your application.

Now it's time to test yourself on what you've learned.
