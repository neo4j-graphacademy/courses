= Spatial types 
:type: quiz
:order: 5



Cypher has built-in support for handling spatial values (points), and the underlying database supports storing these point values as properties on nodes and relationships.

== Points

|===
| Cypher Type | Python Type

| Point | `neo4j.spatial.Point`

| Point (Cartesian) | `neo4j.spatial.CartesianPoint`

| Point (WGS-84) | `neo4j.spatial.WGS84Point`
|===


=== CartesianPoint

A Cartesian Point can be created in Cypher by supplying `x` and `y` values to the `point()` function.
The optional `z` value represents the height.

To create a Cartesian Point in Python, you can import the `neo4j.spatial.CartesianPoint` class.

.Cartesian
[source,python]
----
# Using X and Y values
twoD=CartesianPoint((1.23, 4.56))
print(twoD.x, twoD.y)

# Using X, Y and Z
threeD=CartesianPoint((1.23, 4.56, 7.89))
print(threeD.x, threeD.y, threeD.z)

=== WGS84Point

A WGS84 Point can be created in Cypher by supplying `latitude` and `longitude` values to the `point()` function.
To create a Cartesian Point in Python, you can import the `neo4j.spatial.WGS84Point` class.

.WGS84
[source,python]
----
london=WGS84Point((-0.118092, 51.509865))
print(london.longitude, london.latitude)

the_shard=WGS84Point((-0.086500, 51.504501, 310))
print(the_shard.longitude, the_shard.latitude, the_shard.height)
----

== Distance

When using the `point.distance` function in Cypher, the distance calculated between two points is returned as a float.


[source,cypher]
----
WITH point({x: 1, y:1}) AS one,
     point({x: 10, y: 10}) AS two

RETURN point.distance(one, two) // 12.727922061357855
