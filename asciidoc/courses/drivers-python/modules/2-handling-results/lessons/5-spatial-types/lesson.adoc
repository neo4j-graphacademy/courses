[.slide.discrete]
== Points and locations


[.col]
====
Neo4j has built-in support for two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial data types.
These are referred to as **points**.
A point may represent geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude) or Cartesian coordinates (x, y). 

Depending on the values used to create the point, it can either be a `CartesianPoint` or a `WGS84Point`.  If you specify three values, these are considered three dimensional points.  Otherwise, they are considered two dimensional points.

In Python, these values are represented by the `neo4j.spatial.CartesianPoint` and `neo4j.spatial.WGS84Point` classes, which are subclasses of the `neo4j.spatial.Point` class.

|===
| Cypher Type | Python Type | SRID | 3D SRID

| Point (Cartesian) | `neo4j.spatial.CartesianPoint` | `7203` | `9157`

| Point (WGS-84) | `neo4j.spatial.WGS84Point` | `4326` | `4979`

[.slide.col-2]
== CartesianPoint

[.col]
====
A Cartesian Point defines a point with x and y coordinates.
An additional z value can be provided to define a three-dimensional point.

You can create a cartesian point by passing a tuple of values to the `CartesianPoint` constructor or by passing `x`, `y` and `z` values to the point function in Cypher.

.CartesianPoint
[source,python]
----
from neo4j.spatial import CartesianPoint

two_d = CartesianPoint((x, y))
three_d = CartesianPoint((x, y, z))
----

The driver will convert `point` data types created with an x, y and z value to an instance of the `CartesianPoint` class.
====

[.col]
====


[source,python]
----
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query("""
RETURN point({x: 1.23, y: 4.56, z: 7.89}) AS threeD
""")

point = records[0]["threeD"]

# <1> Accessing attributes
print(point.x, point.y, point.z, point.srid) # 1.23, 4.56, 7.89, 9157

# <2> Destructuring
x, y, z = point
----

The values can be accessed using the `x`, `y` and `z` attributes `<1>` or by destructuring the point `<2>`.

====

[.slide.col-2]
== WGS84Point

[.col]
====
A WSG  _(World Geodetic System)_ point consists of a `latitude` and `longitude` value.
An additional `height` value can be provided to define a three-dimensional point and can be created by passing a tuple of values to the `WGS84Point` constructor or by passing `longitude`, `latitude` and `height` values to the point function in Cypher.

.WGS84Point
[source,python]
----
from neo4j.spatial import WGS84Point

ldn = WGS84Point((-0.118092, 51.509865))
print(ldn.longitude, ldn.latitude, ldn.srid) # -0.118092, 51.509865, 4326

shard = WGS84Point((-0.086500, 51.504501, 310))
print(shard.longitude, shard.latitude, shard.height, shard.srid) # -0.0865, 51.504501, 310, 4979

# Using destructuring
longitude, latitude, height = shard
----


====

[.col]
====
The driver will return `WGS84Point` objects when `point` data types are created with `latitude` and `longitude` values in Cypher.  The values can be accessed using the `longitude`, `latitude` and `height` attributes or by destructuring the point.

.Using point()
[source,python]
----
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query("""
RETURN point({
    latitude: 51.5,
    longitude: -0.118,
    height: 100
}) AS point
""")

point = records[0]["point"]
longitude, latitude, height = point
----

[.slide.col-2]
== Distance

[.col]
====
The `point.distance` function can be used to calculate the distance between two points with the same SRID.
The result is a `float` representing the distance in a straight line between the two points.

[WARNING]
.SRIDs must be compatible
=====
If the SRID values are different, the function will return `None`.
=====

====

[.col]
====
[source,python]
----
# Create two points
point1 = CartesianPoint((1, 1))
point2 = CartesianPoint((10, 10))

# Query the distance using Cypher
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query("""
RETURN point.distance($p1, $p2) AS distance
""", p1=point1, p2=point2)

# Print the distance from the result
distance = records[0]["distance"]
print(distance)  # 12.727922061357855

[.summary]
== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the `CartesianPoint` and `WGS84Point` classes and how to use them in Python.

Regardless of the type of point, you can always access the individual components by destructuring the point object.
