== Error Handling

When working with Neo4j, you may encounter various database errors that need to be handled gracefully in your application. 
The driver exports a `Neo4jError` class that is inherited by all exceptions thrown by the database.
Exceptions related to the driver and its connection are subclasses of `DriverError`.


=== Common exceptions 

* `CypherSyntaxError` - Raised when the Cypher syntax is invalid
* `ConstraintError` - Raised when a constraint unique or other is violated
* `AuthError` - Raised when authentication fails
* `TransientError` - Raised when the database is not accessible
// * `ForbiddenError` - Raised when the client is not authorized to perform the operation
// * `DatabaseError` - Base class for all database-related errors
// * `ServiceUnavailable` - Raised when the database is not accessible
// * `ClientError` - Base class for all client-side errors

== Handling errors

Any errors raised by the DBMS (`Neo4jError`) will have `code` and `message` properties that describe the error.

[source,python]
----
from neo4j.exceptions import Neo4jError

try:
    # Run a Cypher statement
except Neo4jError as e:
    print(e.code)
    print(e.message)
    print(e.gql_status)
    


----

The `gql_status` property contains an error code that corresponds to an error in the ISO GQL standard.  

A full list of error codes can be found in link:https://neo4j.com/docs/status-codes/current/errors/gql-errors/[Status Codes for Errors & Notifications^].


[.slide.col-2]
== Example: Handling unique constraint violations

[.col]
====
One common scenario is dealing with constraint violations when inserting data.
A unique constraint ensures that a property value is unique across all nodes with a specific label. 

The following Cypher statement creates a unique constraint named `unique_email` to ensure that the `email` property is unique for the `User` label:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT unique_email IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (u:User) REQUIRE u.email IS UNIQUE
----

If a Cypher statement violates this constraint, Neo4j will raise a `ConstraintError`.

[.transcript-only]
=====
Here's an example of how to handle a unique constraint violation when creating a new user:
=====

[source,python]
----
from neo4j.exceptions import ConstraintError

def create_user(tx, name, email):
    try:
        result = tx.run("""
            CREATE (u:User {name: $name, email: $email})
            RETURN u
        """, name=name, email=email)

    except ConstraintError as e:
        print(e.code)  
        # Neo.ClientError.Schema.ConstraintValidationFailed
        print(e.message) 
        # The value [email] for property [email] violates the constraint [unique_email]
        print(e.gql_status) # 22N41

[.summary]
== Summary

Proper error handling is crucial for building robust Neo4j applications. By catching and handling specific exceptions:

* Your application can gracefully handle expected error conditions
* Users receive meaningful feedback
* You can implement appropriate recovery strategies
* Your application remains stable even when errors occur

[TIP]
.Best Practices
====
* Always catch specific exceptions rather than using a bare `except`
* Log errors appropriately for debugging
* Provide meaningful feedback to users
* Consider implementing retry logic for transient errors
====

You can link:https://neo4j.com/docs/status-codes/current/errors/[find a full list of driver exceptions in the Neo4j Python Driver Manual^].

In the next challenge, you will use this information to handle errors in a real-world scenario.
