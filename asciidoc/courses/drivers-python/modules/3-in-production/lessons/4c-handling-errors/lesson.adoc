= Handling errors
:type: quiz
:minutes: 10
:order: 4

Let's practice error handling in a real-world scenario.

You have built an application that includes a registration form for new users.
As part of the setup, you have added a unique constraint on the `email` property for the `User` label. 

[source,cypher]
.Creating a unique constraint
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT unique_email IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (u:User) REQUIRE u.email IS UNIQUE
----

Your application includes a function called `create_user` that creates a new user in the database.
It does not check for existing users with the same email address, and instead relies on the database to enforce the constraint.

== Lesson Summary

In this challenge you demonstrated how to handle errors in a real-world scenario. 

You should now have all of the information needed to build a Python application that connect to Neo4j and the confidence put it into production.
