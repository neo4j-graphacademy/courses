from neo4j.exceptions import ConstraintError

def add_user(tx, name, email):
    try:
        result = tx.run(
            "CREATE (u:User {name: $name, email: $email}) RETURN u",
            name=name, email=email
        )
        return {"success": True, "message": "User created successfully"}
    #select:except ConstraintError as e:
        return {"success": False, "message": f"Email {email} already exists"}

- [x] except ConstraintError as e
- [ ] except UserExistsError as e
- [ ] except ProgrammingError as e
- [ ] except PEBKACError as e

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The Cypher statement above creates a __constraint__ on the `email` property for the `User` label.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is `except ConstraintError as e`.

The `except ConstraintError as e` block will catch the constraint error and return a message to the user.

The other options are incorrect because:

- `run()` is deprecated and should not be used
- `execute_write()` is for write transactions only
- `run_async()` is not a valid method for the session object
