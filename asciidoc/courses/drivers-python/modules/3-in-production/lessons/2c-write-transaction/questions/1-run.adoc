.Hint
====
When reading data from Neo4j, use `execute_read()` to run a read transaction. This ensures that the transaction is properly managed and allows for streaming results back to the client.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is `execute_read()`.

`execute_read()` is the recommended method for running read transactions in Neo4j. 
The function handles transaction management automatically and allows for streaming results as they become available.

The other options are incorrect because:

- `run()` is deprecated and should not be used
- `execute_write()` is for write transactions only
- `run_async()` is not a valid method for the session object
