== What is Neo4j?

image::images/01neo4j-architecture-diagram.svg[Components of the Neo4j Graph Data Platform,width=500,align=center]

Neo4j is a native graph database with many features and functionality making up the Neo4j Graph Platform. Specifically:

* The Neo4j DBMS
* The property graph data model
* The Cypher statement language
* Language drivers using the Bolt protocol for building applications
* Graph analytics with Graph Data Science
* Data visualization with Neo4j Bloom
* Neo4j Aura database-as-a-service
* A GraphQL integration for building GraphQL APIs backed by Neo4j

TODO - course pre-requisites - this seems light?  This course may be completed even if you don't have much Neo4j experience, however we suggest reviewing the https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-platform/[Neo4j Developer Guides^] for a better understanding of some of the features of the Neo4j graph database.

== What is GraphQL?

image::images/01graphqloverview.png[GraphQL Overview showing an example of describing, request and receiving data ,width=500,align=center]

GraphQL is an API query language and runtime for fulfilling those queries. 

GraphQL uses a type system to define the data available in the API, including what entities and attributes (*types* and *fields* in GraphQL parlance) exist and how types are connected (the data graph). 

[source,GraphQL]
----
type Course {
  title: String
  author: String
  credits: Int
}
----

GraphQL operations (queries, mutations, or subscriptions) specify an entry-point and a traversal of the data graph.
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  Course {
    title
    author
  }
}
----

The operation also defines what fields will be returned by the operation. 

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "Course": [
      { 
        "title": "Introduction to Neo4J & GraphQL", 
        "author": "neo4j" 
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

=== GraphQL Concepts

It is important to have an understanding of the key GraphQL concepts of:

* Type Definitions
* Operations
* Selection set
* Resolver functions

\... before exploring GraphQL's use with Neo4j. 

For more information see the https://graphql.org/[official GraphQL site^].

==== GraphQL Type Definitions

GraphQL type definitions define the data available in the API. These type definitions are typically defined using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), a language-agnostic way of expressing the types.

[source,GraphQL]
----
type Course {
  title: String
  author: String
  credits: Int
  lessons: [Lesson]
}

type Lesson {
  title: String
  content: String
  optional: Boolean
}
----

> Type definitions can be also be defined programmatically, which is useful when TODO ... 

// image::images/01typedefs.png[GraphQL type definitions, width=500,align=center]

==== GraphQL Operations

Each GraphQL operation is either a Query, Mutation, or Subscription. 

The following query will return course and lesson data as described by the type definitions:

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  Course(title: "Introduction to Neo4J & GraphQL") {
    title
    lessons() {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
----

The fields of the Query, Mutation, and Subscription types define the entry point for an operation e.g.

[source,GraphQL]
----
Course(title: "Introduction to Neo4J & GraphQL")
----

Each operation starts at the field of one of these types. TODO - what does this mean?

// image::images/01operation.png[GraphQL operations,width=500, align=center]

==== The Selection Set

The selection set specifies the fields to be returned by a GraphQL operation.

The selection set of the previous query would return the `Course` `title` and the `title` and `content` for each `Lesson`.

The query could be modified to return the `Course` `author` and `credits` by adding them to the selection set:

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  Course(title: "Introduction to Neo4J & GraphQL") {
    title
    author
    credits
    lessons() {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
----

The selection set and can be thought of as a traversal through the data graph.

// image::images/01selectionset.png[GraphQL selection set,width=500, align=center]

The response to a GraphQL operation will match the shape of the selection set, returning on the data requested.

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "Course": [
      {
        "title": "Introduction to Neo4J & GraphQL",
        "author": "neo4j",
        "credits": 25,
        "lessons": [
          {
            "title": "Introduction To GraphQL",
            "content": "GraphQL is an API query language ..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

// image::images/01result.png[GraphQL result, width=500, align=center]

==== Resolver Functions

GraphQL resolvers are the functions responsible for actually fulfilling the GraphQL operation. In the context of a query, this means fetching data from a data layer.

[source,javascript]
----
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    Course: (object, params, context, info) => {
      return context.db.coursesBySearch(params.searchString)
    }
  },
  Course: {
    lesson: (object, params, context, info) => {
      return context.db.lessonForCourse(object.courseId)
    }
  }
}
----

=== Benefits of GraphQL

Some of the benefits of GraphQL include:

* **Overfetching** - sending less data over the wire
* **Underfetching** - everything the client needs in a single request
* The **GraphQL specification** defines exactly what GraphQL is
* **Simplify data fetching** with component-based data interactions
* **"Graphs all the way down"** - GraphQL can help unify disparate systems and focus API interactions on relationships instead of resources.
* **Developer productivity** - By reasoning about application data as a graph with a strict type system, developers can focus on building applications.

=== GraphQL Challenges

Of course GraphQL is not perfect. It's important to be aware of some of the challenges that come from introducing GraphQL in a system.

* Some well understood practices from REST don't apply:
    ** HTTP status codes
    ** Error handling
    ** Caching
* Exposing arbitrary complexity to the client and performance considerations
* The n+1 query problem - the nested nature of GraphQL operations can lead to multiple requests to the data layer(s) to resolve a request
* Query costing and rate limiting

Best practices and tooling have emerged to address these challenges, however it's important to be aware of them.
