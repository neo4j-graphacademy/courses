= The Neo4j GraphQL Library
:order: 3

The toolbox provides an easy-to-use interface over the https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/[Neo4j GraphQL Library ^].

The fundamental goal of the Neo4j GraphQL Library is to make it easier to build GraphQL APIs backed by Neo4j.

[TIP]
.Graphs and GraphQL
====
It's important to note that GraphQL is an API query language and NOT a database query language. The Neo4j GraphQL Library helps you build an API layer that sits between the client and database, not to execute GraphQL queries directly against the database.
====

The Neo4j GraphQL Library focuses on the following high-level objectives:

* Reducing boilerplate
* Developer productivity
* Extensibility
* Performance

== Goals of the Neo4j GraphQL Library

=== GraphQL First Development

GraphQL type definitions can drive the database data model, meaning you don't need to maintain two separate schemas for your API and database.

=== Auto-generate GraphQL API Operations

With the Neo4j GraphQL Library, GraphQL type definitions provide the starting point for a generated API that includes:

* Query & Mutation types (an API entry-point for each type defined in the schema)
* Ordering
* Pagination
* Complex filtering
* DateTime & Spatial types and filtering

// Query for image

// {
//   movies(where: {title_CONTAINS: "Matrix"}) {
//     title
//     year
//     genres(options: {limit: 2}) {
//       name
//     }
//     recommended {
//       title
//     }
//     actors {
//       name
//     }
//   }
// }

=== Generate Cypher From GraphQL Operations

The Neo4j GraphQL Library automatically generates a single database query for any arbitrary GraphQL request. 

Single automatically generated queries: 

* remove the need to implement resolvers
* reduce boilerplate code
* optimize the performance of queries
* GraphQL operations require only a single roundtrip to the database

=== Extend GraphQL With Cypher

To add custom logic beyond CRUD operations, you can use the https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/type-definitions/cypher/[`@cypher` GraphQL schema directive] to add computed fields bound to a Cypher statement to the GraphQL schema.
