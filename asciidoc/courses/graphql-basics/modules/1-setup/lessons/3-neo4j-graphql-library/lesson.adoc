= The Neo4j GraphQL Library
:order: 3

The toolbox provides an easy to use interface over the https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/[Neo4j GraphQL Library ^].

The fundamental goal of the Neo4j GraphQL Library is to make it easier to build GraphQL APIs backed by Neo4j.

> It's important to point out that GraphQL is an API query language and NOT a database query language. The Neo4j GraphQL Library helps you build an API layer that sits between the client and database, not to execute GraphQL queries directly against the database.

At a high level, the objectives of the Neo4j GraphQL Library are focused on:

* Reducing boilerplate
* Developer productivity
* Extensibility
* Performance

== Goals of the Neo4j GraphQL Library

=== GraphQL First Development

GraphQL type definitions can drive the database data model, this means you don't need to maintain two separate schemas for your API and database.

=== Auto-generate GraphQL API Operations

With the Neo4j GraphQL Library, GraphQL type definitions provide the starting point for a generated API that includes:

* Query & Mutation types (an API entrypoint for each type defined in the schema)
* Ordering
* Pagination
* Complex filtering
* DateTime & Spatial types and filtering

// Query for image

// {
//   movies(where: {title_CONTAINS: "Matrix"}) {
//     title
//     year
//     genres(options: {limit: 2}) {
//       name
//     }
//     recommended {
//       title
//     }
//     actors {
//       name
//     }
//   }
// }

=== Generate Cypher From GraphQL Operations

To reduce boilerplate and optimize for performance the Neo4j GraphQL Library automatically generates a single database query for any arbitrary GraphQL request. This means the developer does not need to implement resolvers and each GraphQL operation results in a single roundtrip to the database.

=== Extend GraphQL With Cypher

To add custom logic beyond CRUD operations, you can use the https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/type-definitions/cypher/[`@cypher` GraphQL schema directive] to add computed fields bound to a Cypher statement to the GraphQL schema.
