= Custom Logic
:order: 4

== Lesson Overview

In this module we'll see how to add custom logic to our GraphQL using Cypher, specifically by using the `@cypher` GraphQL schema directive. We'll also take a look a few use cases where we might be tempted to use the `@cypher` schema directive, but instead can leverage features of the Neo4j GraphQL Library such as using full text indexes.
