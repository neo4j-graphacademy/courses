== Lesson Overview

In this module we will explore some of the more advanced features of GraphQL and the Neo4j GraphQL library. We take a look at GraphQL's abstract types: interfaces and unions and how to use them with the Neo4j GraphQL Library. We also see how to work with relationship properties in the Neo4j GraphQL Library as well as point and distance filtering, dates, and aggregations.
