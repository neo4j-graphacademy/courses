You will add custom logic to GraphQL using Cypher, specifically by using the `@cypher` GraphQL schema directive.

Then you will take a look at some use cases where you can leverage features of the Neo4j GraphQL Library such as full-text search.

Finally you will learn about some of the other GraphQL schema directives that can be used with the Neo4j GraphQL Library for controlling and configuring the GraphQL schema.
