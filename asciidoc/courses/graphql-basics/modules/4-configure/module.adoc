= Configure The API
:order: 4

== Lesson Overview

In this module we will see how to configure the generated GraphQL API using GraphQL schema directives.

First we will add custom logic to our GraphQL using Cypher, specifically by using the `@cypher` GraphQL schema directive. 

Then we'll take a look at a few use cases where we might be tempted to use the `@cypher` schema directive, but instead can leverage features of the Neo4j GraphQL Library such as full-text search.

Finally we touch on some of the other GraphQL schema directives that can be used with the Neo4j GraphQL Library for controlling and configuring the GraphQL schema.
