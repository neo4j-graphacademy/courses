== Module Overview

In this module you will explore how to configure the generated GraphQL API using GraphQL schema directives.

You will add custom logic to GraphQL using Cypher, specifically by using the `@cypher` GraphQL schema directive.

Then you will take a look at some use cases where you can leverage features of the Neo4j GraphQL Library such as full-text search.

Finally you will learn about some of the other GraphQL schema directives that can be used with the Neo4j GraphQL Library for controlling and configuring the GraphQL schema.
