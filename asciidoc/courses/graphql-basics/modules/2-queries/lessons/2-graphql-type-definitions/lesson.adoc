= GraphQL Type Definitions 
:order: 2

The Neo4j GraphQL library maps GraphQL type definitions to the equivalent property graph data model in Neo4j to generate a single Cypher query to resolve an arbitrary GraphQL request.

In this lesson, you will learn how to update the GraphQL type definitions to: 

* Add additional fields to the existing GraphQL `Movie` type
* Create new GraphQL types for other nodes 
* Create relationships between the types

== GraphQL Type Definitions And The Property Graph Model

You have used this simple GraphQL type definitions with the movie recommendations dataset:

[source,GraphQL]
----
type Movie {
  title: String
}
----

There is a much richer dataset in your Neo4j sandbox database:

Let's see how to update the GraphQL type definitions to match this property graph data model.

== Adding Fields

First, add fields to the `Movie` type in the GraphQL type definitions to make additional node properties available in the GraphQL API.

Return to the "Type definitions" editor in the Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox to update the type definitions that define the GraphQL API.

. Replace the contents of the type definition editor with the following GraphQL type definitions to add additional fields to the `Movie` type:
+
[source,GraphQL]
----
type Movie {
  title: String!
  year: Int
  plot: String
  imdbRating: Float
  countries: [String]
  languages: [String]
  poster: String
  revenue: Int
  budget: Int
}
----
[NOTE]
The `!` after the `title` field type indicates that this field is required and cannot be null (i.e. it is non-nullable).
. Click the "Build schema" button to update the generated GraphQL API to use these updated type definitions.
+ 
Building the schema adds the fields to the GraphQL API. You can now use these new fields in your GraphQL queries. 
. Run the following query to see the result. 
+
[source,GraphQL]
----
query MyQuery {
  movies(options: { limit: 10 }) {
    title
    year
    poster
    plot
    countries
    languages
    budget
    revenue
  }
}
----
[TIP]
You can also create queries by selecting the fields using the checkboxes in the Explorer pane.

== Adding Nodes

The Neo4j GraphQL Library maps GraphQL types to node labels in Neo4j - you can include additional nodes in the GraphQL API by adding them to the type definition.

. Modify the type definitions to include the `User`, `Actor` and `Genre` types as follows:
+
[source,GraphQL]
----
type Movie {
  title: String!
  year: Int
  plot: String
  imdbRating: Float
  countries: [String]
  languages: [String]
  poster: String
  revenue: Int
  budget: Int
}

type User {
  userId: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Actor {
  name: String!
}

type Genre {
  name: String!
}
----
. Build the schema to update the generated GraphQL API.
 
After doing this and returning to the Query Editor tab in GraphQL Toolbox you'll notice there are now more top-level Query fields for the additional types in the Explorer. 

image::images/02additionalquerytypes-annotated.png[New query types in the Query Editor Explorer,width=500,align=center]

By default, each type defined in our GraphQL type definitions will result in these top-level Query fields added to the schema.  

You can now use these new types in your GraphQL queries e.g. this query will return the name of all the movie genres.

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  genres {
    name
  }
}
----


[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "genres": [
      { "name": "Adventure" },
      { "name": "Animation" },
      { "name": "Children" },
      { "name": "Comedy" },
      { "name": "Fantasy" },
      { "name": "Romance" },
      { "name": "Drama" },
      { "name": "Action" },
      { "name": "Crime" },
      { "name": "Thriller" },
      { "name": "Horror" },
      { "name": "Mystery" },
      { "name": "Sci-Fi" },
      { "name": "Documentary" },
      { "name": "IMAX" },
      { "name": "War" },
      { "name": "Musical" },
      { "name": "Western" },
      { "name": "Film-Noir" },
      { "name": "(no genres listed)" }
    ]
  }
}

----


But there is a problem - the nodes are not connected in the GraphQL API! You can't see what movies are in which genre or what genre a movie is in.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to add relationships to the GraphQL type definitions to connect the nodes in the GraphQL API.
