= Adding Relationships
:type: challenge
:order: 4
:sandbox: true

Your challenge is to update the GraphQL type definitions from the previous lesson to include the `RATED` relationship between the `User` and `Movie` types.

A `User` can provide a 1-5 rating for a `Movie` by creating a `RATED` relationship between them. An integer `rating` property holds the user's rating for the movie.

Run this query in the Neo4j Sandbox to explore the `RATED` relationship between the `User` and `Movie` nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie{title: "Matrix, The"}) RETURN u,r,m
----

. Update the type definitions to create a new `Rated` interface which specifies `rating` property with an appropriate type.
+
[source,GraphQL]
----
interface Rated @relationshipProperties {
  ...
}
----
. Add the `RATED` relationship to the `User` type definition
+
[source,GraphQL]
----
type User {
  userId: ID!
  name: String!
  ...
}
----
. Construct a GraphQL query that uses the `RATED` relationship to return all the ratings for the user "Gloria Nelson".

== Summary

In this challenge, you created a new relationship between the `User` and `Movie` types and specified a relationship property.

In the next module, you will learn how to create, update, and delete data using GraphQL mutations.
