:order: 2

== Module Overview

In this module we get hands-on with the Neo4j GraphQL Library and the Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox. We'll learn about the structure of the generated GraphQL API when using the Neo4j GraphQL Library and how to define graph data models using GraphQL type definitions. We'll see how to use the Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox to build, and run GraphQL queries and how changes to the GraphQL type definitions drive the generated GraphQL API.
