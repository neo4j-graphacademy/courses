= The @auth Directive
:order: 1


The Neo4j GraphQL Library provides an `@auth` GraphQL schema directive that enables us to attach authorization rules to our GraphQL type definitions. The `@auth` directive uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication. Authenticated requests to the GraphQL API will include an `authorization` header with a Bearer token attached. For example:

[source,HTTP,role=nocopy]
----
POST / HTTP/1.1
authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyLCJyb2xlcyI6WyJ1c2VyX2FkbWluIiwicG9zdF9hZG1pbiIsImdyb3VwX2FkbWluIl19.IY0LWqgHcjEtOsOw60mqKazhuRFKroSXFQkpCtWpgQI
content-type: application/json
----

Refer to the https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/auth/[Auth section of the Neo4j GraphQL Library documentation^] for full information.

== Setup

To enable authorization with the Neo4j GraphQL Library we need to specify the JWT signing secret used to decode and validate tokens. For this lesson we will use the following JWT secret to validate our tokens:

[source]
----
dFt8QaYykR6PauvxcyKVXKauxvQuWQTc
----

When instantiating `Neo4jGraphQL` pass a config object that includes the JWT secret. For example:

[source,JavaScript,role=nocopy]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
  typeDefs,
  config: {
    jwt: {
      secret: "dFt8QaYykR6PauvxcyKVXKauxvQuWQTc"
    }
  }
});
----

This step has been completed in the initial Codesandbox we'll use for this lesson.
Open https://codesandbox.io/s/github/johnymontana/training-v3/tree/master/modules/graphql-apis/supplemental/code/04-graphql-apis-auth/begin?file=/.env[the Codesandbox using this link^], again forking and editing the `.env` file to add the connection credentials for your Neo4j Sandbox instance.
You'll notice we've included an additional environment variable to keep track of our JWT secret.

== JSON Web Token (JWT)

JWTs are a standard for representing and cryptographically verifying claims securely and are commonly used for authentication and authorization.
Implementing a sign-in flow and generating JWTs is beyond the scope of this course so we will use a few static JWTs for testing our authorization rules.
For an example of a sign-up/sign-in flow using GraphQL mutations and the Neo4j GraphQL Library see the https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/blob/master/examples/neo-push/server/src/gql/User.ts[`neo-push` example application^] in the `neo4j/graphql` repository.

=== Example JWTs

We will use the following JWTs to test the authorization rules we'll be adding to our GraphQL API. These tokens were generated using the JWT secret signing key above and can be validated using the same secret.

==== Token For Customer EmilEifrem7474

This token is the token we will use to make authenticated requests on behalf of the customer "EmilEifrem7474":

[source]
----
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJFbWlsRWlmcmVtNzQ3NCIsInJvbGVzIjpbImN1c3RvbWVyIl0sImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.YwftAMDTw6GqmYOFLGHC_f6UiUhfrJAGkZGfrGmiQ2U
----

The token's payload includes the following claims:

[source,JSON,role=nocopy]
----
{
  "sub": "EmilEifrem7474",
  "roles": ["customer"],
  "iat": 1516239022
}
----

==== Admin user token

This token is used to make authenticated requests to the GraphQL API as an "admin" user:

[source]
----
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJCb2JMb2JsYXc3Njg3Iiwicm9sZXMiOlsiYWRtaW4iXSwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.f2GKIu31gz39fMJwj5_byFCMDPDy3ncdWOIhhqcwBxk
----

It includes the following claims:

[source,JSON,role=nocopy]
----
{
  "sub": "BobLoblaw7687",
  "roles": ["admin"],
  "iat": 1516239022
}
----

We can use the online tool at https://jwt.io[jwt.io^] to encode/decode and validate tokens. Try pasting one of the above tokens into this tool to view the token's payload.
