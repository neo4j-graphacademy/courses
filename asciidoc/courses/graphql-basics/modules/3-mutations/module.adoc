= GraphQL Mutations
:order: 3

== Module Overview

In this module, you will continue your hands-on exploration of the Neo4j GraphQL Library and GraphQL Toolbox. 

You will create, update and delete data using GraphQL mutations. 

You will use "nested mutations" with the Neo4j GraphQL Library to perform mutation operations with relationships and execute multiple updates in a single mutation operation.
