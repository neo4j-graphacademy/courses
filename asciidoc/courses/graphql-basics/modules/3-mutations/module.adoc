= GraphQL Mutations
:order: 3

== Lesson Overview

In this module we continue our hands-on exploration of the Neo4j GraphQL Library and GraphQL Toolbox with a look at creating, updating, and deleting data using GraphQL mutations. We'll see how to leverage "nested mutations" with the Neo4j GraphQL Library that will enable us to perform mutation operations with relationships and execute multiple updates in a single mutation operation.
