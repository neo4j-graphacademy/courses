= Creating, Updating, And Deleting Nodes
:order: 1
:type: lesson

So far in the course, you have explored the Query API of the Neo4j GraphQL Library. In this section, you will learn about GraphQL mutation operations that create, update, or delete nodes and their properties in the database.

In the Neo4j GraphQL Toolbox, at the bottom of the Explorer pane, select *Mutation* from the type dropdown and click the "+" button to add the Mutation fields to the Explorer pane.

The default create, update, and delete mutation operations are generated for each type in the GraphQL schema and displayed in the query editor. Let's see how to use these mutations!

== Create

First, let's create a new Genre node to represent my favorite genre link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_fiction[Cli-Fi^] or, Science Fiction focused around Climate Change.

Run the following mutation query to create a new genre. 

[source,GraphQL]
----
mutation MyMutation {
  createGenres(input: {name: "CliFi"}) {
    genres {
      name
    }
  }
}
----

The response includes the details of the new "CliFi" node which has been created in the database:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "createGenres": { "genres": [{ "name": "CliFi" }] }
  }
}
----

Oops - I misspelled "Cli-Fi"! You can use the update mutation to change the name property of this node.

== Update

To filter for the node(s) you want to update - you would use a `where` argument with an update mutation operation.

This query filters for the misspelled "CliFi" node, then specifies the field values to be updated.

[source,GraphQL]
----
mutation MyMutation {
  updateGenres(where: { name_EQ: "CliFi" }, update: { name: "Cli-Fi" }) {
    genres {
      name
    }
  }
}
----

The response confirms that the `name` property has been updated:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "updateGenres": { "genres": [{ "name": "Cli-Fi" }] }
  }
}
----

== Delete

Similarly to the update mutation, you can use a `where` argument to filter for the node(s) you want to delete with a delete mutation.

This query will delete the "Cli-Fi" node:

[source,GraphQL]
----
mutation MyMutation {
  deleteGenres(where: { name_EQ: "Cli-Fi" }) {
    nodesDeleted
    relationshipsDeleted
  }
}
----

The number of deleted nodes and relationships are returned in the response as `nodesDeleted` and `relationshipsDeleted`. You can see that one node was deleted (the Cli-Fi genre node).

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "deleteGenres": {
      "nodesDeleted": 1,
      "relationshipsDeleted": 0
    }
  }
}
----

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about some GraphQL mutation operations available with the Neo4j GraphQL Library for working with nodes. 

In the next lesson, you will see how to perform mutations with relationships and more complex mutation operations with the nested mutation feature of the Neo4j GraphQL Library.
