= Building Tools

Now that your app is configured and ready to go, it's time to build some custom tools that read data from Neo4j.

In this module, you will:

* Register a tool that identifies similar movies using the Vector Search Index
* Register a tool that writes a Cypher statement and executes it against a Neo4j database
* Provide instructions to improve the Cypher statements the LLM generates
