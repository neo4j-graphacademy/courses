= Providing Example Cypher Statements
:type: challenge

// * modify the prompt to provide example Cypher statements the LLM can learn from
So far, the bot has handled everything that we've had to throw at it.
But we have only been asking simple questions.

== Six Degrees

Let's play the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon^] game.

> [copy]#How many degrees of separation are there between Viola Davis and Kevin Bacon?#

The agent provides the correct answer, six, but the game requires that you also name.
The output in the console shows that the path length is returned, but there is no.

To help the LLM, we can provide an example in the prompt to demonstrate how Cypher queries should be written.

Here is a query containing all of the information required to help the LLM solve the problem.

.Six Degrees Query
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = shortestPath(
  (p1:Person {{name: "Viola Davis"}})-[:ACTED_IN|DIRECTED*]-(p2:Person {{name: "Kevin Bacon"}})
)
WITH path, p1, p2, relationships(path) AS rels
RETURN
  p1 {{ .name, .born, link:'https://www.themoviedb.org/person/'+ p1.tmdbId }} AS start,
  p2 {{ .name, .born, link:'https://www.themoviedb.org/person/'+ p2.tmdbId }} AS end,
  reduce(output = '', i in range(0, length(path)-1) |
    output + CASE
      WHEN i = 0 THEN
       startNode(rels[i]).name + CASE WHEN type(rels[i]) = 'ACTED_IN' THEN ' played '+ rels[i].role +' in 'ELSE ' directed ' END + endNode(rels[i]).title
       ELSE
         ' with '+ startNode(rels[i]).name + ', who '+ CASE WHEN type(rels[i]) = 'ACTED_IN' THEN 'played '+ rels[i].role +' in '
    ELSE 'directed '
      END + endNode(rels[i]).title
      END
  ) AS pathBetweenPeople
----

_I can't imagine any scenario where an LLM would generate that..._


[TIP]
.Braces
====
Braces in prompt templates are treated as placeholders.

You must escape any braces that you use in example Cypher statements.
When escaping braces, `{` becomes `{{` and `}` becomes `}}`.
====

== Solution

Add the above Cypher statement to the `CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE` string, along with a description of what type of question the query can help with.

[source,cypher]
.Adding a Few-Shot Example
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/fewshot.py[tag=prompt]
----

The rest of the code will remain the same.

You can add as many few-shot examples to the prompt as necessary.
But beware, most LLM providers charge you are charged per token, and the larger the prompt, the higher the cost.

If you require many few-shot examples, you can always create multiple tools that call an instance of `GraphCypherQAChain` with a different Cypher generation prompt.


== Testing the Change

If you now ask the bot the same question, you should get a greatly improved answer.

== Summary

In this lesson, you created a tool capable of generating a Cypher statement to answer a specific question and execute it against the database.  But the Cypher it generates isn't perfect.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to handle edge cases by fine-tuning the prompt used to generate the Cypher statement.
