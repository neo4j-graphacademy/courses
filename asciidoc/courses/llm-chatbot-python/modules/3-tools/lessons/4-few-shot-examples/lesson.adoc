= Providing Example Cypher Statements
:type: challenge
:order: 4

// * modify the prompt to provide example Cypher statements the LLM can learn from
So far, the bot has handled everything that we've had to throw at it.
But we have only been asking simple questions.

== Six Degrees

Let's play the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon^] game.
Let's pick an Actor at random and ask the Chatbot to identify the connections.

[copy]#How many degrees of separation are there between +
Viola Davis and Kevin Bacon?#

The agent provides the correct answer, six, but the game also requires that you name the movies that connect them.
The output in the console shows that the path length is returned, but there is no information about the movies in that path.

To help the LLM, we can provide an example in the prompt to demonstrate how Cypher queries should be written.

Here is a query containing all of the information required to help the LLM solve the problem.

.Six Degrees Query
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = shortestPath(
  (p1:Person {{name: "Viola Davis"}})-[:ACTED_IN|DIRECTED*]-(p2:Person {{name: "Kevin Bacon"}})
)
WITH path, p1, p2, relationships(path) AS rels
RETURN
  p1 {{ .name, .born, link:'https://www.themoviedb.org/person/'+ p1.tmdbId }} AS start,
  p2 {{ .name, .born, link:'https://www.themoviedb.org/person/'+ p2.tmdbId }} AS end,
  reduce(output = '', i in range(0, length(path)-1) |
    output + CASE
      WHEN i = 0 THEN
       startNode(rels[i]).name + CASE WHEN type(rels[i]) = 'ACTED_IN' THEN ' played '+ rels[i].role +' in 'ELSE ' directed ' END + endNode(rels[i]).title
       ELSE
         ' with '+ startNode(rels[i]).name + ', who '+ CASE WHEN type(rels[i]) = 'ACTED_IN' THEN 'played '+ rels[i].role +' in '
    ELSE 'directed '
      END + endNode(rels[i]).title
      END
  ) AS pathBetweenPeople

_I can't imagine how much training it would take to get an LLM to write a `reduce` function like that..._


== Solution

Add the above Cypher statement to the `CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE` string, along with a description of what type of question the query can help with.

[source,cypher]
.Adding a Few-Shot Example
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/fewshot.py[tag=prompt]
----

The rest of the code will remain the same.


[TIP]
.Braces
====
Braces in prompt templates are treated as placeholders.

You must escape any braces that you use in example Cypher statements.
When escaping braces, `{` becomes `{{` and `}` becomes `}}`.
====

=== Adding Additional Examples

You can add as many few-shot examples to the prompt as necessary.
But beware, most LLM providers charge you are charged per token, and the larger the prompt, the higher the cost.

If you require many few-shot examples, you can always create multiple tools that call an instance of `GraphCypherQAChain` with a different Cypher generation prompt.


== Testing the Change

If you now ask the bot the same question, you should get a greatly improved answer.
