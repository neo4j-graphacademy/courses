= Text to Cypher Tool
:type: challenge
:order: 2

In the previous challenge, you created a tool that used the `Neo4jVector` Store and Retriever to identify movies with similar plots to the user's input.
This approach may be relatively easy to set up, but as you learned in link:/courses/llm-fundamentals/2=vectors-semantic-search/[Vectors & Semantic Search module of the Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals] course, this approach can have its drawbacks.

Semantic Search using Vector Similarity relies on relative proximity in vector space, which may not provide a precise match.

Graph-enhanced semantic search combines the nuanced understanding of data from vector search with the contextual insights provided by graph features, leading to search results with greater depth and relevance by considering the relationships and hierarchies between entities within a broader knowledge network.

In this challenge, you will create a tool that uses the structure of the graph to generate a Cypher statement to answer a question.

To complete this challenge, you must:

1. Create a Graph Cypher QA Chain
2. Register the Chain as a Tool

== Creating a Graph Cypher QA Chain

To create a QA Chain that generates Cypher, you must import the `GraphCypherQAChain`.

In the `tools/` folder, create a new file called `cypher.py`.
Copy the following code to import the `GraphCypherQAChain` and the `Neo4jGraph` store object created in link:../../2-configuration/2-neo4j/[Connecting to Neo4j lesson^].

.Importing Dependencies
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/cypher.py[tag=import]
----

The `GraphCypherQAChain` provides a static `.from_llm()` method for creating a new instance.
The method requires one positional parameter, the `llm` and the GraphStore as the named `graph` parameter.

.Creating a GraphCypherQAChain
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/cypher.py[tag=cypher-qa]
----

The chain will use the schema generated by the `Neo4jGraph` class to write a Cypher statement and execute it against the database.


== Registering the Graph Cypher QA Chain as a Tool

Follow the instructions in the previous step to create a new `Tool` and append it to the `tools` list in `agent.py`.

Start by importing the tool.

.Importing the GraphCypherQAChain
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/cypher.py[tag=importcypherqa]
----

Append a new `Tool` to the `tools` array.
Give the tool a `name`, and a `description`.

The description should describe the information that can be retrieved from the database.
The `recommendations` dataset holds information on movies, actors, and user reviews that the LLM may find useful in generating a response.

Finally, define the `cypher_qa` as the function to call using the `func` named parameter.


.Registering the Tool
[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/cypher.py[tag=tool]
----


== Testing the Tool

You can test the new Cypher generation tool by asking the bot a question about a Movie.
For example, you could ask "[copy]#Who directed Toy Story?#".

You can check that the new tool has been called in the console.

        "action_input": "John Lasseter directed Toy Story."
    }

    > Finished chain.

With minimal configuration, the LLM can generate more complex questions.  For example, [copy]#Did the same director direct Toy Story and Toy Story 2?#

video::./images/who-directed-toy-story.mp4[role=cdn,width=610,height=410]

        "action_input": "Yes, the same director, John Lasseter, directed both Toy Story and Toy Story 2."
    }

== Summary

In this lesson, you created a tool capable of generating a Cypher statement to answer a specific question and execute it against the database.  But the Cypher it generates isn't perfect.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to handle edge cases by fine-tuning the prompt used to generate the Cypher statement.
