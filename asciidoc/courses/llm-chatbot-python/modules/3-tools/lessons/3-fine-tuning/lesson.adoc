= Fine-tuning The Cypher Generation
:order: 3

Have you tried asking the bot [copy]#Who directed The Matrix?#

If you ask it, it should respond telling you that it cannot provide an answer.
This is due to a peculiarity in the data.

Your challenge is to update the instructions used during the Cypher generation process.

== The Problem

In the previous module, as part of link:../../2-configuration/4-defining-scope/[defining the scope of the chatbot^], we included an instruction not to answer the question if it was not provided in the context.

If you take a look at the database movies with a title starting with _The_ have the _The_ portion moved to the end in the `.title` property.
For example, **The 39 Steps** is stored as **39 Steps, The**.

To fix this or any other data-related discrepancies, we can fine-tune the Cypher generation process by modifying the instructions used by the LLM when generating the Cypher statement.

[TIP]
.Original Prompts
====
You can https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/graph_qa/prompts.py[view the the default prompts used to instruct the LLM^] for inspiration.

Make sure that your prompt includes two placeholders, `\{schema}` and `\{question}`.
====

The template you provide must be a string that includes these two placeholders.


== The Solution

In `tools/cypher.py`, you must create a `PromptTemplate`.
Start by importing the `PromptTemplate` class.

[source,python]
.Imports
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/fewshot.py[tag=import-prompt-template]
----


Next, create a variable called `CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE` and set it to a string containing some instructions.
Remember to include the `\{schema}` and `\{question}` placeholders.

[source,python]
.Creating a template
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/fewshot.py[tag=prompt]
----

The `PromptTemplate` class has a static `.from_template()` method that allows you to pass a plain string.
Use this method to create a variable called `cypher_prompt`.

[source,python]
.Cypher Template
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/fewshot.py[tag=template]
----

Finally, append the `cypher_prompt` keyword argument to the `initialize_agent()` function call.

[source,python]
.Append the Cypher Prompt argument
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/solutions/tools/fewshot.py[tag=cypher-qa]
----

== Testing the Prompt

Ask the question [copy]#Who directed The Matrix?# and keep an eye on the console.
You should see that the Cypher statement is now generated with `, The` appended to the string.

== Summary

In this lesson, you used fine-tuning to fix a problem with Cypher statement generation.

In the next lesson, you will learn how few-shot prompting can help improve the quality of the Cypher statements generated by the LLM.
