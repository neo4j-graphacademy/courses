= Defining the Chatbot scope
:type: challenge
:order: 4
:branch: main
:disable-cache: true

You now have a working agent capable of communicating with an underlying LLM.
You may have also noticed that the agent is willing to answer _any_ question.
Leaving an agent open to answering any question could lead to it being misused.

You can restrict the agent's scope by providing specific instructions in the prompt.
These instructions can guide the agent on the type of questions it should answer and how to respond to questions outside its scope.

== Restricting Scope

In the previous challenge, you used the Langchain hub to download the link:https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react-chat?organizationId=d9a804f5-9c91-5073-8980-3d7112f1cbd3[`hwchase17/react-chat` prompt^] for ReAct Agents.

include::./includes/original-prompt.txt[]
----

The important elements in the prompt are:

* An instruction to use the list of tools to perform an action
* A placeholder for listing descriptions of the available tools (`{tools}`) and their names (`{tool_names}`)
* Instructions on how to instruct the LLM on which tool to use
* The previous chat history (`{chat_history}`)
* The user's current input (`{input}`)
* A _scratchpad_ of previous thoughts (`{agent_scratchpad}`)

[TIP]
You can experiment with the link:https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react-chat?organizationId=d9a804f5-9c91-5073-8980-3d7112f1cbd3[prompt^] in the link:https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react-chat/playground[Prompt Playground^]

=== Updating the Instructions

The instructions at the start of the prompt (before the TOOLS section) describe the agent's role.
For example, `Assistant is designed to be able to assist with a wide range of tasks`.

Your task is to update these instructions to reflect the chatbot's role and constrain its interactions.

For the movie chatbot, you could provide the following instructions:

[source,text]
.New Instructions
----
include::./includes/opening-instructions.txt[]
----

The following instructions set the scope of the chatbot:

* `You are a movie expert providing information about movies.`
* `Be as helpful as possible and return as much information as possible.`
* `Do not answer any questions that do not relate to movies, actors or directors.`

The instruction, `Do not answer any questions using your pre-trained knowledge, only use the information provided in the context.`, reminds the LLM to use the context provided in the prompt to answer questions.
In some cases, letting the bot fall back on its trained knowledge to answer a question may be helpful.

You can also throw in a whimsical instruction to make sure the prompt is working:

* `Respond to all questions in pirate speak.`

=== Create a `PromptTemplate`

Add the new prompt to `agent.py` by creating a new `PromptTemplate` using the `PromptTemplate.from_template()` method:

[source,python]
.Import PromptTemplate
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/solutions/agent-scoped.py[tag=import_prompt]
----

Then, replace the `agent_prompt` variable with the updated instructions:

[source,python]
.Define the Agent Prompt
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/solutions/agent-scoped.py[tag=agent_prompt]
----

The agent initialization code will stay the same.

[source,python]
.Agent initialization
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/solutions/agent-scoped.py[tag=agent]
----

== Testing the changes

If you now ask the bot a question unrelated to movies, for example, [copy]#Who is the CEO of Neo4j?#, it will refuse to answer.

== Summary

In this lesson, you defined the agent's scope by providing a specific prompt when creating the agent.

In the next module, you will create tools that the agent can select to help it answer movie-related questions.
