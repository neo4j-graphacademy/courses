In the link:/courses/llm-fundamentals/3-intro-to-langchain/[Initializing the LLM lesson of Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^], you learned how to initialize an LLM class and generate a response from an LLM.

In this lesson, you will need to put this learning into practice by creating an LLM instance to communicate with a GPT model using OpenAI.

You will need to:

1. Obtain an API key from link:https://platform.openai.com[platform.openai.com]
2. Create a secrets file to save the API key
3. Initialize an instance of the `ChatOpenAI`
4. Create an instance of the `OpenAIEmbeddings` model

== Setting Streamlit Secrets

To keep it secure, you will store the API key in the Streamlit `secrets.toml` file.

Create a new file, `.streamlit/secrets.toml`, and copy the following text, adding your OpenAI API key.


..streamlit/secrets.toml
[source,toml]
----
include::./includes/secrets.toml[]
----

[NOTE]
We have found that using `gpt-4` yields the best results, but you can also link:https://platform.openai.com/docs/models[select a different model if you are concerned about costs^].

You can access values stored in the `secrets.toml` file using `st.secrets`:

[source,python, role=nocopy]
.Accessing Secrets
----
import streamlit as st

openai_api_key = st.secrets['OPENAI_API_KEY']
openai_model = st.secrets['OPENAI_MODEL']
----

[WARNING]
.Keep your secrets safe
====
The Streamlit documentation link:https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/secrets-management[outlines four approaches to handling secrets and credentials^] in your application.

Ensure you do not share or include your API keys in a `git commit`.
The `.gitignore` file includes the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file, so git won't push the API key to Github.
====


== Initializing an OpenAI LLM

As you will use the LLM across the application, you should include the LLM instance in a module that you can import.

Open the `llm.py` file in the project root.

Create a new `llm` instance of the `ChatOpenAI` class:

[source,python]
.llm.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/solutions/llm.py[tag=llm]
----

The LLM is initialized with the `openai_api_key` and `model` stored in the secrets.toml file.

== Initializing an Embedding Model

To use the Vector Search Index, you must create an instance of the `OpenAIEmbeddings` model.
Langchain will use this when creating embeddings to find similar documents to the user's input using Neo4j's vector index. 

[source,python]
.llm.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/solutions/llm.py[tag=embedding]
----

== Using the LLM

Once you have completed the steps, you can `import` the `llm` and `embeddings` objects into other modules within the project.

[source,python, role=nocopy]
from llm import llm, embeddings


== That's it!

== Summary

In this lesson, you have created the classes required to interact with OpenAI's LLMs.

In the next lesson, you will create the classes required to connect to Neo4j.
