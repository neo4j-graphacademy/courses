= Introduction


As you progress through this course, you will modify a link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/llm-chatbot-python[pre-built repository^] to build a chatbot.
// TODO: We can't really test the response that comes back from the LLM - how can we validate that the user has written the correct code?
The challenges in this course are all optional, but we recommend that you complete them, as at the end of the course you will have a template that can be used for your future Generative AI Projects.


== An introduction to Streamlit

We have chosen to implement the chatbot using link:https://streamlit.io/[Streamlit].

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows developers to create web applications for data-centric projects with minimal effort.

With minimal code, developers and data scientists can convert data scripts into functional web applications without needing to write front-end-specific code.
Its simple API and compatibility with existing Python-based projects and tools means that integration is seamless, reducing the overhead typically associated with web application development.


Streamlit provides methods to create link:https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/chat[Chat elements^], making it trivial to build a chatbot interface.
This means that we can concentrate on the chatbot logic.

Streamlit is link:https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/[available on PyPI^] and can be installed using the `pip install` command.

.Installing Streamlit
[source,sh]
pip install streamlit

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start accessing components through the `st` object.

.app.py
[source,python]
----
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Hello",
    page_icon="ðŸ‘‹",
)

st.write("# Welcome to Streamlit! ðŸ‘‹")

st.markdown("""
This component supports **markdown formatting**, which is handy.

[Check out their documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) for more information on how to get started.
""")
----

To run the app, execute the `streamlit run` command.

[source,sh]
streamlit run app.py


Running this command will start a server listening on http://localhost:8501.

If you take a look at the top right corner of the screenshot, you will see a notification saying  _Source file changed_.
This menu will appear when you make changes to the source code.
To reload the changes once, you can click the **[.underline]#R# erun** button, or to hot-reload changes as they are saved, you can click **[.underline]#A# lways rerun**.

[TIP]
.Deploying your app
You can quickly link:https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app[share your app with others through the Streamlit Community Cloud^] by clicking the  **Deploy** button.



== LLM Integration with Langchain

At the start of the course, the AI assistant simply _repeats_ the user input.
But this AI assistant will become smarter as we write the code for it to communicate with an LLM.

If you have link:/courses/llm-fundamentals/[completed the Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals course^], you will be familiar with Langchain.
link:https://langchain.com[LangChain^] is an open-source framework designed to accelerate the development of LLM applications.
We have chosen Langchain because it provides a flexible base to test LLMs, and out-of-the-box chains for performing complex tasks.

Although we have chosen Streamlit, you will be able to use these components with the backend framework of your choice.

== Complete Local or Online

In the next lesson, you will set up your project.
You can either complete download the repository and complete the exercises locally, or you can use the **Open in Gitpod** buttons to complete the challenges using an Online IDE.

Are you ready?
