:order: 1

To get you started, we have link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/llm-chatbot-python[created a simple Chatbot interface^].
When you first get the project up and running, it will simply repeat your messages back to you.

But as you progress through the course, you will build the functionality to turn the Chatbot into an _intelligent_ movie recommendation assistant.
It will use the data held in a Neo4j database to improve the responses generated by an LLM.



First, let's take a look at the technology choices we have chosen.



== An introduction to Streamlit

We have chosen to implement the chatbot using link:https://streamlit.io/[Streamlit].

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows developers to create web applications for data-centric projects with minimal effort.

With minimal code, developers and data scientists can convert data scripts into functional web applications without needing to write front-end-specific code.
Its simple API and compatibility with existing Python-based projects and tools means that integration is seamless, reducing the overhead typically associated with web application development.


Streamlit provides methods to create link:https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/chat[Chat elements^], making it trivial to build a chatbot interface.
This means that we can concentrate on the chatbot logic.

Streamlit is link:https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/[available on PyPI^] and can be installed using the `pip install` command.

.Installing Streamlit
[source,sh]
pip install streamlit

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start accessing components through the `st` object.

.app.py
[source,python]
----
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Hello",
    page_icon="ðŸ‘‹",
)

st.write("# Welcome to Streamlit! ðŸ‘‹")

st.markdown("""
This component supports **markdown formatting**, which is handy.

[Check out their documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) for more information on how to get started.
""")
----

To run the app, execute the `streamlit run` command.

[source,sh]
streamlit run app.py


Running this command will start a server listening on http://localhost:8501.

If you take a look at the top right corner of the screenshot, you will see a notification saying  _Source file changed_.
This menu will appear when you make changes to the source code.
To reload the changes once, you can click the **[.underline]#R# erun** button, or to hot-reload changes as they are saved, you can click **[.underline]#A# lways rerun**.

[TIP]
.Deploying your app
You can quickly link:https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app[share your app with others through the Streamlit Community Cloud^] by clicking the  **Deploy** button.



== LLM Integration with Langchain

At the start of the course, the AI assistant simply _repeats_ the user input.
But this AI assistant will become smarter as we write the code for it to communicate with an LLM.

If you have link:/courses/llm-fundamentals/[completed the Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals course^], you will be familiar with Langchain.
link:https://langchain.com[LangChain^] is an open-source framework designed to accelerate the development of LLM applications.
We have chosen Langchain because it provides a flexible base to test LLMs, and out-of-the-box chains for performing complex tasks.

Although we have chosen Streamlit, you will be able to use these components with the backend framework of your choice.

== LLMs from OpenAI

We have included instructions to integrate the Chatbot with link:https://openai.com[OpenAI's] Large Language Models.

OpenAI has gained prominence through its Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) series. GPT models are trained on vast datasets to generate text that mimics human writing. The release of GPT-3, and subsequently GPT-4, showcased improvements in language understanding and generation, increasing their application in various industries. The practical utility of these models in tasks like writing assistance, programming, and language translation has led to widespread adoption and attention.

You are by no means restricted to OpenAI, however.
The hands-on challenges in this course are LLM-agnostic and you are free to use one of the 60+ supported LLMs.

[TIP]
.Open-Source Alternatives
====
If you are looking for an open-source alternative, we recommend that you link:https://github.com/docker/genai-stack/[take a look at the GenAI Stack^].
The GenAI Stack consisting of link:https://langchain.com[LangChain^] applications connecting to LLMs served by link:https://https://ollama.ai/[Ollama^], run within link:https://docker.com[Docker^] containers and backed by a Neo4j database.
