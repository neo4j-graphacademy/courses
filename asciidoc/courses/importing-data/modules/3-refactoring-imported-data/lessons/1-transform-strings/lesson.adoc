=== Confirming types in the graph

Neo4j Browser returns datetime properties as strings and it is sometimes hard to determine what the type stored in the graph is.

For example, here we return the _born_ property of five _Person_ nodes.

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/return-new-born-property.png[Born property,width=600,align=center]

In Neo4j Browser, the _born_ property appears like a string, but it is not a string.
We can actually extract the year from the property because it is a datetime:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/return-year-of-born-property.png[Born property year,width=600,align=center]

As you move closer to the data model, you may want to confirm that the properties in the graph represent the types in the data model.

You can use this Cypher code to show the stored types for the node properties in the graph:

[source,Cypher]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/shared/apoc-meta-nodetypeproperties.cypher[]
----

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/return-node-types.png[Meta types of node properties,width=600,align=center]

And you can do the same type of investigation of types for relationship properties:

[source,Cypher]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/shared/apoc-meta-nodetypeproperties.cypher[]
----

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/return-rel-types.png[Meta types of relationship properties,width=600,align=center]

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about some of transformations you need to do to load CSV data into your graph where the data types match the graph data model.
In the next challenge, you practice transforming data the data that you previously imported from  CSV files.
