In this Challenge, you will working with the data you previously imported with the Data Importer and did some transformations already.


[IMPORTANT]
You can only perform the steps of this Challenge if you have imported the data in an earlier Challenge and have transformed data to  Date and StringArray types, and added the _Actor_ and _Director_ labels.

This challenge has 4 steps:

. Create the constraint for the _Genre_ nodes.
. Create the _Genre_ nodes.
. Remove the _genres_ property.
. Verify your final schema for the data model

As a reminder, here is the data model we are moving toward where you see that we want to add the _Genre_ nodes to the graph.

== Step 1: Create the constraint

Execute this code in the sandbox on the right to add the uniqueness constraint for the _Genre_ nodes to the graph:

[source,Cypher]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{previous-path}/create-genre-constraint.cypher[]
CREATE CONSTRAINT Genre_name IF NOT EXISTS ON (g:Genre) ASSERT g.name IS UNIQUE
----

After you have added this constraint, try running `SHOW CONSTRAINTS`.

== Step 2: Create the _Genre_ nodes

Execute this code in the sandbox on the right to create the _Genre_ nodes in the graph, and the _IN_GENRE_ relationships:

[source,Cypher]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{previous-path}/merge-genre-nodes.cypher[]
----

Your execution should create 17 _Genre_ nodes and 212 _IN_GENRE_ relationships.

== Step 3: Remove the _genres_ property

Now that we have the _Genre_ nodes, we no longer need the _genres_ property in the _Movie_ nodes.

Run code into the sandbox on the right to remove the _genres_ property.

[source,Cypher]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{previous-path}/remove-genres-property.cypher[]
----

Your execution should set 93 properties.

== Step 4: View the final schema

Your post-import refactoring of the graph should now be complete. View the schema.

== Summary

In this challenge, you performed the final steps to refactor the graph to match the target data model.
In the next module, you learn about importing larger datasets.
