== Final steps toward the data model

In the course, link:/courses/modeling-fundamentals/[Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals^], you learned that you can refactor the graph so that key queries of the application will perform better.
Adding the labels as you did in the previous Challenge was a type of graph refactoring also.

In the Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals course, you learned how to turn a property of type list into a set of nodes with relationships.

In this lesson, we review that code and in the next challenge, you will complete the refactoring of the graph for our target data model.

Our target data model contains _Genre_ nodes where each _Movie_ node has an _IN_GENRE_ relationship to one or more _Genre_ nodes.

=== Adding a uniqueness constraint for _Genre_ nodes

When you used the Data Importer, it automatically created the uniqueness constraints in the graph for the unique IDs you specified when you imported the data.

You can view the constraints defined in the graph with the `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` command in Neo4j Browser:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/show-constraints.png[Constraints defined,width=600,align=center]

Here we see that we have three constraints that were created for us by the Data Importer.

A best practice is to always have a unique ID for every type of node in the graph.
We want to also have a uniqueness constraint for the _Genre_ nodes we will be creating in the graph.
Having a uniqueness constraint defined helps with performance when creating nodes and also for queries.
The `MERGE` clause looks up nodes using the property value defined for the constraint.
With a constraint, it is a quick lookup and if the node already exists, it is not created.

Here is the code we use to create this uniqueness constraint for the _name_ property of _Genre_ nodes:

[source,Cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{path}/create-genre-constraint.cypher[]
----

You will be adding this constraint in the next Challenge.

=== Creating the _Genre_ nodes from the _genres_ property of _Movie_ nodes

The next step is to retrieve all _Movie_ nodes and use the values in the _genres_ property to create the _Genre_ node if it does not already exist and point to it with the _IN_GENRE_ relationship.

Here is the code you will be executing in the next Challenge to do this:

[source,Cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{path}/merge-genre-nodes.cypher[]
----

The `UNWIND` clause expands the elements in _genres_ list for the node as rows. With this data, it creates the _Genre_ node using `MERGE`.
With `MERGE`, it only creates the node if it does not already exist.
Then it creates the relationship between the _Movie_ node and the _Genre_ node.


=== Removing the _genres_ property

After you have created the _Genre_ nodes and their relationships to the _Movie_ nodes, you will simply remove the _genres_ property from the graph.

[source,Cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{path}/remove-genres-property.cypher[]
----

Again, you will be doing this step in the next Challenge.

=== Confirming the final schema

Here we can view the visualization of the schema to confirm that it matches our data model.

== Summary

In this lesson, you reviewed how to create nodes from properties in the graph.
In the next Challenge, you will complete the refactoring of the graph post-import to create the _Genre_ nodes.
