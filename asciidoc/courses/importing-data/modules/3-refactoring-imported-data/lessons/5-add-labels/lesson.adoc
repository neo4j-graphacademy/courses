== Moving toward the data model

Our data model has additional labels, _Actor_ and _Director_.

Having these specific labels is a best practice so that key queries will perform better, especially when the graph is large.

We must transform the _Person_ nodes to have these specific labels. If a person acted in a movie, then they will be labeled as an actor.
If a person directed a movie, they will be labeled as a director.

=== Adding the labels

Here is the code that we can use the add the _Actor_ label to all nodes that have the _ACTED_IN_ relationship:

----
include::{repository-raw}/{path}/set-actor-label.cypher[]

In the next challenge, you will add the _Actor_ and _Director_ labels to the graph.
