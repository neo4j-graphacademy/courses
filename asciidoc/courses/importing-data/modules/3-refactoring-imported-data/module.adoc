= Refactoring Imported Data


[.transcript]
== Module Overview

If you used the Data Importer, you have learned that it imports all properties as string, integer, float, datetime, or boolean types.
In addition, you cannot customize how the graph data model is implemented during the import.

In this module, you will learn how to:

* View the types of properties stored in the graph.
* Transform multi-value properties to list properties.
* Add labels to the graph.
* Create nodes from property values.
