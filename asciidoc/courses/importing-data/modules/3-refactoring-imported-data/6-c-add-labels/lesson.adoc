= Adding labels to the graph
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

In this Challenge, you will working with the data you previously imported with the Data Importer and did some transformations already.


[IMPORTANT]
You can only perform the steps of this Challenge if you have imported the data in an earlier Challenge and have transformed data to Long, Double, Date, and StringArray types.

This challenge has 3 steps:

. Add the _Actor_ label to the _Person_ nodes.
. Add the _Director_ label to the _Person_ nodes.
. View the labels stored in the graph.

As a reminder, here is the data model we are moving toward where you see that we want _Person_ nodes to have the _Actor_ label and/or _Director_ label, depending upon the type of relationship to a _Movie_ node.

== Step 1: Add the Actor labels

Execute this code in the sandbox on the right to add the Actor labels to the graph:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->()
WITH DISTINCT p SET p:Actor
----

This code should update 353 nodes in the graph.

== Step 2: Add the Director labels

Modify and run the code you just executed to add the _Director_ labels to the nodes.

Your execution should update 97 nodes in the graph.

== Step 3: Examine the new labels in the graph


Run code into the sandbox on the right to view the node labels.  _Person_ nodes now have the additional labels of _Actor_ and/or _Director_.

== Summary

In this challenge, you transformed the multi-value string data to list (StringArray) types to match our target data model.
In the next lesson, you learn how to refactor the graph to add labels.
