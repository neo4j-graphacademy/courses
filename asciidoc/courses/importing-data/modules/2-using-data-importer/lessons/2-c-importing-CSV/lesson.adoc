In this Challenge, you will import the movie data that you have seen in the previous module.

This challenge has 11 steps:

. Download the CSV files.
. Open the Data Importer.
. Load the CSV files into the Data Importer.
. Define the Person nodes mapping.
. Define the Movie nodes mapping.
. Define the User nodes mapping.
. Define the DIRECTED relationships mapping.
. Define the ACTED_IN relationships mapping.
. Define the RATED relationships mapping.
. Save your mappings.
. Import the CSV data
. View the imported data.

The graph data model you will be implementing is the following:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/movie-data-model.png[Movie Data Model,width=600,align=center]

Notice the types for the properties. When you define the mapping for the import, you will need to be mindful of the types that can be automatically mapped (string, integer, decimal) and that the key values for your properties may be different from what is in the CSV files.

== Step 1: Download the CSV files

Download the following https://data.neo4j.com/importing/movieData.zip[file^] to your system:

Uncompress this file. You should have these files:

* persons.csv
* movies.csv
* ratings.csv
* directed.csv
* acted_in.csv

== Step 2: Open the Data Importer

In a Web browser window, open the https://data-importer.graphapp.io/?acceptTerms=true[Neo4j Data Importer^]

When you open Data Importer, you must connect to the sandbox instance for this course.
Before you import the data, you must have the information about the Neo4j instance you will be importing into.
The Host location should be a WebSocket bolt URL for the sandbox that was created for you for this course.
You should have received an email with this information, but  a sandbox, by default exists for only three days and the sandbox is recreated when you continue the course.
If the credentials mailed to you do not work, or you do not have them:

. Go to the https://sandbox.neo4j.com[sandbox site^].
. Log in to see the details of your blank sandbox instance:
. You can view the blank sandbox details by clicking the right-most dropdown for the sandbox. Here is where you will see the connection details:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/blank-sandbox-credentials.png[Blank Sandbox credentials,width=600,align=center]

Enter the bolt+s as the protocol, WebSocket URL, and password  into this dialog, then click **Connect**.

Then, you should see this:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/data-importer-c.png[Neo4j Data Importer,width=600,align=center]

[NOTE]
--
The Neo4j Data Importer may have changed since this course was published.
You will see minor differences in the UI.

If you see nodes and relationships in the Graph Model pane, you should select all of them and delete them so you can start with a new mapping.
Alternatively, you can select the "..." to the right of **Run Import** button and select **Clear all**.

== Step 3: Load the CSV files into the Data Importer

In the left *Files* panel, add the five CSV files you uncompressed in *Step 1*.

After you have added them, you should see this:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/files-selected.png[Files added to Data Importer,width=600,align=center]

After you have loaded them, take a few minutes to review the headers used for each file.

== Step 4: Define the Person nodes mapping

. Click the Add node icon in the Graph Model pane.
. In the Mapping Details pane on the right:
.. Enter *Person* for the label.
.. Select the *persons.csv* file.
.. Under Properties, click *Add from File*.
... Select *All*.
... Click *Confirm*.
.. Notice that some property names do not match the graph data model. Modify them as follows:
... person_tmdbId --> tmdbId
... person_imdbId --> imdbId
... person_poster --> poster
... person_url --> url
.. Select *tmdbId* as the unique ID that will be used for these Person nodes.

You should see a green indicator in the left panel that all the properties have been mapped:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/person-properties-mapped.png[Person properties mapped,width=400,align=center]

== Step 5: Define the Movie nodes mapping

. Click the Add node icon in the Graph Model pane.
. In the Mapping Details pane on the right:
.. Enter *Movie* for the label.
.. Select the *movies.csv* file.
.. Under Properties, click *Add from File*.
... Select *All*.
... Click *Confirm*.
.. Notice that some property names do not match the graph data model. Modify them as follows:
... movie_tmdbId --> tmdbId
... movie_imdbId --> imdbId
... movie_poster --> poster
... movie_url --> url
.. Notice also that some property types do not match what our data model defines. Modify the property types as follows:
... budget --> integer
... revenue --> integer
.. Select *movieId* as the unique ID that will be used for these Movie nodes. Note that we have selected movieID as the unique ID because it is used in the other files when we define the relationships to movies.

[NOTE]
You cannot transform all fields to their target property types with the Data Importer. In the next Module of this course, you will perform some post-import refactoring of the graph.

You should see a green indicator in the left panel that all the properties have been mapped:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/movie-nodes-mapped.png[Movie nodes mapped,width=600,align=center]

== Step 6: Define the User nodes mapping

. Click the Add node icon in the Graph Model pane.
. In the Mapping Details pane on the right:
.. Enter *User* for the label.
.. Select the *ratings.csv* file.
.. Under Properties, click *Add from File*.
... Select only the *userId* and *name* properties. The other values will be used later to define relationships.
... Click *Confirm*.
.. Confirm that *userId* has been selected the unique ID that will be used for these User nodes.

[NOTE]
--
The Data Importer types all fields that end in "id" or "Id" as integers.
If there is one field with that name, it is automatically selected as the unique key.
You can always select a different unique key for your nodes.

You should see a green indicator in the left panel that all the properties have been mapped:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/user-nodes-mapped.png[User nodes mapped,width=600,align=center]

== Step 7: Define the DIRECTED relationships mapping

. In the Graph Model pane, drag the edge of the *Person* node onto the *Movie* node. This will define a relationship between these nodes in the graph.
. In the Mapping Details pane on the right:
.. Enter *DIRECTED* for the type.
.. Select the *directed.csv* file.
.. In the IDs section:
... Select person_tmdbId as the Person ID.
... Select movieId as the Movie ID.

There are no fields in the *directed.csv* file for role so you will not be importing the role property from this file, so you are done.

You should see a green indicator in the left panel that all the properties have been mapped:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/confirm-DIRECTED-done.png[DIRECTED relationships mapped,width=600,align=center]

== Step 8: Define the ACTED_IN relationships mapping

. In the Graph Model pane, drag the edge of the *Person* node onto the *Movie* node. This will define a relationship between these nodes in the graph.
. In the Mapping Details pane on the right:
.. Enter *ACTED_IN* for the type.
.. Select the *acted_in.csv* file.
.. In the IDs section:
... Select person_tmdbId as the Person ID.
... Select movieId as the Movie ID.
.. In the Properties section, select the *role* property.

You should see a green indicator in the left panel that all the properties have been mapped:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/acted-in-relationship-mapped.png[ACTED_IN relationships mapped,width=600,align=center]

== Step 9: Define the RATED relationships mapping

Note that this mapping will reuse the same file you used to define the User nodes.

. In the Graph Model pane, drag the edge of the *User* node onto the *Movie* node. This will define a relationship between these nodes in the graph.
. In the Mapping Details pane on the right:
.. Enter *RATED* for the type.
.. Select the *ratings.csv* file.
.. In the IDs section:
... Select userId as the User ID.
... Select movieId as the Movie ID.
.. In the Properties section, select the *rating*  and *timestamp* property.
.. Notice that a property type do not match the graph data model. Modify it as follows:
... rating --> integer


You should see a green indicator in the left panel that all the properties have been mapped:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/rated-relationships-mapped.png[RATED relationships mapped,width=600,align=center]

== Step 10: Save your mappings

In the event that something goes wrong during the import, we recommend that you save what you have mapped.

. Click the **...** to the right of the **Run Import** button.
. Select *Download Model*. The file with the name *neo4j_importer_model_yyyy-mm-dd.json* will be downloaded to your system.

== Step 11: Import the CSV data

Follow these steps to import the data:

. Click the *Run Import* button.
. It should import the data into your empty graph. (It will take a couple of minutes.)

== Step: 12: View the imported data

In the sandbox pane for this course, execute the following code to confirm that the data was imported.

Your graph should have 1097 nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/shared/count-nodes.cypher[]
----

And it should have 4065 relationships:


[source,cypher]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/shared/count-relationships.cypher[]
----

include::./questions/verify.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Summary

In this challenge, you imported a small set of movie data from CSV files using the Neo4j Data Importer.

In the next lesson, you learn that in some cases, you may need to perform some post-import processing.
