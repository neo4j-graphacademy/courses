== Data Importer Challenge

Welcome to **Neo4j Workspace**, the location for our challenge.
Neo4j Workspace is an online tool that combines developer tools into one convenient location.

* The btn:Explore[role="NX_TAB_NAV",tab="explore"] tab provides a no-code interface for exploring the guide.
* If you prefer to write Cypher, the btn:Query[role="NX_TAB_NAV",tab="query"] tab provides a query window and multiple result panes.
* The tab you are on now is the btn:Import[role="NX_TAB_NAV",tab="import"] tab, which allows you to map CSV data to your graph model and run a full import.

This challenge will take place in the btn:Import[role="NX_TAB_NAV",tab="import"] tab.

Click the **Next** button below to continue.

// ---------


== UI Refresher

The Import tool consists of three panes.

=== The Files pane

The leftmost pane is the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files pane].  As you add files to the importer, they will be listed here, along with the headers read from the file and an example value.

You can add new files by clicking the highlight:import/import-file-panel-browse-button[Add files button] at the top right of the pane.  The highlight:import/import-file-panel-browse-button[Add files button] will open a file dialog from which you can select files from your computer.  You may also drag and drop CSV or TSV files directly into the pane.

As you map column headers to your data model, a green indicator will appear to the left of the column name.


=== The Modelling pane

You will use the highlight:import/import-model-panel[Modelling pane] in the centre of the screen to define your data model.

To add your first node, click the highlight:import/import-add-node[Add node button].  To create relationships, position your mouse at the edge of the node until a blue ring appears.  Hold your mouse down and drag the course to an existing node to create a relationship, or release the mouse in an empty canvas area to create a relationship to a new node.

Nodes are deleted from the data model using the icon:TrashIcon[] highlight:import/import-delete-node-or-rel[button located here].


=== The Mapping details pane

You will use the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[Mapping details pane] to define the metadata for your data model.

Click on a Node or Relationship in the Modelling pane to update the model.  The form in the Mapping details pane will allow you to configure the selected entity, associate it with a file and assign file headers to properties.

Now that you are familiar with the UI, click **Next** to dive into the challenge.


// ---------

== Your Challenge

To pass this challenge, you must recreate the model below from the previous lesson using a set of CSV files contained in the link:{zip-directory}/movie-data.zip[movie-data.zip^] archive archive.

Your final data model will match the following diagram:

image::{cdn-url}/images/data-model.png[Movie Data Model,align=center]

The zip archive contains the following files:

* *persons.csv* - containing over 800 rows that will be used to create `(:Person)` nodes
* *movies.csv* - containing 93 rows that will be used to create `(:Movie)` nodes
* *acted_in.csv* - contains 372 rows that will be used to create the `(:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)` pattern
* *directed.csv* - contains 99 rows that will be used to create the `(:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)` pattern
* *ratings.csv* is a denormalised file that contains users identified by the `userId` column, and their ratings for movies.

As you create your data model, you must be mindful of the data types associated with each property - for example, the `tmdbId` property for a `(:Movie)` is an integer, and the `born` property for a `(:Person)` is a date.

Are you ready to get started?
Hit the **Next** button to continue.

// ---------


== 1. Download the CSV files

If you haven't already done so, you will first need to link:{zip-directory}/movie-data.zip[download and unzip the zip archive^].
Once downloaded, add the files by dragging and dropping them into the Files pane, or by clicking the highlight:import/import-file-panel-browse-button[Add files button] button.

You should now see the five files listed in the Files pane.

.Are you having trouble?
====
You can also click the following button to add the CSV files directly into Workspace.

button::Add CSV Files to Workspace[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint="{zip-directory}/movie-data.zip"]
====

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the headers used in each file, then click **Next** to create your first Node mapping.

// ---------


== 2. Creating the Person node mapping

image::{cdn-url}/images/step2-person-node.png[Person node with properties,align=center]

To create your first node mapping, click the highlight:import/import-add-node[Add node button] at the top left of the highlight:import/import-model-panel[Modelling pane].
You should now see a new Node with a dashed border in the center of your data model.


=== 2.1. Set the node label

You can either set the Label for the node by entering *Person* into the highlight:import/import-node-label[Label text box] within the Mapping details pane to the right of the data model or by double-clicking to focus the cursor on the node and typing *Person*.


=== 2.2. Map the node to the persons.csv file

From the highlight:import/import-node-file-dropdown[File dropdown], select *persons.csv*.


=== 2.3. Define the Node Properties

In the highlight:import/import-definition[Definition tab], click the
highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Select from file button] to show the **Select from file pane**.
A new dialog window should appear.
Check the *Select all* checkbox to the top right of the dialog, and click the **Confirm** button.

You should now see highlight:import/import-definition-and-mapping[a list of properties in the Definition tab].


=== 2.5. Rename Properties

Four headers in the persons.csv file do not match our target data model:

* `person_tmdbId`
* `person_imdbId`
* `person_poster`
* `person_url`

Click the icon:PencilIcon[] icon to edit the property name.

Remove the `person_` prefix from each column, then click the icon:CheckIcon[] icon to save the change.


=== 2.6. Set the Unique ID

Use the highlight:import/import-node-id[ID dropdown] to set the unique identifier to *tmdbId*.


=== 2.7. Verifying this Step

You should now see the following:

* Your data model has one node with a caption of Person and a solid border.
* In the Files pane, each column listed under highlight:import/import-file-persons.csv[persons.csv] should have a green indicator next to it.

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/person-properties-mapped.png[Person properties mapped,width=400,align=center]

// ---------

== 3. Define the Movie node mapping

image::{cdn-url}/images/step3-movie-node.png[Movie node with properties,align=center]

Complete the following steps to add a `(:Movie)` node to the data model.

=== 3.1. Add a New Node


Click the highlight:import/import-add-node[text="Add node button"] button to add a new node to the graph model.

=== 3.2. Update Mapping details

This time set the highlight:import/import-node-label[Label text box] to *Movie* and select *movies.csv* from the highlight:import/import-node-file-dropdown[File dropdown].


=== 3.3. Define the Node Properties

As in the previous step, open the highlight:import/import-definition[Definition tab] and click the highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Select from file button].

In the **Select from file** dialog, check the Select all checkbox to the top right and click the **Confirm** button to add all columns.

==== 3.4.1 Rename Headers

Three columns in this file don't match our data model; `movie_imdbId`, `movie_poster`, `movie_tmdbId`, and `movie_url`.

Click the icon:PencilIcon[] icon next to each column, remove the `movie_` prefix to correct the property name, and click the icon:CheckIcon[] icon to save the change.

==== 3.4.2 Update Data Types

The data types for budget and revenue don't match our data model.

Use the icon:PencilIcon[] icon to update the data type to `integer`, clicking the icon:CheckIcon[] icon to save the changes.

[TIP]
.Genres column
====
You may notice from the example value that the genres column is a pipe-separated list of genres.
We will convert these values into nodes in an upcoming lesson.
====


=== 3.4. Set the Unique ID

Set the unique identifier column for the Movie node by selecting *tmdbId* from the highlight:import/import-node-id[ID dropdown].


=== 3.5 Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see:

* Two nodes in your data model, labeled **Person** and **Movie**.
* Both of these nodes should have a solid border.
* In the files pane, each column listed under highlight:import/import-file-movies.csv[movies.csv] should have a green indicator next to it

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/movie-nodes-mapped.png[Movie nodes mapped,width=600,align=center]

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====
If you cannot check each of the items above, run through the steps again to see if you have missed anything.
If you are still stuck, you can click the following button to add the Movie node to the data model.

button::Add the Movie node[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint="{zip-directory}/step3-movie-node.zip"]
====

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the User node in the data model.

// ---------

== 4. Define the User node mapping

image::{cdn-url}/images/step4-user-node.png[User node with properties,align=center]

In this step, you will use the *ratings.csv* file to create User nodes.  The *ratings.csv* file is a denormalized file containing multiple ratings per user.

Selecting the correct ID property in the ID dropdown is essential for denormalized files.  This property is to find or create unique nodes from the file using the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/merge/[Cypher `MERGE` statement^] statement.


=== 4.1. Add a New Node

Click the highlight:import/import-add-node[text="Add node button"] button to add a new node to the graph model.

=== 4.2. Update Mapping details

This time set the highlight:import/import-node-label[Label text box] to *Movie* and select *movies.csv* from the highlight:import/import-node-file-dropdown[File dropdown].


=== 4.3. Define the Node Properties

In the highlight:import/import-definition[Definition tab], click the click the highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Select from file button] to open the **Select from file** dialog.

This file contains two headers that relate to a user:

* `userId`
* `name`

Select these columns and click **Confirm** to add them as properties in the Node definition.

[TIP]
--
The Data Importer will default all fields that end with `id` or `Id` as integers.
If a single file with this pattern exists in the file, it is treated as the unique identifier, and the highlight:import/import-node-id[ID dropdown] will be automatically populated.
--

=== 4.4. Set the Unique ID

As the `userId` column ends with `Id`, the highlight:import/import-node-id[ID dropdown] should already be populated with *userId*.
If it isn't, set the ID dropdown to *userId*.

=== 4.5 Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see:

* There are three circles in the Modelling pane labelled **Person**, **Movie** and **User**.
* Each of the nodes should have a solid border.
* In the files pane, the `userId` and `name` properties column listed under highlight:import/import-file-ratings.csv[ratings.csv] should have a green indicator next to them,

====

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the **DIRECTED** relationship in the data model.

// ---------


== 5. Adding the DIRECTED relationship

image::{cdn-url}/images/step5-directed-relationship.png[Directed relationship between Person and Movie nodes,align=center]

=== 5.1. Add the Relationship

Move your mouse to the edge of the Person node, click, and drag your mouse cursor to the Movie node to create a new relationship.

In the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[Mapping details pane], set the **Type text box** to *DIRECTED* and select *directed.csv* from the highlight:import/import-node-file-dropdown[File dropdown].


=== 5.2. Define the From and To columns

In the highlight:import/import-relationship-mapping-table[relationship mapping table below], you must select the columns in the CSV file that identify the nodes at the start and end of each relationship.

Select *person_tmdbId* as the highlight:import/import-rel-from-dropdown[text="From ID file column"] and *movieId* as the highlight:import/import-rel-from-dropdown[text="From ID file column"].


=== 5.3. Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see:

* A **DIRECTED** relationship from the **Person** node to the **Movie** node.
* The **DIRECTED** relationship should be a solid line.
* In the files pane, each column listed under highlight:import/import-file-directed.csv[directed.csv] should have a green indicator next to it.

====
If you cannot verify each item above, run through the steps again to see if you have missed anything.
If you are still stuck, click the following button to add the Movie node to the data model.

button::Add the DIRECTED relationship[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint="{zip-directory}/step5-directed-relationship.zip"]
====

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the **ACTED_IN** relationship in the data model.

// ---------

== 6. Adding the ACTED_IN relationship

image::{cdn-url}/images/step6-acted-in-relationship.png[Acted In relationship between Person and Movie nodes with properties,align=center]

The **ACTED_IN** relationship is similar to the **DIRECTED** relationship with the data defined in the `acted_in.csv` file.


=== 6.1. Add the Relationship

Move your mouse to the edge of the Person node, click, and drag your mouse cursor to the Movie node to create a second relationship.
You should now see an additional relationship drawn with dashed line from the **Person** node to the **Movie** node.

In the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[Mapping details pane], set the **Type text box** to *ACTED_IN* and select *acted_in.csv* from the highlight:import/import-node-file-dropdown[File dropdown].


=== 6.2. Define the From and To columns

In the highlight:import/import-relationship-mapping-table[relationship mapping table below], select *person_tmdbId* as the highlight:import/import-rel-from-dropdown[text="From ID file column"] and *movieId* as the highlight:import/import-rel-from-dropdown[text="From ID file column"].

=== 6.3. Define the Relationship Properties

The *acted_in.csv* file contains one property, **role**, which represents the actor's role in the movie.

In the highlight:import/import-definition[Definition tab], click the click the highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Select from file button] to open the **Select from file** dialog.

Select the *role* column and click **Confirm** to add the property to the relationship.


=== 6.4 Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see:

* Two relationships between the **Person** and **Movie** nodes, **ACTED_IN** and **DIRECTED**.
* Both relationships should be a solid line.
* In the files pane, each column listed under highlight:import/import-file-acted_in.csv[acted_in.csv] should have a green indicator next to it.

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the **RATED** relationship in the data model.


== 7. Adding the RATED relationship

image::{cdn-url}/images/step7-rated-relationship.png[Rated relationship between User and Movie nodes with properties,align=center]


In Step 4, we used the **ratings.csv** file to define the User node.  But
highlight:import/import-file-acted_in.csv[the file in the Files pane] has three unmapped columns.

These columns define the **RATED** relationship between the **User** and **Movie** nodes.


=== 7.1. Add the Relationship

Move your mouse to the edge of the **User** node, click, and drag your mouse cursor to the **Movie** node to create a new relationship.
You should now see a new dashed line pointing from the **User** node to the **Movie** node.

In the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[Mapping details pane], set the **Type text box** to *RATED* and select *ratings.csv* from the highlight:import/import-node-file-dropdown[File dropdown].

=== 7.2. Define the From and To columns

In the highlight:import/import-relationship-mapping-table[relationship mapping table below], select *userId* as the highlight:import/import-rel-from-dropdown[text="From ID file column"] and *movieId* as the highlight:import/import-rel-from-dropdown[text="From ID file column"].

=== 7.3. Define the Relationship Properties

The *ratings.csv* file contains two properties, rating and timestamp, which describe the user's rating.

In the highlight:import/import-definition[Definition tab], click the click the highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Select from file button] to open the **Select from file** dialog.

Select the *rating* and *timestamp* columns and click **Confirm** to add the property to the relationship.

=== 7.4. Update the rating data type

The *rating* property has been interpreted as a `float` when in fact it should be an `integer`.  Use the icon:PencilIcon[] icon to update the data type to `integer`.


=== 7.5 Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see:

* A **RATED** relationship defined from **User** to **Movie**.
* The **RATED** relationship should be a solid line.
* In the files pane, each column listed under highlight:import/import-file-ratings.csv[ratings.csv] should have a green indicator next to it.
