== Data Importer Challenge

Welcome to **Neo4j Workspace**, the location for our challenge.
Neo4j Workspace is an online tool that combines developer tools into one convenient location.

* The **Explore** tab provides a no-code interface for exploring the guide.
* If you prefer to write Cypher, the **Query** tab provides a query window and multiple result panes.
* The tab you are on now is the **Import** tab, which allows you to map CSV data to your graph model and run a full import.


=== Your Challenge

Your challenge is to recreate and import the data model from the previous lesson using the Data Importer UI.

To refresh your memory, the final data model will be as follows:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/movie-data-model.png[Movie Data Model,width=600,align=center]

The Data Importer has already been opened with your Neo4j Sandbox credentials provided.

=== The Data

The {zip-file}[movieData.zip file^] file contains the following files:

* `persons.csv` - containing over 800 rows that will be used to create `(:Person)` nodes
* `movies.csv` - containing 93 rows that will be used to create `(:Movie)` nodes
* `acted_in.csv` - contains 372 rows that will be used to create the `(:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)` pattern
* `directed.csv` - contains 99 rows that will be used to create the `(:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)` pattern
* `ratings.csv` is a denormalised file which contains users identified by the `userId` column, and their ratings for movies.

You may have also noticed the property types defined on the data model above.
When you define the mapping for the import, you will need to be mindful of the types that can be automatically mapped (string, integer, decimal, datetime) and that the key values for your properties may be different from what is in the CSV files.

Are you ready?
Hit the **Next** button to continue.


== Step 1: Download the CSV files

To prepare the files read for mapping, you will first need to {zip-file}[download the zip archive^], unzip the archive and then drag the files into the **Files** pane.

Once you have succesfully added the files, the left pane should look like like this:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/files-selected.png[Files added to Data Importer,width=600,align=center]

You can also click the following button to add the CSV files directly into Workspace.

button::Add CSV Files to Workspace[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={zip-file}]
====


Once you are done, take a few minutes to familiarise yourself with the headers used in each file and then click **Next** to create your first Node mapping.



== Step 2: Map Person Nodes

Complete the following actions to add a `(:Person)` node to the data model.

=== 1. Add a New Node

To create your first Node Mapping, click the **Add node** button at the top right of the Modelling pane.
// TODO: Make Add node clickable
You should now see a new Node with a dashed border in the centre of the Modelling pane.


=== 2. Update Mapping details

Inside the _Mapping details pane_ to the right of the data model:

1. Set the _Label_ to `Person`.
2. Select `persons.csv` from the _File_ dropdown.

=== 3. Define the Node Properties

In the **Definition** tab, click the **Select from file** button.
// TODO: Make select from file clickable
A new dialog window should appear.
Check the *Select all* checkbox to the to right of the dialog, and click the **Confirm** button.

=== 4. Rename Properties

Four headers in the `persons.csv` file do not match our target data model; `person_tmdbId`, `person_imdbId`, `person_poster` and `person_url`.
Click the icon:PencilIcon[] icon next to each column and rename each column to edit each column name, removing the `person_` prefix from each.
Once you have renamed the column, click the icon:CheckIcon[] to save the change.

// TODO: Only have one column to rename?

=== 5. Set the Unique ID

At the bottom of the Mapping details pane there is an ID dropdown menu.
Select `tmdbId` from the list to set this as the unique identifier for the import.

=== Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see:

* The node in the Modelling pane should have a caption of Person and a solid border
* In the files pane, each columns listed under **persons.csv** should have a green indicator next to it

If you cannot check each of the items above, run through the steps again to see if you have missed anything.
If you are still stuck, you can click the following button to add the Person node to the data model.

button::Add the Person node[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={zip-file}]
// TODO: Have a collapsible action that loads the model to the current stage
====

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the Movie node in the data model.


== Step 3: Define the Movie nodes mapping

Complete the following actions to add a `(:Movie)` node to the data model.

=== 1. Add a New Node

Click the **Add node** button at the top right of the Modelling pane to add a new node to the graph model.

=== 2. Update Mapping details

Set the label to **Movie** and select *movies.csv** from the File dropdown.


=== 3. Define the Node Properties

In the **Definition** tab, click  the **Select from file** button to open the **Select from file** dialog.

As with the Person node, you can check the *Select all* checkbox to select all fields and click **Confirm** to add all columns.


There are three column headers in this file that don't match our data model; `movie_imdbId`, `movie_poster`, `movie_tmdbId` and `movie_url`.
Click the icon:PencilIcon[] icon next to each column and rename each column, removing the `movie_` prefix from each.
Once you have renamed the column, click the icon:CheckIcon[] to save the change.


There are two columns in the `movies.csv` file that do not match our data model, `budget` and revenue.
Use the icon:PencilIcon[] icon to update the data type of these columns to **integer**.

[TIP]
.Genres column
====
You may notice that the genres column is a pipe-separated list of genres.
We will convert these values into nodes in an upcoming lesson.
====

=== 4. Set the Unique ID

Select `tmdbId` from the list of properties to set it as the unique identifier for each Movie.


=== Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see that:

* There are two circles in the Modelling pane labelled **Person** and **Movie**.
* Both of these nodes should have a solid border.
* In the files pane, each column listed under **movies.csv** should have a green indicator next to it

If you cannot check each of the items above, run through the steps again to see if you have missed anything.
If you are still stuck, you can click the following button to add the Movie node to the data model.

button::Add the Movie node[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={zip-file}]
// TODO: Have a collapsible action that loads the model to the current stage
====

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the User node in the data model.


== Step 4: Define the User nodes mapping

In this step, you will map the `ratings.csv` file, which is a denormalised file that may contain multiple ratings per user.

The steps to map denormalised files are similar, but we will only be using a selection of columns from this file.
In this case, it is important to correctly define the ID property in the fourth step.

=== 1. Add a New Node

Click the **Add node** button at the top right of the Modelling pane to add a new node to the graph model.

=== 2. Update Mapping details

Set the label to **User** and select *ratings.csv** from the File dropdown.


=== 3. Define the Node Properties

In the **Definition** tab, click the **Select from file** button to open the **Select from file** dialog.

This file contains two columns that relate to a user; `userId` and `name`.
Check the checkbox next to each of these columns and click **Confirm** to add them to the Node definition.

[TIP]
--
The Data Importer types all fields that end in "id" or "Id" as integers.
If there is one field with that name, it is automatically selected as the unique key.
You can always select a different unique key for your nodes.
--

=== 4. Set the Unique ID

As the `userId` column ends with `id`, the **ID** option should already be set.
If not, set the **ID** option to `userId`.


=== Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see that:

* There are three circles in the Modelling pane labelled **Person**, **Movie** and **User**.
* Each of these nodes should have a solid border.
* In the files pane, the `userId` and `name` properties column listed under **ratings.csv** should have a green indicator next to them

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the `-[:DIRECTED]->` relationship in the data model.


== Step 5: Adding the DIRECTED relationship

To create a relationship between two nodes in the data model, move your mouse to the edge of a Node and drag the cursor to another node.

=== 1. Add the Relationship

Move your mouse to the edge of the **Person** node, click, and drag your mouse to the **Movie** node.
You should now see a new dashed line pointing from the **Person** node to the **Movie** node.

In the **Mapping details** pane, enter `DIRECTED` into the Relationship *Type* text box and select `directed.csv` from the *File* dropdown.

=== 2. Define the From and To columns

In the table below, you must select the columns in the CSV file that identify the nodes at the start and end of each relationship.

Select `person_tmdbId` as the *From* column, and `movieId` as the *To* column.
// TODO: Screenshot

=== 3. Define the Relationship Properties

There are no additional properties in this file, so no additional definitions are required.


=== Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see that:

* A **DIRECTED** relationship has been defined from the **Person** node to the **Movie** node.
* The **DIRECTED** relationship should be a solid line.
* In the files pane, each column listed under `directed.csv` should have a green indicator next to it.

If you cannot check each of the items above, run through the steps again to see if you have missed anything.
If you are still stuck, you can click the following button to add the Movie node to the data model.

button::Add the Movie node[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={zip-file}]
// TODO: Have a collapsible action that loads the model to the current stage
====

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the `-[:ACTED_IN]->` relationship in the data model.


== Step 6: Adding the ACTED_IN relationship

The `-[:ACTED_IN]->` relationship is similar to the `-[:DIRECTED]->` relationship, but instead is defined in the `acted_in.csv` file.



=== 1. Add the Relationship

Move your mouse to the edge of the **Person** node, click, and drag your mouse to the **Movie** node.
You should now see a new second relationship, drawn with dashed line from the **Person** node to the **Movie** node.

In the **Mapping details** pane, enter `ACTED_IN` into the Relationship *Type* text box and select `acted_in.csv` from the *File* dropdown.

=== 2. Define the From and To columns

In the table below, you must select the columns in the CSV file that identify the nodes at the start and end of each relationship.

Select `person_tmdbId` as the *From* column, and `movieId` as the *To* column.
// TODO: Screenshot

=== 3. Define the Relationship Properties

The `acted_in.csv` file contains one property, the `role` that the actor played.

In the **Definition** tab, click the **Select from file** to open the **Select from file** dialog.
Select the `role` column and click **Confirm**.


=== Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see that:

* There are two relationships from the **Person** node to the **Movie** node, **ACTED_IN** and **DIRECTED**.
* Both relationships should ne a solid line.
* In the files pane, each column listed under `directed.csv` should have a green indicator next to it.

Once you have verified the steps above, click **Next** to define the `-[:RATED]->` relationship in the data model.


== Step 6: Adding the RATED relationship

In Step 4, we used the `ratings.csv` file to define the **User** node, but if you take a look in the Files pane, three columns have not yet been mapped.

We can use these unmapped columns to define the `-[:RATED]->` relationship between the **User** and **Movie** nodes.

=== 1. Add the Relationship

Move your mouse to the edge of the **User** node, click, and drag your mouse to the **Movie** node.
You should now see a new dashed line pointing from the **User** node to the **Movie** node.

In the **Mapping details** pane, enter `RATED` into the Relationship *Type* text box and select `ratings.csv` from the *File* dropdown.

=== 2. Define the From and To columns

In the table below, you must select the columns in the CSV file that identify the nodes at the start and end of each relationship.

Select `userId` as the *From* column, and `movieId` as the *To* column.
// TODO: Screenshot


=== 3. Define the Relationship Properties

The `ratings.csv` file contains two properties that should be attributed to this relationship, `rating` and `timestamp`.

In the **Definition** tab, click the **Select from file** to open the **Select from file** dialog.
Select the `rating` and `timestamp` columns and click **Confirm**.


=== 4. Update the rating data type

The `rating` property has been interpreted as a `float`, when infact it should be an `integer`.  Use the icon:PencilIcon[] icon to update the data type to `integer`.


=== Verifying this Step

You should now be able to see that:

* A **RATED** relationship has been defined from the **User** node to the **Movie** node.
* The **RATED** relationship should be a solid line.
* In the files pane, each column listed under `ratings.csv` should have a green indicator next to it.

**Great work!**  The data model is now complete.
In the next step, you will run the import and verify the results.



== Step 7: Running the import

Now that your data model is complete, you can import the data into your Sandbox.


Click the button:Run Import[role="ndl-btn filled medium"] button to import the Data into your Neo4j Sandbox instance.
// TODO: Run import from the button

Once complete, a model window will appear with a summary of the import.
You can use this window to show the Cypher statements that have been run in the background.


[TIP]
.Downloading your Data Model
====
To save the data model, you can open the context menu using the icon:DotsHorizontalIcon[] menu and select *Download model*.
The *Download model (with data)* option will also include the CSV files used to create the data model.

You can use the *Open model* option in the same menu to open your downloaded data model.
====

=== Verifying the import

You can run the following Cypher statement in the **Query** tab to verify that the result are correct.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.nodeTypeProperties() YIELD nodeType, propertyName, propertyTypes
WITH apoc.map.fromPairs(collect([nodeType +'.'+ propertyName, propertyTypes])) AS nodeProperties

UNWIND [
  {condition: 'Person.tmdbId should be a number', nodeType: ':`Person`', propertyName: "tmdbId", expected: ["Long"] }
] AS row

WITH row, nodeProperties[ row.nodeType +'.'+ row.propertyName ] AS actual


RETURN row.condition AS condition, row.expected AS expected, actual, CASE WHEN row.expected THEN '✅' ELSE '❌' END as OK
