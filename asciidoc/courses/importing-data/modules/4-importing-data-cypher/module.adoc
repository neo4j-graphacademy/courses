= Importing CSV Data with Cypher


[.transcript]
== Module Overview

Thus far you have used the Neo4j Data Importer to import CSV data into the graph.
Because the Data Importer creates all properties as strings, integers, floats, datetimes, or booleans, you needed to write Cypher code to transform property values and refactor the graph so that it matches the data madel you wanted to achieve.

The Data Importer is good for small to medium datasets(less than 1M rows), but if you have a large dataset, you will need to use Cypher to import the data.

In this module, you will learn about:

* When you must use Cypher to load data.
* Loading a large CSV file with Cypher.
