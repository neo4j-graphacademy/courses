== Movie data model

In the course, link:/courses/modeling-fundamentals/[Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals^], you learned that the stakeholders of your application must agree upon the important use cases for the application and design the graph data model to optimize the key queries of the application.

For this course we will use this already-designed graph data model:

image::{repository-raw}/{path}/images/movie-data-model-import-csv.png[Movie Data Model,width=600,align=center]

Here we see the node labels that will be created:

* Person
* Actor
* Director
* Movie
* Genre
* User

And we have the relationships:

* ACTED_IN (with a role property)
* DIRECTED (with role property)
* RATED (with rating  and timestamp properties)
* IN_GENRE

Also notice that the nodes have a number of properties, along with the type of data that will be used for each property.
It is important that you adhere to the property types defined in the data model.

Each node with a given label has a property that uniquely identifies the node.

* Movie nodes use  _movieId_.
* Person nodes use _tmdbId_.
* User nodes use _userId_.
* Genre nodes use _name_.

In the next module, you will be loading data into an empty graph from the CSV files to conform to this data model.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the already-designed graph data model you will use for loading the CSV data in this course.
In the next module, you will learn how to import CSV data with the Neo4j Data Importer.
