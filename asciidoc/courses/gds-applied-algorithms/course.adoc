== Course Description

This course demonstrates how to apply GDS algorithms to solve real-world industry problems.

You've learned the fundamentals of graph projections, algorithm execution, and configuration in the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/gds-fundamentals/[Getting Started with GDS^] course.
Now you'll see these techniques solve actual challenges across manufacturing, fraud detection, logistics, research, and machine learning.

Each module focuses on a different industry use case, showing not just *how* to run algorithms, but *when* and *why* professionals choose specific approaches.
You'll work with realistic datasets, implement complete analytical workflows, and understand the business reasoning behind each technique.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to design and implement graph-based solutions for complex industry problems.

The course automatically creates a new `movie recommendations` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.


== Prerequisites

This course is intended for analysts and data scientists who have:

* Completed link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/gds-fundamentals/[Getting Started with GDS^] or equivalent experience
* Understanding of graph projections (monopartite, bipartite, multipartite)
* Familiarity with algorithm execution modes (stream, write, mutate)
* Basic knowledge of algorithm configuration (orientation, weights)


== Duration

4-5 hours


== What you will learn

* **Manufacturing optimization:** Use centrality and community detection for root cause analysis in production systems
* **Fraud detection:** Build network-based fraud identification systems using graph patterns
* **Supply chain logistics:** Optimize routes and logistics with pathfinding algorithms
* **Citation networks:** Map research influence and identify key papers using centrality measures
* **Node embeddings:** Create structural representations for machine learning pipelines
