= Course summary

Congratulations on completing **Applied Algorithms in GDS**!

You've learned how to apply graph algorithms to solve real-world industry problems across manufacturing, fraud detection, logistics, research, and machine learning.


== What you've learned

In this course, you learned:

* **Manufacturing root cause analysis:** How to use centrality algorithms (Degree, Betweenness, PageRank) and community detection to identify failure sources in production systems

* **Network-based fraud detection:** How to build fraud detection systems using connected components, community detection, and centrality measures to identify coordinated fraudulent activity

* **Supply chain optimization:** How to apply pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, Yen's K) to optimize logistics routes and identify critical infrastructure points

* **Citation network analysis:** How to map research influence using PageRank, identify research communities with Louvain/Leiden, and find bridge papers with betweenness centrality

* **Node embeddings for ML:** How to generate structural representations using FastRP and GraphSAGE for downstream machine learning tasks


== The skills you have

You can now:

- Analyze complex systems using graph centrality to identify critical nodes
