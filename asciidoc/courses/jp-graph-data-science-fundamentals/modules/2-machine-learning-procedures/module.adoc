= Graph Machine Learning


== Module Overview

In the previous modules you learned about graph projection management and graph data science algorithms in GDS. In this module, you will learn about GDS native machine learning operations, including

* Graph Machine Learning Patterns
* Pipeline Objects in GDS and how to Manage Them
* Node Classification
* Link Prediction
