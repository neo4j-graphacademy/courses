== Course Description

In this course, you will learn how Neo4j and Knowledge Graphs can help you make work with Generative AI (GenAI) applications.

You will learn why graph databases are a reliable option for grounding GenAI models, using Neo4j to provide factual, reliable information to stop the LLM from giving false information, also known as *hallucination*.

You will learn about: 

. Embeddings and vector indexes, how they are used in GenAI, and how to use them in Neo4j.
. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and how GraphRAG builds on it to provide a graph-based approach to grounding LLMs.
. How to use the Neo4j GraphRAG python library to interact with AI models and Neo4j.

This course focuses on models from link:https://openai.com/[OpenAI^], although you can use the model and supplier of your choice.

=== Prerequisites

Before taking this course, you should have:

* A basic understanding of Graph Databases and Neo4j
* Knowledge of Python and capable of reading simple programs

We recommend taking the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^] course.

Although not essential, you may also benefit from taking the link:/courses/drivers-python/[Using Neo4j with Python^] course to understand how the Neo4j Python Driver works.

To complete the practical tasks within this course, you will need an link:https://platform.openai.com[OpenAI billing account and API key^].
