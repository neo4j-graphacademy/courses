= Constructing Knowledge Graphs: Structured vs Unstructured Data

What is a key difference between constructing knowledge graphs from structured data versus unstructured data?

* [x] Structured data can be directly mapped to nodes and relationships, while unstructured data requires extraction of entities and relationships using technologies like LLMs.
* [ ] Unstructured data is always easier to import into a graph database than structured data.
* [ ] Structured data cannot be used to create knowledge graphs.
* [ ] Both structured and unstructured data require the same processing steps.

.Hint
====
The process for constructing knowledge graphs from structured data is often more straightforward than from unstructured sources. Structured data is already organized, making it easier to map nodes, relationships, and attributes directly into a graph.

.Solution
====
The correct answer is:

* Structured data can be directly mapped to nodes and relationships, while unstructured data requires extraction of entities and relationships using technologies like LLMs.

Structured data is already organized, making it easier to import into a graph, while unstructured data needs to be processed to identify and extract the relevant entities and relationships.
