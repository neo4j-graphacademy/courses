== Unstructured data

Creating knowledge graphs from unstructured data can be complex, involving multiple steps of data query, cleanse, and transform.

You can use the text analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to help automate knowledge graph creation.

During this course, you will learn how to use LLMs to create knowledge graphs in Neo4j.

[TIP]

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about how you can create knowledge graphs.

You can learn more in the Neo4j blog post link:https://neo4j.com/blog/what-is-knowledge-graph[What Is a Knowledge Graph?^].

In the next module, you will use the Python and the `neo4j-graphrag` package to explore GraphRAG techniques.
