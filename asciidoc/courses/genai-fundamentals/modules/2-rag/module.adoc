:order: 2

== Module Overview

In this module, you will learn:

* What Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is and how you can use it to improve GenerativeAI model responses.
* How vectors and embeddings work, and how they can be used in RAG to find relevant information.
* How to use a vector indexes in Neo4j and when they are useful for finding context for Generative AI applications.
* About GraphRAG techniques, and how they can be used to enhance information retrieval.
