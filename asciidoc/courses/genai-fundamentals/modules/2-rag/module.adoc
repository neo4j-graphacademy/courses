= Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
:order: 2

== Module Overview

In this module, you will learn:

* What Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is and how it combines understanding user queries, retrieving relevant information, and generating responses using that information.
* How vectors and embeddings work, and how they can be used in RAG to find relevant information.
* How to use a vector index in Neo4j and when vector indexes are useful for finding context for Generative AI applications.
* What GraphRAG techniques are, and how they can be used to enhance information retrieval by combining vector search with graph traversal and relationships.
