== Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that enhances the responses of LLMs by providing them with relevant, up-to-date information retrieved from external sources. 

RAG helps generate more accurate and tailored answers, especially when the required information is not present in the model’s training data.

== The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Process

[.col]
====
The RAG process typically involves three main steps:

. **Understanding the User Query**
+
The system first interprets the user’s input or question to determine what information is needed.
. **Information Retrieval** 
+ 
A _retriever_ searches external data sources (such as documents, databases, or knowledge graphs) to find relevant information based on the user’s query.
. **Response Generation** 
+ 
The retrieved information is inserted into the prompt, and the language model uses this context to generate a more accurate and relevant response.

== The RAG Process

[.col]
====
RAG systems can provide responses that are both contextually aware and grounded in real, up-to-date information.

If building a chatbot for a news agency, you could use RAG to pull real-time headlines or results from a news API. 

When a user asks, "What’s the latest news on the Olympics?", the chatbot, can provide a current headline or summary from the most recent articles, ensuring the response is timely and accurate.

.Grounding
=====
The process of providing context to an LLM to improve the accuracy of its responses and reduce the likelihood of hallucinations is known as _Grounding_.

== Retrievers

The retriever is a key component of the RAG process. A retriever responsible for searching and retrieving relevant information from external data sources based on the user’s query.

A retriever typically takes an *unstructured input* (like a question or prompt) and searches for structured data that can provide context or answers.

Neo4j support various methods for building retrievers, including:

* Full-text search
* Vector search
* Text to Cypher

You will explore these methods in the rest of the course.

== Data sources

The data sources used in the RAG process can vary widely, depending on the application and the type of information needed. Common data sources include:

* **Documents**
+
Textual data sources, such as articles, reports, or manuals, that can be searched for relevant information.
* **APIs**
+ 
External services that can provide real-time data or specific information based on user queries.
* **Knowledge Graphs**
+
Graph-based representations of information that can provide context and relationships between entities.

== Data sources

[.col]
====
The news agency chatbot could use the following data sources:

* A news API to retrieve the latest articles or headlines. 
* A knowledge graph to understand the relationships between different news topics, such as how they relate to each other or their historical context. This would help the chatbot provide more in-depth and contextual responses.
* A document database to store and retrieve articles, reports, or other textual data that can be used to answer user queries.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about RAG, which combines understanding user queries, retrieving relevant information, and generating a response using the retrieved information.

In the next lesson, you will explore how embeddings and vector search can help retrieve relevant information.
