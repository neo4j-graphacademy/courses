What parameters does the `db.index.vector.queryNodes()` procedure require? (Select all that apply)

* [x] `indexName` - The name of the vector index to query
* [x] `numberOfNearestNeighbours` - The number of results to return
* [x] `query` - The embedding to compare against
* [ ] `token` - The OpenAI token to use for the query

.Solution
====
The `db.index.vector.queryNodes()` procedure requires these parameters?

* [x] indexName - The name of the vector index to query
