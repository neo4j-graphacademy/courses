= Integrating Neo4j with Generative AI
:order: 4

== Module Overview

In this module, you will setup and use the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/[Neo4j GraphRAG for Python package^] to:

* Create and configure a vector retriever.
* Perform semantic search using a vector index.
* Build a GraphRAG pipeline that uses retrievers to give context to an LLM.
* Use graph traversal in combination with vector search for enhanced retrieval.
* Implement text-to-Cypher retrieval for natural language querying.

In addition, you will explore popular GenAI frameworks for integrating with Neo4j, such as LangChain and LlamaIndex.


If you are ready, let's get going!
