.Solution
====
The correct answers are:

* Embedding model integration
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows
* Agentic workflows and orchestration

GenAI frameworks are designed to help you manage LLMs, embeddings, and workflows, and integrate with other technologies such as LLMs and databases. 
They do *not* typically provide their own data storage or query language.
