== Frameworks

[.col]
====
A variety of open-source and community-supported frameworks are available to help you integrate Neo4j with generative AI and large language models (LLMs).

These frameworks support use cases such as:

* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
* Agentic workflows.
* Knowledge graph construction.
====

[.col]
====
Typically these frameworks include:

* LLM usage, prompt and output management.
* Embedding model integration .
* Vector and database integration (including Neo4j).
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows.
* Agentic workflows and orchestration.
* Monitoring, observability, and deployment tools.
