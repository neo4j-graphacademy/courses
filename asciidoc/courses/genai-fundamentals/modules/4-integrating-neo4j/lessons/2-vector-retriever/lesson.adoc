= Vector Retriever
:order: 2
:type: lesson
:branch: new-course

In this lesson, you will create a vector retriever to retrieve relevant data from Neo4j.

A retriever is a component that takes unstructured data (typically a users query) and retrieves relevant data.

You will create a vector retriever that find similar movies based on a movie plot. 
The retriever will use the `moviePlots` vector index you used to search for similar movies using Cypher.

To find similar movies using a retriever you need to:

. Connect to a Neo4j database
. Create an _embedder_ to convert users queries into vectors
. Create a _retriever_ that uses the `moviePlots` vector index
. Use the retriever to search for similar movies using the users query
. Parse the results

Open the `genai-fundamentals/vector_retriever.py` file and review the program:

[source,python]
.vector_retriever.py
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-fundamentals/vector_retriever.py[tag=**]
----

The programs includes the code to connect to the Neo4j database using the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/[Neo4j Python driver^].

[TIP]
You can learn more about the Neo4j Python driver in the Graph Academy link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/drivers-python/[Using Neo4j with Python^] course.

== Embedder

Create the embedder that will convert the users query into a vector:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-fundamentals/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=import-embedder]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-fundamentals/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=embedder]
----

[NOTE]
====
You must use the same embedding model as the one used to create the movie plots embeddings, `text-embedding-ada-002`, to ensure the vectors are compatible.

The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/api.html#embedder[`neo4j-graphrag` package supports multiple embeddings models^] and the ability to create your own interface.

== Retriever

Create the retriever that will use the `moviePlots` vector index:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-fundamentals/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=import-retriever]

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-fundamentals/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=retriever]
----

The retriever allows you to specify what properties to return from the nodes that match the query.

== Search

You can use the retriever to search the vector index by passing a query and the number of results to return.
The retriever will use the embedder to convert the query into a vector to use in the search.

Search for similar movies:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-fundamentals/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=search]
----

The `search` method returns a list of `items` that match the query.

Iterate over the items and print the results:

[source,python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/genai-fundamentals/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=print-results]
----

Run the program to search for similar movies based on a query.

You should see movie `titles`, `plots`, and the similarity `score` for the times found.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create a vector retriever using the `neo4j-graphrag` package.

In the next module, you will build this retriever into a simple RAG pipeline that will use an LLM to answer questions using the retrieved data.
