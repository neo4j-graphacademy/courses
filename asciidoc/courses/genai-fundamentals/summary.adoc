= Course Summary

Congratulations on completing "Neo4j & GenAI Fundamentals". 

You have started your journey into understanding how Generative AI and Neo4j can work together.

You have learned:

* The fundamentals of Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and their limitations.
* How providing context improves the accuracy of Generative AI responses.
* About Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and how it combines retrieval and generation for better answers.
* How vectors and embeddings enable semantic search and contextual retrieval in Neo4j.
* Practical skills in building and querying knowledge graphs from both unstructured and structured data.
* How to use the Neo4j GraphRAG for Python package to integrate vector search, graph traversal, and natural language querying for enhanced AI applications.
