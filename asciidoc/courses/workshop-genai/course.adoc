Welcome to GraphAcademy and the Neo4j and Generative AI workshop.

== Description

In this workshop you will:

* Learn about Generative AI, RAG, and GraphRAG.
* Build a knowledge graph from unstructured and structured data.
* Use Vector indexes and embeddings in Neo4j to perform similarity search.
* Create vector, vector + cypher, and text to Cypher retrievers.
* Build a conversational agent using Neo4j, Python, and LangChain


=== Prerequisites

Before taking this workshop, you should have:

* A basic understanding of Graph Databases and Neo4j
* Able to read and understand basic Cypher queries
* Knowledge of Python and capable of reading and executing simple programs
