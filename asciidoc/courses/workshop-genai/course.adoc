Welcome to GraphAcademy and the Neo4j and Generative AI workshop.

In this workshop you will:

* Learn about Generative AI, RAG, and GraphRAG.
* Use Vector indexes and embeddings in Neo4j to perform similarity search.
* Create vector, vector + cypher, and text to Cypher retrievers.
* Build an agent using Neo4j, Python, and LangChain.

== What you will learn

* The basics of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
* What Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is and why it is important
* How GraphRAG can improve the quality of LLM-generated content
* How to use Vectors in Neo4j for similarity search
* To build different types of retrievers using the `neo4j-graphrag` for Python package.
* To create a simple agent using Neo4j, Python, and LangChain.

=== Prerequisites

Before taking this workshop, you should have:

* A basic understanding of Graph Databases and Neo4j
* Able to read and understand basic Cypher queries
* Knowledge of Python and capable of reading simple programs

We recommend taking the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^] course.
