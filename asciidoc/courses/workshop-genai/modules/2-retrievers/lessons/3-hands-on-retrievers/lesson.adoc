= Hands-On: Working with Retrievers
:type: challenge
:order: 3

In this lesson, you will work hands-on with all three retriever types using a Jupyter notebook to see how they work in practice.

[.slide]
== Hands-On: Retriever Notebook

Open the notebook: `03_Retrievers_notebook.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates:

1. **Setting up retrievers** with the knowledge graph we built
2. **Vector retrieval** for semantic search
3. **Hybrid retrieval** combining vectors and graph traversal  
4. **Text2Cypher** for structured queries
5. **Comparing results** from different retrieval methods

[.slide]
== What You'll Build

**Initialize Models:**
```python
from neo4j_graphrag.retrievers import VectorRetriever, VectorCypherRetriever, Text2CypherRetriever

llm = OpenAILLM(model_name="gpt-4o", api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
```

**Vector Retriever:**
```python
vector_retriever = VectorRetriever(
    driver=driver,
    index_name="chunkEmbeddings", 
    embedder=embedder
)
```

**Vector + Cypher Retriever:**
```python
vector_cypher_retriever = VectorCypherRetriever(
    driver=driver,
    index_name="chunkEmbeddings",
    retrieval_query=cypher_query,
    embedder=embedder
)
```

**Text2Cypher Retriever:**
```python
text2cypher_retriever = Text2CypherRetriever(
    driver=driver,
    llm=llm,
    neo4j_schema=neo4j_schema
)
```

[.slide]
== Testing Different Retrievers

**Try these questions with each retriever:**

**Broad Semantic Questions:**
- _"What are the main cybersecurity threats in financial services?"_
- _"Tell me about risk factors mentioned in the documents"_

**Entity-Specific Questions:**
- _"What products does Apple mention in their filings?"_
- _"Which companies face regulatory challenges?"_

**Precise Data Questions:**
- _"How many companies mention cloud computing?"_
- _"Count the risk factors for Microsoft"_

**Compare the results** - you'll see how each retriever approaches the same question differently!

[.slide]
== Workshop Approach

**For this workshop:**
- We'll use the pre-built knowledge graph from the previous lessons
- Walk through each retriever type with examples
- Compare their strengths and use cases
- See how they provide different perspectives on the same data

This hands-on experience prepares you for building agents that can intelligently choose and combine these retrieval methods.

[.slide]
== Key Observations

**As you work through the notebook, notice:**

**Vector Retriever:**
- Returns semantically similar text chunks
- Good for exploratory questions
- May miss entity-specific context

**Vector + Cypher:**
- Provides both content and relationships
- Richer context with entity information
- Better for comprehensive answers

**Text2Cypher:**
- Direct, precise answers from graph structure
- Perfect for factual queries
- Handles aggregations and counts

Each retriever has its place in a complete GraphRAG system!

== Summary

In this hands-on lesson, you worked with all three retriever types in practice:

**What You Built:**
- Vector Retriever for semantic search
- Vector + Cypher Retriever for contextual search
- Text2Cypher Retriever for precise queries

**Key Insights:**
- Different retrievers excel at different question types
- Combining approaches gives comprehensive coverage
- Understanding retriever strengths guides selection

**Preparation:**
- You now understand how each retriever works in practice
- You've seen their different strengths and limitations
- You're ready to wrap these retrievers as conversational agent tools

In the next module, you will learn how to combine these retrievers into intelligent agents that can choose the right retrieval method automatically.
