= Agent with Vector Retriever Tool
:type: lesson
:order: 2
:slides: true

Now you'll build your first agent by wrapping the **Vector Retriever** as a conversational tool.

[.slide]
== From Vector Retriever to Agent Tool

**What you learned in Module 2:**
```python
# Vector Retriever for semantic search
vector_retriever = VectorRetriever(
    driver=driver,
    index_name='chunkEmbeddings',
    embedder=embedder
)
```

**Now we wrap it as an agent tool:**
```python
# Convert to agent tool
vector_tool = Tool.from_function(
    name="Semantic Search",
    description="Search documents for similar content based on meaning",
    func=vector_retriever.search
)
```

[.slide]
== Building the Agent

Open the notebook for this lesson and you'll see how to:

1. **Set up the Vector Retriever** (same as Module 2)
2. **Wrap it as a tool** for agent use
3. **Create a LangChain ReAct agent** with the tool
4. **Have conversations** using semantic search

**Key insight:** The Vector Retriever does the work - the agent makes it conversational.

[.slide]
== Agent Conversation Flow

**When you ask: _"What cybersecurity threats are mentioned in the documents?"_**

1. **Agent receives** your natural language question
2. **Agent decides** to use the Semantic Search tool
3. **Tool calls** the Vector Retriever with your question
4. **Vector Retriever** finds semantically similar document chunks
5. **Agent formats** the results into a conversational response

**You get semantic search through natural conversation!**

[.slide]
== Hands-On: Vector Agent

**Try these questions with your agent:**

- _"What are the main risk factors mentioned in the documents?"_
- _"Tell me about cybersecurity threats in financial services"_
- _"What regulatory challenges do companies face?"_

**Notice:** All responses come from **semantic search** - the agent finds relevant content based on meaning, not exact keywords.

**Limitations:** This agent only has semantic search - it can't traverse relationships or do precise queries. That's what we'll add next!

== What You'll Learn

**This lesson shows:**
- How to wrap Vector Retriever as an agent tool
- Basic LangChain agent setup with one tool
- Natural language interface to semantic search
- Agent conversation flow and tool calling

**Next lesson:** Add Vector + Cypher Retriever for contextual relationships.

== Summary

In this lesson, you built your first agent by wrapping the Vector Retriever as a conversational tool:

**Key Concepts:**
- **Tool wrapping:** Vector Retriever → Semantic Search Tool
- **Agent setup:** LangChain ReAct agent with one tool
- **Conversation flow:** Natural language → tool selection → retriever execution → formatted response

**What You Built:**
- Agent that can answer questions using semantic search
- Conversational interface to the Vector Retriever from Module 2
- Foundation for adding more retriever tools

**Limitations:**
- Only semantic search (no relationship traversal)
- No precise queries or aggregations
- Single tool agent

In the next lesson, you will enhance your agent by adding the Vector + Cypher Retriever tool for contextual relationships and richer answers.
