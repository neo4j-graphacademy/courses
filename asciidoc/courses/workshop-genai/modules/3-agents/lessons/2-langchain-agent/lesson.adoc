== Introduction
In this lesson, you'll build your first LangChain agent that can interact with your Neo4j knowledge graph.

**Key insight:** The agent chooses which tool to use based on your question.

**When you ask: _"Summarize the schema of the graph database"_**

1. **Agent receives** your natural language question
2. **Agent decides** to use the `Get-graph-database-schema` tool
3. **Tool executes** and returns the Neo4j schema
4. **Agent processes** the schema and creates a summary
5. **Agent responds** in natural language

[.slide]
== What You'll Build

Open the notebook: `02_01_simple_agent.ipynb`

**This agent:**

- Uses LangChain and LangGraph for agent functionality
- Connects to your Neo4j database
- Has a single tool: `Get-graph-database-schema`
- Can answer questions about your graph structure

**The goal:** Understand basic agent architecture before adding retriever capabilities.

== Agent Architecture

```python
# 1. Initialize LLM
model = init_chat_model("gpt-4o", model_provider="openai")

# 2. Connect to Neo4j
graph = Neo4jGraph(url=NEO4J_URI, username=username, password=password)

# 3. Define tools
@tool("Get-graph-database-schema")
def get_schema():
    """Get the schema of the graph database."""
    return graph.schema

# 4. Create agent
agent = create_react_agent(model, tools)
```

== Try These Questions

**Schema exploration:**

- _"Summarize the schema of the graph database"_
- _"How are Products related to other entities?"_
- _"What questions can I answer using this graph database?"_

**Perfect for understanding data structure before building queries!**

== Summary

In this lesson, you built your first agent with schema introspection capabilities:

**Key Concepts:**

- **Schema tool:** Database structure exploration through conversation
- **Agent setup:** LangChain ReAct agent with introspection tool
- **LangGraph:** Modern agent framework for tool orchestration
- **Graph structure:** Understanding nodes, relationships, and properties

**Next lesson:** Add Vector Retriever tool for semantic content search.

- **Conversation flow:** Natural language → tool selection → retriever execution → formatted response

**What You Built:**

- Agent that can answer questions using semantic search
- Conversational interface to graph database schema
- Foundation for adding more retriever tools

**Limitations:**

- Only semantic search (no relationship traversal)
- No precise queries or aggregations
- Single tool agent

In the next lesson, you will enhance your agent by adding the Vector + Cypher Retriever tool for contextual relationships and richer answers.
