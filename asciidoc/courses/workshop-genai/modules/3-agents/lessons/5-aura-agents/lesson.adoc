== No-code Agents

The approach used so far in this module has involved writing code to create agents using Python and LangChain.

**Neo4j Aura** also provides a **no-code interface** to create agents that demonstrate GraphRAG through **Aura Agents**.


[.slide.discrete]
== What are Aura Agents?

The key features of Aura Agents are:

* **No-code creation** - Build agents through a web interface
* **GraphRAG integration** - Leverage your knowledge graph structure
* **Multiple tool types** - Combine different query approaches
* **API accessibility** - Make agents available via REST endpoints


[.slide.col-2]
== Creating an Agent 

[.col]
====
To create an agent, select **Agent** from the left hand menu and click **Create**.
You can configure your agent with a:

* **Name** - A clear, descriptive name for the agent
* **Description** - A brief explanation of the agent's purpose
* **Prompt Instructions** - Instructions passed to the LLM to provide context for the agent and how it should behave 
* **Target instance** - The Neo4j Aura instance that the agent will connect to  
* **Visibility** - The agent can be made available internally for members of the Aura project, or available externally via an API endpoint.

**Setting up our EDGAR SEC Filings agent:** 

* **Name:**  [copy]#EDGAR SEC Filings Agent#

* **Description:** 

[source]
An agent that can answer questions about the EDGAR SEC filings.

* **Prompt Instructions:** 

[source]
You are an expert in the EDGAR SEC filings. You have access to a graph database containing information about companies, executives, financial metrics, and business risks extracted from the EDGAR SEC filings.

* **Target instance:**  _Select Your instance_ 

* **Visibility:**  [copy]#Internal#

[.slide]
== Agent Tool Types

Aura Agents support three different tool types:

* **Similarity Search Tools** - Vector-based semantic search
* **Cypher Template Tools** - Predefined queries with parameters
* **Text-to-Cypher Tools** - Natural language to Cypher translation  

These tools are used to provide an LLM with the context required to perform the task at hand.


[.slide.col-2]
== Similarity Search Tools

[.col]
====
**Purpose:** Find semantically similar content using vector embeddings.

**Best for:**

* Document search
* Content discovery
* Finding similar clauses or terms
* Semantic matching


**Example Query:** "What are the risks that Apple faces?"

====

[.col]
====

**Configuration:** 

* **Name:** [copy]#Risk Finder#
* **Description:** [copy]#Find companies that face a type of risk.#
* **Embedding Provider:** [copy]#OpenAI#
* **Embedding Model:** [copy]#text-embedding-ada-002#
* **Index:** [copy]#chunkEmbeddings#
* **Top K:** [copy]#10#



====



[.slide.col-2]
== Cypher Template Tools

[.col]
====
**Purpose:** Execute predefined Cypher queries with user-provided parameters.

**Best for:**

* Common, repeated questions
* Deterministic results with consistent performance
* Complex queries using full Cypher feature set
* Well-defined business logic patterns

**Connection to Code:** These tools implement the same pattern as direct Cypher queries you've written, but packaged for reuse by the agent.

**Example Query:** "What companies are owned by **BlackRock Inc.**?"

====

[.col]
====

**Configuration:** 

* **Name:** [copy]#Get holdings for Asset Manager#
* **Description:** [copy]#Find all companies owned by a asset manager by their name.#
* **Parameters:** 
** [copy]#asset_manager#, a string - [copy]#The full name of the asset manager.#
* **Cypher Template:** 
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (owner:AssetManager {managerName: $asset_manager}) 
RETURN owner.managerName AS managerName, 
    [ (owner)-[:OWNS]->(company) | company.name] AS owned_companies
----

====

[.slide.col-2]
== Text-to-Cypher Tools

[.col]
====
**Purpose:** Convert natural language questions into Cypher queries dynamically.

**Best for:**

* Catch-all for unforseen questions
* Well-defined questions that map directly to the schema
* Ad-hoc analysis
* Questions you haven't created templates for


**Example Queries:** 

"Which documents mention the metric 'net loss'?" + 
"List the asset managers in ascending order of the number of companies they own shares in."

====

[.col]
====

**Configuration:** 

* **Name:** [copy]#Catch-all data tool#
* **Description:** 
[source]
A tool that can answer any question about the graph that cannot be specifically answered by the other tools.

====


[.slide]
== Testing the agent

Clicking an agent in the left hand pane will reveal a chat interface that you can use to test the agent.

You can test the tools in sequence.

1. [copy]#List the top 5 asset managers by name in ascending order.# - Text-to-Cypher tool
2. [copy]#Which companies does "ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN L.P." hold shares in?# - Cypher Template tool
3. [copy]#What are the risks that Apple faces?# - Similarity Search tool

The tool will choose the best tool for each question.

The UI will display the time taken to generate the final answer.  Expand the **Thought for...** section to view the steps and tool calls taken to generate the answer.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned about Neo4j Aura Agents and how to create no-code agents for your knowledge graph:

**Key Concepts:**

* **Aura Agents** are a no-code interface for creating GraphRAG-powered chatbots

**Tool Types:**

* **Cypher Template Tools** - Execute predefined queries for known patterns and specific lookups
* **Text-to-Cypher Tools** - Convert natural language to Cypher for flexible exploration
* **Similarity Search Tools** - Use vector embeddings for semantic content discovery
