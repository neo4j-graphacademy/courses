== Multi-tool Agent

You will modify the agent to add a _Text to Cypher_ retriever tool.

This will allow the agent to:

* Use the Cypher query language to access the Neo4j database.
* Retrieve more specific information such as facts and figures.
* Find data in documents using the vector index.
* Use multiple tools to answer complex questions.

== Adding the retriever

Open the `workshop-genai/02_03_text2cypher_agent.ipynb` notebook.

You will need to:

. Add a model to generate Cypher queries
. Create a prompt for the model
. Use the Cypher QA chain to create a _query database_ tool
. Create an agent that uses all the tools

[.slide]
== Experiment

Depending on the question asked the agent will use different tools to respond to the question.

Try asking questions about the documents and the graph schema, for example:

* What stock has microsoft issued?
* How does the graph model relate to financial documents and risk factors?
* What are the top risk factors that Apple faces?
* Summarize what risk factors are mentioned in Apple's financial documents?
* How many risk factors does Apple face and what are the top ones?
