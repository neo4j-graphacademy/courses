== The Final Tool

You will complete your agent by adding a Text2Cypher query tool as the third tool.

**Your complete agent will now have:**
- **Tool 1:** Schema Tool (database structure exploration)
- **Tool 2:** Document Retrieval Tool (vector search + graph context)
- **Tool 3:** Database Query Tool (text-to-Cypher for precise queries) ← **NEW!**

This creates a comprehensive GraphRAG agent that can handle any type of question intelligently.

== When to Use Each Tool

**Schema Tool:**
- Understanding database structure
- _"What entities exist in the graph?"_

**Document Retrieval Tool:**
- Finding content with company context
- _"What products does Microsoft mention in its documents?"_

**Database Query Tool:**
- Precise queries and counts
- _"How many risk factors does Apple face?"_

The agent automatically chooses the best tool for each question type!
