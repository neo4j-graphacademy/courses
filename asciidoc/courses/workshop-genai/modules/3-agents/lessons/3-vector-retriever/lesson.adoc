:type: lesson
:order: 3

== Adding the Second Tool

You will enhance your agent from lesson 2 by adding the Vector + Cypher Retriever as a second tool.

**Your agent will now have:**
- **Semantic Search Tool:** Vector Retriever (from lesson 2)
- **Contextual Search Tool:** Vector + Cypher Retriever (new!)

The agent can now intelligently choose which tool to use based on the question type.

[.slide]
== When to Use Each Tool

**Vector Retriever (Tool 1):**
- Simple semantic search
- "What are the main risk factors?"
- "Tell me about cybersecurity threats"

**Vector + Cypher Retriever (Tool 2):**
- Context-aware search with relationships
- "What products does Microsoft mention in its risk documents?"
- "How are companies connected through their mentioned products?"

The agent decides automatically which tool is best for each question!

[.slide]
== Two-Tool Agent

Open the notebook to see how we add the Vector + Cypher Retriever as a second tool:

1. **Keep existing Vector tool** (from lesson 2)
2. **Add new Vector + Cypher tool** (retriever from Module 2)
3. **Let agent choose** between tools based on question

Now your agent can handle both simple semantic search AND contextual relationship queries.

[.slide]
== Hands-On: Two-Tool Agent

**Try these questions to see tool selection:**

**Semantic Search (Vector Tool):**
- _"What are the main risk factors mentioned in the documents?"_
- _"Tell me about cybersecurity threats in financial services"_

**Contextual Search (Vector + Cypher Tool):**
- _"What products does Microsoft mention in its financial documents?"_
- _"How are companies connected through their mentioned products?"_

**Notice:** The agent chooses the right tool automatically based on whether relationships are needed!
