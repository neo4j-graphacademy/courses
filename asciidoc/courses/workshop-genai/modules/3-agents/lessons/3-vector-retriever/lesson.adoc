== Agent retriever

You will modify the agent code to include a vector retriever tool to:

. Search the documents using the vector index
. Traverse the graph around the document to find other facts

[.slide]
== Adding the retriever

Open the `workshop-genai/02_02_vector_graph_agent.ipynp` notebook.

You will need to:

. Add an embedding model
. Create a retrieval query
. Use the `chunkEmbeddings` vector index
. Add a tool to retrieve documents
. Create the agent with the new tool 

.[.slide]
== Experiment

Ask different questions about the documents and the graph schema, for example:

* Summarize the schema of the graph database.
* What products does Microsoft referred to in its financial documents?
* What type of questions can I ask about Apple using the graph database?

[NOTE]
The agent will decide which tool to use based on the question asked.
