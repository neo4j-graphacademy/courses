== Explore the Data Model

Use Cypher query to find product data relating to `APPLE INC`:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Company)-[m:MENTIONS]->(product:Product)
WHERE c.name = 'APPLE INC'
RETURN c, m, product
----

== Building a Knowledge Graph

I used the `neo4j-graphrag` Python library to create the graph by:

. *Chunking the data* - The documents were broken down the data into manageable _chunks_.
. *_Vectorizing_ the chunks* - Embeddings were created to search the data.
. *Extracting entities and relationships* - The data was passed to an LLM to discover nodes and relationships.
. *Generating the graph* - The output was used to create the graph in Neo4j.
