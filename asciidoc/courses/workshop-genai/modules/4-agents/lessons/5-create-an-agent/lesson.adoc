. Create an agent using the example code from this workshop.
. Define a set of tools that the agent can use to answer user queries based on the knowledge graph, these could include:
** Cypher query tools that run Cypher queries against the graph and return the results
** Vector + Cypher retrievers to semantically search the knowledge graph.
** Text to Cypher tools to query specific data from the graph.
