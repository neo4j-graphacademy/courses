== Getting Started with the Driver

You now know how to:

* Install and set up the Neo4j Java Driver in your projects
* Create and manage driver instances properly
* Execute queries and work with results using `executableQuery()`
* Use parameters safely in your queries

== Working with Neo4j Data Types

You've mastered handling:

* Graph elements (Nodes, Relationships, and Paths)
* Date and time values with proper timezone handling
* Geographic locations using spatial types
* Converting between Neo4j and Java native types

== Production-Ready Applications

You've learned essential patterns for production use:

* Managing transactions effectively with sessions
* Implementing read and write operations correctly
* Using the unit of work pattern for related operations
* Handling errors and implementing retry logic

== Pro Tips

=== Driver Best Practices

* Create just one driver instance and share it across your application
* Always close your driver when shutting down
* Use Java's `try-with-resource` pattern for automatic cleanup

=== Performance Optimization

* Use parameters to improve query performance
* Mark read-only queries with `RoutingControl.READ`
* Use transaction functions for streaming large result sets
* Break up large operations into manageable transactions
