== Introduction

[.col]
====
You can use the `executableQuery()` method to create one-off Cypher statements that return a small number of records.

The `execute` method fetches a list of records and loads them into memory.

[source,Java]
----
final String cypher = """
    MATCH (p:Person {name: $name})-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
    RETURN m.title AS title, r.role AS role
    """;
final String name = "Tom Hanks";

var result = driver.executableQuery(cypher)
    .withParameters(Map.of("name", name))
    .execute();

You can use the `App.java` file throughout the course to experiment and run any code snippets.

. The `executableQuery` method expects a Cypher statement as a string as the first argument.
. Parameters can be passed as a map using the `withParameters()` method.
. The `execute()` method runs the query and returns the result.

[TIP]
.Using Parameters
======
It is good practice to use parameters in your queries to avoid malicious code being injected into your Cypher statement.

== Handling the Result

The `execute()` method returns an link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/java-driver/5.28/org.neo4j.driver/org/neo4j/driver/EagerResult.html[`EagerResult`^] object that contains:

. A list of link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/java-driver/5.28/org.neo4j.driver/org/neo4j/driver/Record.html[`Record`^] objects
. link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/java-driver/5.28/org.neo4j.driver/org/neo4j/driver/summary/ResultSummary.html[`ResultSummary`^] of the query execution
. A list of keys specified in the `RETURN` clause

[source,Java]
----
var records = result.records(); // <1>
var summary = result.summary(); // <2>
var keys = result.keys();       // <3>

System.out.println(records);
System.out.println(summary);
System.out.println(keys);
----

[.slide]
== Accessing results

Each row returned by the query is a `Record` object.  The `Record` object provides access to the data returned by the query.

You can access any item in the `RETURN` clause using the `get` method.

[source,Java]
----
// RETURN m.title AS title, r.role AS role
var records = result.records();
records.forEach(r -> {
    System.out.println(r.get("title"));
    System.out.println(r.get("role"));
});

== Reading and writing 

By default, `executableQuery()` runs in **WRITE** mode.  In a clustered environment, this sends all queries to the cluster leader, putting unnecessary load on the leader. 

When you're only reading data, you can optimize performance by configuring the query to `READ` mode. 
This distributes your read queries across all cluster members.

[source,Java]
----
import org.neo4j.driver.RoutingControl;

var result = driver.executableQuery(cypher)
    .withParameters(Map.of("name", name))
    .withConfig(QueryConfig.builder()
                .withRouting(RoutingControl.READ)
                .build())
    .execute();
