= Using the driver

== Introduction
In the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] course, you learned how to query Neo4j using Cypher.

To run Cypher statements in a Java application, you'll need the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/Java[Neo4j Java Driver^].
The driver acts as a bridge between your Java code and Neo4j, handling connections to the database and the execution of Cypher queries.

== Creating a Driver Instance

Open the `src/main/java/com/neo4j/app/App.java` file.

Import the driver: 

[source,Java]
----
import org.neo4j.driver.GraphDatabase;
import org.neo4j.driver.AuthTokens;
----

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== Creating a Driver Instance

[.col]
====
Create a `driver` instance in `main()`:

[source,Java]
----
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AppUtils.loadProperties();

        // Create a new Neo4j driver instance
        var driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
                System.getProperty("NEO4J_URI"), // <1>
                AuthTokens.basic(
                    System.getProperty("NEO4J_USERNAME"), // <2>
                    System.getProperty("NEO4J_PASSWORD")) 
            );
    }
}
----
====

[.col]
====
<1> The connection string for your Neo4j database
<2> Your Neo4j username and password


[TIP]
.Best Practice
=====
Create **one** Driver instance and share it across your entire application.
=====
====

[.slide]
== Verifying Connectivity

You can verify the connection by calling the `verifyConnectivity()` method.

[source,Java]
----
driver.verifyConnectivity();
----

[NOTE]
.Verify Connectivity
=====
The `verifyConnectivity()` method will raise an exception if the connection cannot be made.
=====

[.slide.col-2]
== Running Your First Query

[.col]
====
The `executableQuery()` method executes a Cypher query and returns the results.

[source,Java]
----
// <1>
var result = driver.executableQuery( 
    "RETURN COUNT {()} AS count"
    ).execute();

// Get the first record
var records = result.records(); // <2>
var first = records.get(0);

// Print the count entry
System.out.println(first.get("count"));   // <3>
----
====

[.col]
====
<1> `executableQuery()` runs a Cypher query to get the count of all nodes in the database
<2> `records()` returns a list of the records returned
<3> Keys from the `RETURN` clause are accessed using the `get` method
====

[.slide]
== Full driver lifecycle

Once you have finished with the driver, call `close()` to release any resources held by the driver.

[source,Java]
----
driver.close();
----

[.slide.discrete]
== Run the application

You can run the application to see the output:

[source, bash]
----
./mvnw compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.neo4j.app.App"
----

[TIP]
You can also run the application using the _play_ button in your IDE.

[.slide]
== Try with resources

You can use `try-with-resources` to automatically close the driver when the block is exited.

[source,Java]
----
try (
    var driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
        System.getProperty("NEO4J_URI"), 
        AuthTokens.basic(
            System.getProperty("NEO4J_USERNAME"), 
            System.getProperty("NEO4J_PASSWORD"))
    )
) {
    driver.verifyConnectivity();

    var result = driver.executableQuery(
        "RETURN COUNT {()} AS count"
        ).execute();
}
----

[.summary]
== Lesson Summary

In this lesson you learned how to install the Neo4j Java Driver, create a Driver instance, verify connectivity to your database, and execute your first Cypher statement.

For async applications, link:https://neo4j.com/docs/Java-manual/current/concurrency/[use the `AsyncGraphDatabase` method].

In the next lesson, you will take a quiz to test your knowledge of installing and creating a driver instance.
