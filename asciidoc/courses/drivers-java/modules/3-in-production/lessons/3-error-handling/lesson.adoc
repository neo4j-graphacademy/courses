== Error Handling

When working with Neo4j, you may encounter various database errors that need to be handled gracefully in your application. 
The driver exports a https://neo4j.com/docs/api/java-driver/5.28/org.neo4j.driver/org/neo4j/driver/exceptions/Neo4jException.html[`Neo4jException` class^] that is inherited by all exceptions thrown by the database.


=== Common exceptions 

* `AuthenticationException` - Raised when authentication fails (incorrect credentials provided)
* `ClientException` - Raised when the client-side error occurs
* `ConnectionReadTimeoutException` - Raised when the connection to the database times out (transaction took longer than timeout - 30 seconds, by default)
* `DatabaseException` - Raised when there is a problem with the database
* `GqlStatusErrorClassification` - Raises an error based on GQL status codes
* `RetryableException` - Indicates retrying the transaction may succeed
* `ServiceUnavailableException` - Raised when the database is unavailable (e.g., server is down or not running)
* `TransactionTerminatedException` - Indicates that a transaction was terminated for some reason

== Handling errors

When using the Neo4j Java driver, you can handle errors by catching specific exceptions.
Any errors raised by the DBMS (`Neo4jException`) will have a `message` property that describes the error, as well as optional properties for `code`, `gql_status`, `cause`, and more.

[source,java]
----
try (var session = driver.session()) {
    // Run a Cypher statement
    var result = session.run("MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 10;");
    result.forEachRemaining(record -> {
        System.out.println(record.get("n").asNode().asMap());
    });
} catch (Neo4jException e) {
    e.code(); // Outputs the error code
    e.getMessage(); // Outputs the error message
    e.gqlStatus(); // Outputs the GQL status
    e.printStackTrace(); // Outputs full stack trace
}
----

The `gqlStatus` property contains an error code that corresponds to an error in the ISO GQL standard. A full list of GQL error codes can be found in link:https://neo4j.com/docs/status-codes/current/errors/gql-errors/[Status Codes for Errors & Notifications^].

== Example: Handling unique constraint violations

[.col]
====
One common scenario is dealing with constraint violations when inserting data.
A unique constraint ensures that a property value is unique across all nodes with a specific label. 

The following Cypher statement creates a unique constraint named `unique_email` to ensure that the `email` property is unique for the `User` label:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT unique_email IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (u:User) REQUIRE u.email IS UNIQUE;
----

If a Cypher statement violates this constraint, Neo4j will raise a `ConstraintError`.

[.transcript-only]
=====
Here's an example of how to handle a unique constraint violation (pops as a `ClientException`) when creating a new user:
=====

[source,Java]
----
var name = "Test Name";
var email = "test@test.com";
        
try (var session = driver.session()) {
    var result = session.run("""
        CREATE (u:User {name: $name, email: $email})
        RETURN u;
    """, 
    Values.parameters("name", name, "email", email));
} catch (ClientException e) {
    e.printStackTrace(); 
    // org.neo4j.driver.exceptions.ClientException:
        // Node(5) already exists with label `User` 
        // and property `email` = 'test@test.com'
}

[.summary]
== Summary

Proper error handling is crucial for building robust Neo4j applications. By catching and handling specific exceptions:

* Your application can gracefully handle expected error conditions
* Users receive meaningful feedback
* You can implement appropriate recovery strategies
* Your application remains stable even when errors occur

[TIP]
.Best Practices
====
* Always catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic error
* Log errors appropriately for debugging
* Provide meaningful feedback to users
* Consider implementing retry logic for transient errors
