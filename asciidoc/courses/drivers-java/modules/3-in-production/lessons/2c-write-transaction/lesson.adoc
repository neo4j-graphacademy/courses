You have built an application that streams the results of a long-running Cypher statement to the client.

You have written a transaction function called `getCheapestFlights` to execute a **read** query within a transaction.

public static List<Record> getCheapestFlights(
    TransactionContext tx, 
    String date, 
    String origin, 
    String destination) {

    var result = tx.run("""
        MATCH (origin:Airport)<-[:ORIGIN]-(f:Flight)-[:DESTINATION]->(destination:Airport),
            (f)-[:OPERATED_BY]->(operator:Airline)
        WHERE origin.name = $origin AND destination.name = $destination AND f.date = $date
        RETURN f.price AS price, operator.name AS operator
        """, Map.of("date", date, "origin", origin, "destination", destination));

    return result.list();
}

== Summary

In this lesson, you demonstrated how to execute a read transaction using the `executeRead()` method.
The method handles transaction management automatically and allows for streaming results as they become available.

The `executeRead()` method is the recommended way to run read transactions as it:

* Automatically handles transaction management
* Enables streaming of results as they become available
* Ensures proper transaction lifecycle and resource cleanup

[TIP]
.Consuming results
====
Remember that the results must be consumed within the transaction function. 
Once the transaction is completed, the results are no longer available.
