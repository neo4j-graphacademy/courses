When reading data from Neo4j, use `executeRead()` to run a read transaction. This ensures that the transaction is properly managed and allows for streaming results back to the client.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is `executeRead()`.

`executeRead()` is the recommended method for running read transactions in Neo4j. 
The function handles transaction management automatically and allows for streaming results as they become available.
