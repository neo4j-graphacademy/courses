= Handling results
:order: 2

In the previous module, you learned how to install the driver, connect to an instance, and run your first query.

In this module, you will learn how to handle the results of a query. The Neo4j Java Driver returns data in various formats, and understanding how to work with these types is essential for building robust applications.

You will learn about:

* Working with graph types (Nodes, Relationships, and Paths)
* Handling temporal types (dates and times)
* Using spatial types (points and distances)
* Transforming query results into different formats

By the end of this module, you'll be able to work confidently with all the data types returned by Neo4j queries.
