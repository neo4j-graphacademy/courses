Congratulations on completing the "Introduction to GraphRAG" workshop!

In this 60-minute hands-on workshop, you've learned how GraphRAG combines graph databases with generative AI to enhance the quality of LLM-generated content. You've explored how GraphRAG addresses limitations of traditional vector-based RAG by providing additional context through graph relationships and structured data.


== Understanding GraphRAG Fundamentals

You now understand how to:

* **Distinguish between traditional RAG and GraphRAG** - Recognize when vector-based RAG falls short and how knowledge graphs provide structured context
* **Identify GraphRAG use cases** - Understand when to use GraphRAG for highly specific queries, exact data retrieval, and complex relationship analysis
* **Work with graph concepts** - Apply knowledge of nodes, relationships, and properties to represent business entities and their connections
* **Query graphs with Cypher** - Use Neo4j's query language to traverse relationships and extract meaningful insights from connected data


== Building Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data

You've learned how to:

* **Extract entities and relationships** - Transform unstructured PDF documents into structured business entities like companies, executives, products, and financial metrics
* **Design extraction schemas** - Define entity types and relationship patterns to guide AI-powered extraction from documents
* **Use the Neo4j GraphRAG Library** - Implement `SimpleKGPipeline` to automate the extraction and storage process
* **Create guided extraction prompts** - Write effective prompts that ensure quality and consistency in entity extraction
* **Combine structured and unstructured data** - Enhance extracted entities with additional data from CSV files and structured sources
* **Validate extraction quality** - Use Cypher queries to verify that entities and relationships were correctly identified and stored


== Working with GraphRAG Retrievers

You've mastered how to:

* **Choose the right retriever type** - Select between Vector, Vector + Cypher, and Text2Cypher retrievers based on query requirements
* **Implement Vector Retriever** - Use semantic similarity search to find conceptually related content across documents
* **Build Vector + Cypher Retriever** - Combine semantic search with graph traversal to retrieve both content and relationship context
* **Create Text2Cypher Retriever** - Convert natural language questions into Cypher queries for precise, structured data retrieval
* **Optimize retriever performance** - Understand when each approach works best and how to avoid common pitfalls
* **Handle different query types** - Apply appropriate retriever strategies for broad exploratory questions versus specific factual queries


== Integrating with LangGraph and AI Agents

You now know how to:

* **Connect Neo4j with LangGraph** - Use prebuilt ReAct agents to enable AI applications to interact with graph databases
* **Use the langchain-neo4j library** - Integrate Neo4j functionality into LangChain-based applications
* **Build GraphRAG applications** - Create end-to-end systems that leverage both vector embeddings and graph relationships
* **Work with real-world data** - Apply GraphRAG techniques to financial documents, SEC filings, and business intelligence use cases


== Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

You've explored how to:

* **Enhance development workflows** - Use AI-powered tools to interact with Neo4j databases using natural language
* **Query databases conversationally** - Generate Cypher queries from natural language descriptions
* **Explore graph schemas** - Use AI assistance to understand and navigate complex graph structures
* **Build with AI assistance** - Leverage MCP tools in IDEs like GitHub Copilot for seamless AI-assisted coding with Neo4j


== Pro Tips

=== Performance Optimization

* **Vector Index Management:** Ensure your vector embeddings are properly indexed for fast similarity search
* **Query Optimization:** Use specific entity filters before expensive graph traversals to improve retriever performance
* **Chunk Size Tuning:** Experiment with different text chunk sizes to balance context richness with search precision

=== Schema Design Best Practices

* **Entity Resolution:** Use guided prompts to resolve generic references like "the Company" to actual entity names
* **Relationship Validation:** Implement strict schema enforcement to ensure extracted relationships follow your defined patterns
* **Quality Control:** Regularly validate extraction results with sample queries to maintain data quality

=== Production Considerations

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for extraction pipelines to handle malformed or unexpected document formats
* **Incremental Updates:** Design your extraction process to handle new documents without reprocessing the entire corpus
* **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for extraction quality and retriever performance in production environments
