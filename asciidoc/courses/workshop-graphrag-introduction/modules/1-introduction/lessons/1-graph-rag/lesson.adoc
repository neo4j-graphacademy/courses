== Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that improves the responses of LLMs by providing them with relevant, up-to-date information retrieved from external sources.

== Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vectors

This typically involves converting text into **vector embeddings** that encodes the semantic meaning of the text, in a format that the user understands, and then using similarity search to find relevant information.

**Vectors work well for:**

* Contextual or Meaning Based Questions
* Synonyms or Paraphrasing
* Fuzzy or Vague queries
* Broad or Open-Ended questions
* Complex queries with multiple concepts

**Vectors are ineffective for:**

* Highly Specific or Fact-Based Questions
* Numerical or Exact-Match Queries
* Boolean or Logical Queries
* Ambiguous or Unclear Queries without Context
* Specialised Knowledge

== GraphRAG

GraphRAG involves creating a **knowledge graph** of nodes and relationships contained in unstructured data.

[.slide.col-2]
== Nodes

[.col]
====
* Nodes represent **things**
* Nodes are grouped by **labels**
* Nodes are described by **properties** as key-value pairs
