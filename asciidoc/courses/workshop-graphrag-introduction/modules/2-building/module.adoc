= Building Knowledge Graphs
:order: 2

There are several ways to build a knowledge graph, and the method you choose will depend on the data you have and the requirements of your application.  Your starting point may be unstructured text, or you may have structured data in a database or available via an API.

In this module, we will explore how to build a knowledge graph from unstructured text using the Neo4j GraphRAG package.

This involves using an LLM to extract the entities and relationships from the text by defining the output contained within the data and using a structured output format to guide the LLM.

You will:

* Learn about data modeling for knowledge graphs
* Build a knowledge graph from unstructured text
* Use the Neo4j GraphRAG package for graph construction
