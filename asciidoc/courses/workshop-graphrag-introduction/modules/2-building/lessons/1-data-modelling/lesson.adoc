== Graph Data Modelling

There is no data model within Neo4j until you create data within the database.

Neo4j is schema-optional - you create the data model as you create the data.

[.slide]
== The Golden Rule

The golden rule of graph data modeling is to model your data as a graph of nouns and verbs:

image::images/noun-verb-noun.svg["(Noun)-[:VERB]->(Noun)"]

[.slide.discrete]
== Noun VERB Noun

The nouns become nodes and the verbs become relationships:

image::images/person-purchased-product.svg["(Person)-[:PURCHASED]->(Product)"]

[.slide.discrete]
== Expanding Relationships

You can expand a relationship to include more detail:

image::images/person-placed-order.svg["(Person)-[:PLACED]->(Order)"]

[.slide.discrete]
== Describe the Data

The `(Noun)-[:VERB]->(Noun)` pattern allows you to describe your data in a way that is easy to understand.

[.slide]
== Properties

Nodes & relationships with the same label or type can have different properties.

[.slide]
== Labels

Node labels serve as an anchor point for a query.

====
By specifying a label, you are specifying a subset of one or more nodes with which to start a query.
====

[.slide.discrete]
== Multiple Labels

You can segment your graph by using multiple labels on nodes:

[.transcript-only]
====
Labels allow you to target specific sub-sections of your graph.

[.slide]
== Node | Property

Depending on your use case, you may want to deduplicate properties into Nodes:

image::images/node-or-property-1.svg["A Movie node with a language property of 'English|'French'", width=90%]

[.slide.discrete]
== Node | Property

This model offers greater flexibility and improved query performance but at the cost of semantic complexity.

[.slide]
== Relationships

Relationships are fast to traverse and efficient.
Specialized relationship allow you to traverse the graph quickly.

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== Relationships

[.col]
====
Actors rated by a user.
