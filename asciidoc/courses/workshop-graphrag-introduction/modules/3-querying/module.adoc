= Building GraphRAG Agents
:order: 3

In this module, we will explore how to query a knowledge graph to retrieve the necessary context to complete a task.

These retrievers are universal and can be used within any tool in your framework of choice.

// We will start with a **LangGraph ReAct agent**, and will add tools to the agent to perform vector retrival and text-to-Cypher.
