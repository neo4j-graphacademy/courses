= Building GraphRAG Agents
:order: 3

In this module, we will explore how to query a knowledge graph to retrieve the necessary context to complete a task.

These retrievers are universal and can be used within any tool in your framework of choice.

In this module, you will:

* Learn about MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
* Explore different types of retrievers
* Use vector and relationship-based retrieval
* Implement text-to-Cypher retrieval

// We will start with a **LangGraph ReAct agent**, and will add tools to the agent to perform vector retrival and text-to-Cypher.
