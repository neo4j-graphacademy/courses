== Congratulations!
You've completed the GraphRAG Introduction workshop!

In this hands-on workshop, you've learned the fundamentals of GraphRAG - a technique that combines graph databases with generative AI to enhance LLM-generated content. You've explored how GraphRAG addresses limitations of traditional vector-based RAG by providing additional context through graph relationships and structured data.


[.slide.discrete]
== What you've learned

You've gained practical experience with:

* **GraphRAG fundamentals** - Understanding how knowledge graphs enhance retrieval-augmented generation
* **Knowledge graph construction** - Extracting structured information from unstructured data and storing it effectively
* **Three types of retrievers** - Vector, Vector + Cypher, and Text2Cypher retrievers, each with specific strengths and use cases
// * **LangGraph integration** - Using prebuilt ReAct agents to connect seamlessly with Neo4j
* **Real-world applications** - Working with financial documents and exploring practical GraphRAG implementations

You now have the foundational knowledge and hands-on experience needed to start building GraphRAG applications that use graph databases to enhance AI responses.

== Start Building with Neo4j

Get hands-on experience with your own Neo4j environment.

You can use **Neo4j Aura**, Neo4j's managed cloud service, which offers a free tier that includes up to 200,000 nodes and 500,000 relationships. With Aura, there is no setup required, allowing you to deploy instances quickly. It also provides automatic scaling, backups, and security updates, making it suitable for both prototyping and production applications.

Alternatively, you can use **Neo4j Desktop**, a local Neo4j development environment. Neo4j Desktop provides graph visualization tools, supports multiple database instances, and includes built-in monitoring and performance analysis tools. This makes it ideal for development, testing, and learning.

== Neo4j & Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Enhance your development workflow with AI-powered tools. The course **link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools/[Developing with Neo4j MCP Tools^]** teaches you how to use the Model Context Protocol to create intelligent AI applications with Neo4j's MCP server and tools for natural language database interaction.

The **Neo4j MCP Server** enables AI assistants like GitHub Copilot and Claude to interact with your Neo4j database using natural language. With MCP Server, you can query your database using conversational language, generate Cypher queries from descriptions, explore graph schemas and relationships, and build GraphRAG applications with AI assistance.

// You can also connect MCP tools to your development environment for seamless AI-assisted coding with Neo4j, thanks to IDE integration.
