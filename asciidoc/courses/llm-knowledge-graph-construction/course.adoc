== Course Description

In this hands-on course, you will use the knowledge gained in the link:/courses/llm-fundamentals[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals course^] to convert unstructured text content and turn it a Knowledge Graph that can be used to understand the relationships with your data.

=== Prerequisites

You should:

* Understand graph and Neo4 fundamental concepts - link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals[Neo4j and Graph Fundamentals^].
* Understand simple Cypher queries - link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals[Cypher Fundamentals^].
* Have an understanding of LLMs, Langchain, and vector indexes - link:/courses/llm-fundamentals[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^].
* Be able to read and understand simple Python programs.

* You may also find it useful to complete the following courses:
** link:/courses/llm-vectors-unstructured[Introduction to Vector Indexes and Unstructured data^].
** link:/courses/app-python/[Building Neo4j Applications with Python^].

=== What you will learn

What you will learn:

* What a knowledge graph is and how it can support the operation of GenAI applications.
* How a knowledge graph can be created from unstructured data using an LLM.
* How to use the LLM Graph Builder to create a prototype knowledge graph and explore your data.
* How to use Python, LangChain, and an LLM to create and query a knowledge graph.
