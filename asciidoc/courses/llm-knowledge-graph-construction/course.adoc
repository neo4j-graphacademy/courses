:key-points: Convert unstructured into a Knowledge Graph, Merging Data Sources

== Course Description

In this hands-on course, you will use the knowledge gained in the link:/courses/llm-fundamentals[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals course^] to convert unstructured text content and turn it a Knowledge Graph that can be queried through natural language using GPT-4's Cypher generation.


// to create a Movie Recommendation Chatbot backed by a Neo4j database.

// You will take a simple chat interface that repeats the user's input, and modify it to answer questions about movies via the Neo4j Recommendations Dataset using GPT-4, complete with conversational history.

// The chatbot will be able to answer questions like:

// * How many movies has Tom Hanks acted in?
// * What is the most popular movie in the database?
// * Can you recommend a movie for fans of The Matrix and Casino?

// At the end of the course, you will have a working chatbot built with link:https://streamlit.io/[Streamlit^].


=== Prerequisites

This course relies heavily on the information contained in the link:/courses/llm-fundamentals[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals course^].
If you have not already done so, we recommend completing this course first.

We also assume a basic understanding of Python.
It is not necessary, but you may also benefit from taking the link:/courses/app-python/[Building Neo4j Applications with Python^] course to understand how the Neo4j Python Driver works.

// The course uses link:https://streamlit.io/[Streamlit^] to build a simple chat interface.
// We do not focus heavily on the Streamlit functionality, so it may be worth reviewing the link:https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started[Streamlit Get Started guide^].
