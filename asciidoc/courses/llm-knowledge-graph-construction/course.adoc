== Course Description

In this hands-on course, you will learn how to create and query knowledge graphs using Large Language Models (LLMs).

You will use the Neo4j LLM Graph Builder and Python to build knowledge graphs from unstructured data.

You will learn how to query the knowledge graph using Cypher and LLMs to generate Cypher queries.

Finally, you will explore how to integrate into knowledge graphs into GenAI applications.

=== Prerequisites

You should:

* Understand graph and Neo4 fundamental concepts - link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals[Neo4j and Graph Fundamentals^].
* Have an understanding of LLMs, LangChain, and vector indexes - link:/courses/llm-fundamentals[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^].
* Be able to read and write simple Cypher queries - link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals[Cypher Fundamentals^].
* Be able to read and understand simple Python programs.

* You may also find it useful to complete the following courses:
** link:/courses/llm-vectors-unstructured[Introduction to Vector Indexes and Unstructured data^].
** link:/courses/app-python/[Building Neo4j Applications with Python^].
