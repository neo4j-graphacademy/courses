== Course Description

In this hands-on course, you will learn how to create and query knowledge graphs using Large Language Models (LLMs).

You will use the Neo4j LLM Graph Builder to build knowledge graphs from unstructured data.

Finally, you will learn how to customize the data model and query the knowledge graph using Cypher.

=== Prerequisites

You should:

* Understand graph and Neo4 fundamental concepts - link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals[Neo4j and Graph Fundamentals^].
* Have an understanding of GenerativeAI, LLMs, and vector indexes - link:/courses/genai-fundamentals[Neo4j & GenerativeAI Fundamentals^].
* Be able to read and write simple Cypher queries - link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals[Cypher Fundamentals^].
