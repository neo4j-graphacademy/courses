What are the implications of specifying allowed nodes and relationships in the LLM Graph Transformer?

Select all that apply.

[source, python]
----
doc_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(
    llm=llm,
    allowed_nodes=["Customer", "Product", "Price", "Sale"],
)
----

* [x] The graph may contain *less* information.
* [ ] The graph may contain *other* nodes.
* [x] The graph will *only* contain the nodes `Customer`, `Product`, `Price`, `Sale`.
* [ ] The graph will contain *no* relationships as none are not specified.

.Hint
====
Specifying `allowed_nodes` will result in a more concise knowledge graph.
The `allowed_relationships` parameter can be used to restrict the relationships.

.Solution
====
The correct answers are:

* The graph may contain *less* information.
* The graph will *only* contain the nodes `Customer`, `Product`, `Price`, `Sale`.

Relationships of *any* type will be included unless you specify the `allowed_relationships` parameter.
