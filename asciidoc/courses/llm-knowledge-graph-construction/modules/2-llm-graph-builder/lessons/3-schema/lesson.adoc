Currently, the LLM will extract any nodes and relationships in the text.
The graph can become complex even with a single, relatively simple document.

You can view the current schema using the `db.schema.visualization()` function.

This unrestricted schema can help understand granular details in the text.
However, you can focus on specific entities and relationships by defining a schema.

== Define a schema

The schema is a set of node labels and relationship types you want to identify within the text.

To define a schema, click the *Graph Enhancement* button.

You can load a pre-defined schema or supply a list of node labels and relationship types.

Try modifying the schema to include the following node labels:

* Technology
* Concept
* Skill
* Event
* Person
* Object

[IMPORTANT]
You must delete the existing document, re-upload the PDF, and regenerate the graph to apply the new schema.

Experiment with different schema configurations to see how the graph changes.


When ready, continue to the next module to learn how to create a knowledge graph.

== Summary

In this lesson, you customized the schema for the knowledge graph.

In the next module, you will explore the data model, and learn how to query the knowledge graph using Cypher.
