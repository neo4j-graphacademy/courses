= Querying using Cypher
:order: 2
:type: lesson

The graph generated by an LLM may not conform to a strict schema (depending on how you configured the LLM).
The lack of a strict schema changes how you query the graph.
You may not be looking to find a specific node or relationship, but rather a pattern or structure in the graph.

In this lesson, you will explore examples of how to query a knowledge graph using Cypher.

[TIP]
.Learning Cypher
====
You can link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[learn more about Cypher in the Cypher Fundamentals course].
====

The data structure of the graph contains both structured and unstructured elements.

Structured elements include the document and chunks.
Unstructured elements include the entities and relationships extracted from the text.

image::images/structured-unstructured.svg[A data model showing the structured and unstructured elements of a knowledge graph.]

You can use the structured elements to filter the graph and focus on specific parts of the graph.
The unstructured elements allow you to explore the relationships between entities in the text.

== Entities

The entities in the graph allow you to understand what the text is about.

For example, you can find the most mentioned topics in the graph by counting the number of times a node label (or entity) appears in the graph.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(e)
RETURN labels(e) as labels, count(e) as nodes
ORDER BY nodes DESC
----

A knowledge graph created from link:/course/llm-fundamentals[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^] course content contained the following entities:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|==================================
| labels                    | nodes
| [Capability]              | 189
| [Technology]              | 131
| [Concept]                 | 50
| [Benefit]                 | 44
| [Risk]                    | 35
| ["Technology", "Concept"] | 31
|==================================

[IMPORTANT]
.Inconsistent results
====
LLM's have inherent "randomness" and as such will generate different results, and therefore different entities, each time the graph is created.

As a result, you will see different results in your knowledge graph.
The numbers in these results are just one example.
====

You can drill down into the entity id to gain insights into the content.
For example, you can find the most mentioned `Technology`.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[r:HAS_ENTITY]->(e:Technology)
RETURN e.id AS entityId, count(r) AS mentions
ORDER BY mentions DESC
----

The course is about using Neo4j and LLMs with LangChain and OpenAI - this is reflected in the most mentioned technologies:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|=========================
| entityId      | mentions
| Neo4J         | 10
| vector search | 10
| LLM           | 9
| GraphRAG      | 9
| retriever     | 7
|=========================

== Relationships

The relationships in the graph allow you to understand how entities are connected and the context of the text.

This Cypher query matches all the entities between the chunks and the relationships between them:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(entity)-[r]->(other)<-[:HAS_ENTITY]-()
RETURN DISTINCT type(r) AS relType, count(r) AS number
ORDER BY number DESC
----

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|=======================
| relType       | number
| HAS           | 1242
| RELATED_TO    | 853
| USES          | 290
| ENABLES       | 178
| HAS_POTENTIAL | 158
| EXPLAINED_IN  | 51
|=======================

You can build statements about the content by using the entity and relationship data, for example:

`Technology` `Neo4J` `HAS` `Capability` `Vector search`

This Cypher query uses the entity labels, id, and relationship type to create these statements:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(entity)-[r]->(other)<-[:HAS_ENTITY]-()
RETURN DISTINCT
    labels(entity), entity.id, type(r), labels(other), other.id
----

[cols="5*", options="header"]
|===
| labels(entity) | entity.id                     | type(r)      | labels(other) | other.id
| [Technology]   | GenAI Frameworks              | HAS          | [Capability]  | Retrieval-augmented generation
| [Application]  | GenAI application development | USES         | [Technology]  | Neo4j
| [Technology]   | GenAI Frameworks              | RELATED_TO   | [Technology]  | Neo4j
| [Technology]   | GraphRAG for Python           | HAS          | [Capability]  | Knowledge graph construction
| [Technology]   | GraphRAG pipeline             | ENABLES      | [Benefit]     | more accurate responses
| [Skill]        | Vector Indexes                | USE_IN       | [Technology]  | Neo4J
| [Technology]   | Pip                           | INSTALLS     | [Technology]  | Youtube-Search
|===

This structured output from the content allows you to understand the relationships between entities in the text.

== Documents

The knowledge graph can also show you the connections within the content.
For example, what documents relate to each other.

This Cypher query matches one specific document and uses the entities to find related documents:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (d:Document {
    fileName: "genai-fundamentals_1-generative-ai_1-what-is-genai.pdf"
})<-[:PART_OF]-(c:Chunk)
MATCH (c)-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(entity)<-[:HAS_ENTITY]-(otherChunk)
MATCH (otherChunk)-[:PART_OF]->(otherDocument)
WHERE d <> otherDocument
RETURN DISTINCT entity.id, otherDocument.fileName
----

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
| entity.id             | otherDocument.id
| Generative AI         | genai-fundamentals_3-knowledge-graphs_1-what-is-a-knowledge-graph.pdf
| Large Language Models | genai-fundamentals_3-knowledge-graphs_2-constructing-knowledge-graphs.pdf
| LLM                   | genai-fundamentals_1-generative-ai_2-considerations.pdf
| LLM                   | genai-fundamentals_4-integrating-neo4j_3-rag.pdf
| hallucination         | genai-fundamentals_1-generative-ai_2-considerations.pdf
|===

The knowledge graph contains the relationships between entities in all the documents.
It is often useful to be able to restrict the output to a specific chunk or document.

This Cypher query restricts the output to a specific chunk or document:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (d:Document {
    fileName: 'genai-fundamentals_2-rag_1-what-is-rag.pdf'
})<-[:PART_OF]-(c:Chunk)
MATCH (c)-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(e)

MATCH p = (e)-[r]-(e2)
WHERE (c)-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(e2)

RETURN p
----

Only entities that are related to this document are returned.
The related entities are filtered by collecting a list of the entities (`entityList`) and including them in the final `WHERE` clause.

A path is returned representing the knowledge graph for this document.

image::images/document-entity-graph.svg[The graph output from the previous Cypher query.]

You can gain the nodes labels, ids, relationship types by _unwinding_ the path's relationships:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (c)-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(e)

MATCH p = (e)-[r]-(e2)
WHERE (c)-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(e2)

UNWIND relationships(p) as rels
RETURN
    labels(startNode(rels))[1] as eLabel,
    startNode(rels).id as eId,
    type(rels) as relType,
    labels(endNode(rels))[1] as e2Label,
    endNode(rels).id as e2Id
----

[cols="5*", options="header"]
|===
| eLabel     | eId                            | relType      | e2Label    | e2Id
| Technology | Retrieval-Augmented Generation | ENABLES      | Benefit    | generate more accurate and tailored answers

| Technology | embeddings                     | RELATED_TO   | Technology | vector search
|===

== Vector search

The chunks in the knowledge graph can be queried using the vector index to find similar entities.

The LLM Graph Builder created the chunk embeddings using the link:https://ollama.com/library/all-minilm[ollama `all-minilm` model^].

GraphAcademy has loaded some example text and embeddings using the `all-minilm` model so you can you explore vector search.

[source, cypher]
.View example embeddings
----
MATCH (n:Embedding)
RETURN n.text, n.model, n.embedding[0..5] as sample
----

You can use these embeddings to perform a vector search on the chunks in the knowledge graph.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Embedding {text:'What is retrieval augmented generation?'})
WITH n

CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('vector', 5, n.embedding)

.Vectors and Semantic Search
====
You can link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-vectors-unstructured[learn more about vectors indexes and semantic search in the Introduction to Vector Indexes and Unstructured Data course^].
====

The detail in the knowledge graph can be added to the results of the vector search to provide more context to the user.

This Cypher query finds the related nodes and relationships, unwinds the relationships, and outputs a single list of the entities and relationships per chunk.

== Communities

The LLM Graph Builder used link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/leiden/[Graph Data Science Leiden^] algorithm to find communities of entities in the knowledge graph.

You can view the communities by querying the `__Community__` nodes:

[source, cypher]
.Find communities
----
MATCH (n:`__Community__`)
RETURN n.title, n.summary
----

Each community has a relationship to a set of related entities:

[source, cypher]
.View community entities
----
MATCH (n:`__Community__`)<-[r:IN_COMMUNITY]-(e:`__Entity__`)
RETURN n,r,e
LIMIT 100
----

You can use the communities to summarize the entities in the documents:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:`__Community__`)<-[r:IN_COMMUNITY]-(e:`__Entity__`)
MATCH (e)<-[:HAS_ENTITY]-(c:Chunk)-[:PART_OF]-(d:Document)
RETURN DISTINCT d.fileName, n.title
ORDER BY d.fileName
----

This summary show the main topics covered in each document.
