Explore a pre-build knowledge graph in Neo4j



A knowledge graph has been pre-built in the Neo4j sandbox.

The knowledge graph represents just 3 news articles covering the 1976 United States presidential election:

- 1976-6: "Jackson wins Massachusetts Democratic primary."
- 1976-8: "Carter wins Pennsylvania Democratic primary"
- 1976-22: "Jimmy Carter wins Presidency"

====
The 3 articles were taken from the link:https://huggingface.co/datasets/dell-research-harvard/newswire[NewsWire dataset^] that contains 2.7 million unique public domain U.S. news wire articles, written between 1878 and 1977. 

The dataset was created to provide researchers with a large, high-quality corpus of historical news articles.
These texts provide a massive repository of information about historical topics and events - and which newspapers were covering them. The dataset will be useful to a wide variety of researchers including historians, other social scientists, and NLP practitioners.

You can view the Python code which extracted these articles from the dataset at TODO - link

The knowledge graph maps the relationships between the following entity types referred to in the articles:

- `Person`
- `Location`
- `Organization`
- `Building`
- `Political party`
- `State`

Run this Cypher to see how the entities from the articles are related to each other:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(e)
MATCH p = (e)-[r]-()
RETURN p
----

You can see that all 3 articles are connected within the graph through the `Person` entity `Jimmy Carter`.

The relationships within knowledge graphs allow you to explore how entities are connected and related to each other.

For example, how was `Jimmy Carter` connected to other `Person` entities:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {id:"Jimmy Carter"})-[r]-(p2:Person)
RETURN p, r, p2
----

image::images/jimmy-carter-person-graph.svg[A graph showing how jimmy carter is connected to other people]

You can use the nodes and relationships to understand how different entities are related, for example, `Person` and `State` entities:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r]-(s:State)
RETURN p, r, s
----

The following query will show you how the entities of a specific article are connected in the knowledge graph:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {id:"1976-8"})-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(e)
WITH collect(e) as articleEntities
MATCH p = (e)-[r]-(e2)
WHERE e in articleEntities and e2 in articleEntities
RETURN p
----

Restricting the entities to only those from a specific article will give you a structured data view of that article.

Take some time to explore the knowledge graph and see how the entities are connected.
