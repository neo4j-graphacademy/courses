= Integrate with a Retriever
:order: 3
:type: lesson
:branch: main

You can incorporate data from knowledge graph into a LangChain application using a link:https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/[Retriever^].
A retriever accepts unstructured input and returns structured output.

You can learn more about retrievers in the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-fundamentals/[Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals^] course.

== Vector & Graph

Open the `llm-knowledge-graph/retriever.py` code and review the program.

The program uses a Neo4j vector index to find similar documents, and uses the knowledge graph to add additional context.

Initially, the code opens an existing Neo4j vector:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/llm-knowledge-graph/solutions/retriever.py[tag=chunk_vector]
----

The `retrieval_query` is used to structure the output of the retriever:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/llm-knowledge-graph/solutions/retriever.py[tag=retrieval_query]
----

The query matches the entities and relationship for the chunks and returns the data in the format `nodeLabel` `entityId` `RELATIONSHIP_TYPE` `nodeLabel` `entityId`, for example `Technology Neo4j IS_A Technology Graph Database`.

The retriever is created from the `prompt`, `chunk_chain`, and `Neo4jVector`:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/llm-knowledge-graph/solutions/retriever.py[tag=retriever]
----

Run the `retriever.py` program, and enter a query relating to the data in the documents, for example, "What is a vector index?"

The program will return a list of link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#documents[Documents^], ordered by the most relevant first, with the associated knowledge graph data as metadata.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you explored how a Neo4j vector retriever can retrieve data from a knowledge graph.

In the next optional challenge, you can integrate the retriever into a chatbot.
