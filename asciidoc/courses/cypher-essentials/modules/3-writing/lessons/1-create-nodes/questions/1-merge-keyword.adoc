=== 1.Creating a node

Which Cypher keywords can you use to create nodes?

* [ ] `INSERT`
* [ ] `ADD`
* [x] `CREATE`
* [x] `MERGE`

[TIP]
====
There are 2 keywords you can use. One keyword checks to see if the node already exists so it won't be duplicated.
The other keyword does not check for duplicates, but it is more performant for bulk importing of data
