= Setting up the Project
:type: text
:order: 1
:java-version: 17

We have put together a project with all the boilerplate in place.
As you move through this course, you will learn some theory and then how to apply it to the example project.

In order to run the project, you must make sure that Java is installed.


== Setup Java

We are assuming that in taking this course, you already have at least a basic understanding of Java.

If you haven't already installed Java, you should install Java using link:https://sdkman.io[ sdkman^] with `sdk install java 17-open` and either set it as default or set to use it in your current shell.

.Install Java
[source,sh,subs="attributes+"]
----
sdk install java {java-version}-open
sdk use java {java-version}-open
----

[TIP]
.Installing SDKMAN
====
If you haven't already done so, you can install https://sdkman.io/[sdkman^] at https://sdkman.io/[sdkman.io^]
====


The project has been written to work with Java version **{java-version}**.

You can verify that the installation is successful by running the following command in the command line:

.Verify Java Version
[source,sh]
----
java --version
----

You will also need a package manager to install the dependencies and build and run the project.
We use Apache Maven with this project.
Maven is not included with Java, but you can also install it with sdkman.

.Install Maven
[source,sh]
----
sdk install maven
----


// == Clone the Repository

include::{shared}/lesson/clone-repository.adoc[]


== Install Dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the folder in your terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies and test the project: `mvn verify`

.Install Dependencies using Maven
[source,sh]
----
mvn verify
----

You can view a full list of dependencies by opening link:{repository-blob}/main/pom.xml[`pom.xml`^].

[NOTE]
.Failing tests
====
You will notice that some tests fail when you run `mvn verify`. During the course you will complete the project and resolve the issues.
====

[WARNING]
.Errors while installing dependencies?
====
This project has been written using Java version **{java-version}**.
If you are using the wrong version, you may experience errors when trying to install the dependencies.

If you experience any problems, run the following commands to set your Java configuration to the correct version for your current terminal session:

.Use Java Version {java-version}-open
[source,sh,subs="attributes+"]
----
sdk use java {java-version}-open
----
====


== Application Configuration

This project uses System properties to manage configuration variables for this project.
When the link:{repository-blob}/main/src/main/java/neoflix/AppUtils.java[`AppUtils.loadProperties()`^] method is called, the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` of the project is parsed and all settings made accessible from `System.getProperty`.

The project contains an example file at `{repository-blob}/main/src/main/resources[example.properties^]`.
You can run the following command from the root folder in your terminal window to copy the example file to `application.properties`.

[source,sh]
cp src/main/resources/example.properties src/main/resources/application.properties

== Start the Project

To start the project, run the following command:

.Start the project using Maven
[source,sh]
mvn compile exec:java

You should see an output similar to the following confirming that the server has successfully started:

.Console Output
[source,console,role=nocopy]
Started server on http://localhost:3000/

Unless you change the `APP_PORT` setting in `application.properties`, the server will listen on http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000^] which you can now open and browse around the app.
You can change which port the server listens on by editing the `APP_PORT` variable in `application.properties` and restarting the process.


== A Brief Tour of the Project

If you open up the listening address in your browser, you will see a Single Page Application (SPA) that communicates with the API served at http://localhost:3000/api/movies[http://localhost:3000/api/movies^].
Currently, the responses are hardcoded, but as you progress through the course, you will learn how to query Neo4j to find this information.

Here are some of the important directories in the project:

* `src/main/java/example/` - Example code for driver instantiation.
* `src/main/java/neoflix` - The application code:
** `src/main/java/neoflix/routes/` - Route handlers that are registered on the server.  You shouldn't need to edit these files.
** `src/main/java/neoflix/services/` - Services that you will need to update to interact with Neo4j.
* `src/test/java/neoflix` - Test files that will you will need to run in order to pass the test.  You will run these using the `mvn test` or individually with the +
`mvn test -Dtest=neoflix._0x_XxxTest#methodName` command.
* `src/main/resources/public/` - Minified build files for the Web application.  *Do not edit these files*.

== Next Steps

Now that we have the project up and running, let's take a look at the Neo4j Sandbox instance that has been created as part of your enrollment in this course.
