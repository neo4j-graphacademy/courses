= Configure Neo4j Connection
:order: 2
:type: lesson
:sandbox: true
:disable-cache: true

To connect to the Neo4j database, you will need to set a few configuration properties.

Complete the following steps:

1. In the `src/main/resources` folder, open the `application.properties` file and set the properties to your database credentials, matching the values below.

.application.properties File
[source,env,subs="attributes+"]
----
NEO4J_URI=[copy]#neo4j://{sandbox-ip}:{sandbox-boltPort}#
NEO4J_USERNAME=[copy]#{sandbox-username}#
NEO4J_PASSWORD=[copy]#{sandbox-password}#
----

Each of the above properties are as follows:

1. `NEO4J_URI` - the connection URI string for our database. For example, `neo4j://localhost:7687` or `neo4j+s://<dbhash>.databases.neo4j.io`.
2. `NEO4J_USERNAME` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` - properties to authenticate with the database.

[IMPORTANT]
.Applying Application Properties
Remember to restart the process after saving the `application.properties` file to apply the application properties.

Once saved, these can be accessed through the `application.properties` variable.

.Accessing Application Properties
[source,java,role=nocopy]
----
var properties = AppUtils.loadProperties();
var uri = System.getProperty("NEO4J_URI");
----

[TIP]
.Authentication Types
====
Neo4j supports four authentication methods, basic authentication (e.g. username and password or LDAP), a base64 encoded Bearer token, a Kerberos token, or a custom authentication token.
For more information on these options, visit link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/[Authentication and Authorization^].

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you added connection details to your application and tested the connection to the Neo4j database. This lesson completes Module 1 of the course.

In the next module, you will refresh concepts for interacting with Neo4j using the Neo4j Java driver and then apply these concepts in your application.
