= Movie Details
:type: challenge
:test-filename: _12_MovieDetailsTest
:branch: 12-movie-details

There are two methods remaining in the link:{repository-blob}/main/src/main/java/neoflix/services/MovieService.java[`MovieService`^] that are currently returning hardcoded data.

* <<findById()>> - should return information about a movie, including a list of actors, director, and genres.
* <<getSimilarMovies()>> - should return a list of similar movies, ordered by a score generated by Neoflix's recommendation algorithm.

In this challenge, you will update these methods to query Neo4j.

First, let's take a look at how these methods are used.

== Movie Page

If you click on any movie, you'll see that the API currently only returns information a limited set of movies from the fixtures in `popular.json`.

The page itself is populated by three API calls:

1. The details about the movie are loaded via the `api/movies/{id}` endpoint.  This endpoint gets its data from the <<findById()>> method.
2. The similar movies list is loaded by a call to the `api/movies/{id}/similar` endpoint, which gets its data from the <<getSimilarMovies()>> method.
3. The ratings on the right hand side of the page are loaded by a call to the `api/movies/{id}/ratings` endpoint.  You will update this method in the next lesson.


== findById()

Movie information is retrieved by the `findById()` method.

.src/main/java/neoflix/services/MovieService.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/main/java/neoflix/services/MovieService.java[tag=findById]
----

Most of the important information is held as properties on the `Movie` node, but the payload should also return some additional information.
We can use the  Cypher `size()` function to get a count of ratings for the movie and use a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/lists/#cypher-pattern-comprehension[Pattern Comprehension] to get lists of actors, directors and genres.

As with the other movie methods in the `MovieService`, we should also provide a `favorite` value to represent whether the user has added this movie to their My Favorites list or not.

The following Cypher query should be run within a **read transaction**:

.Movie Details
[source,cypher]
----
include::{cypher-repository-raw}/3-backlog/4-movie-view/movie-details.cypher[]
----


=== Your Task

* Modify the `findById()` method to query Neo4j and return details for the requested movie.
* The returned object should include a list of actors, directors, genres, and a boolean flag to represent whether the movie exists on the current user's My Favorites List.
* If no records are returned, the method should throw a `NotFoundError` (via the `single()` method on Result).
* Remember to close the session and use the `toMap()` function to convert the result object into native Java types.

== getSimilarMovies()

Similar movies are found using the `getSimilarMovies()` method.

To provide a simple set of similar movies, the Cypher query below uses the number of neighbors in common and their IMDB rating to generate a _similarity score_.

The following Cypher query should be run within a **read transaction**:

.Find Similar Movies

=== Your Task

* Modify the `getSimilarMovies()` method to query Neo4j and return a list of similar movies.
* The returned objects should include a list of actors, directors, genres, and a boolean flag to represent whether the movie exists on the current user's My Favorites List.
* Remember to close the session and use the `toMap()` function within the `list()` function on `result` to convert the values to native Java types.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you modified the `findById()` and `getSimilarMovies()` methods to return movie details from the Neo4j database.

In the next Challenge, you will complete the Movie page implementation by retrieving movie ratings from Neo4j.
