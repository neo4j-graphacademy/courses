If you click on the **Genres** link in the main navigation, you will be taken to a link:http://localhost:3000/genres[list of Genres^].
This list is populated by the API route at http://localhost:3000/api/genres, with the list being produced by the `all()` method within the link:{repository-blob}/main/src/main/java/neoflix/services/GenreService.java[`GenreService`^].

== Your Task

* Modify the `all()` method on the `GenreService` to query Neo4j and return a list of properties ordered by genre name.
* Each genre should have a name, the number of movies listed in that genre (`movies`), and a poster image (from the most popular movie in that genre).
* Remember to close the session and use the `toMap()` function `result.list` to convert the values to native Java types.
