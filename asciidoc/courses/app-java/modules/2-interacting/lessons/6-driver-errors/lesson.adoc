= Handling Driver Errors
:type: quiz
:branch: 06-unique-emails

:branch: main
:repository-raw: /tmp/app-java

When executing a Cypher query, certain exceptions and error cases may arise.

One error could be a _transient_ error that may be resolved if retried, for example a problem connecting to the database instance.

Another type of error could be something more permanent, for example a Syntax Error or a Constraint Error.

In the Neo4j Java Driver, exceptions of type link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/java-driver/current/org/neo4j/driver/exceptions/Neo4jException.html[`Neo4jException`^] will be thrown by methods that run into failure conditions.

The `Neo4jException` class extends the native Java `RuntimeException`, and as such contains a `message` property that contains detailed information about the error that has occurred.

== Error Codes

The `Neo4jException` also includes a `code()` method, which provides higher-level information about the query.

Each status code follows the same format, and includes four parts:

[source,rel=nocopy]
----
Neo.[Classification].[Category].[Title]
(1)        (2)          (3)       (4)
----

1. Every Neo4j Error code is prefixed with `Neo`.
2. The Classification provides a high-level classification of the error - for example, a client-side error or an error with the database.
3. The Category provides a higher-level category for the error - for example, a problem with clustering, a procedure or the database schema.
4. The Title provides specific information about the error that has occurred.


// === Classification

// There are four classifications of error:

// [cols="1,3,1"]
// |====
// | Classification | Description | Effect on transaction

// | ClientError
// | The Client sent a bad request - changing the request might yield a successful outcome.
// | Rollback

// | ClientNotification
// | There are notifications about the request sent by the client.
// | None

// | TransientError
// | The database cannot service the request right now, retrying later might yield a successful outcome.
// | Rollback

// | DatabaseError
// | The database failed to service the request.
// | Rollback
// |====


=== Example Error Codes

Here are some common error codes that you may experience:

* `Neo.ClientError.Procedure.ProcedureCallFailed` - Failed to invoke a procedure. See the detailed error description for exact cause.
* `Neo.ClientError.Schema.ConstraintViolation` - Added or changed index entry would violate constraint.
* `Neo.ClientError.Security.Forbidden` - An attempt was made to perform an unauthorized action.
* `Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized` - The client is unauthorized due to authentication failure.
* `Neo.ClientError.Statement.ParameterMissing` - The statement refers to a parameter that was not provided in the request.
* `Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError` - The statement contains invalid or unsupported syntax.
* `Neo.TransientError.General.TransactionMemoryLimit` - There is not enough memory to perform the current task.


For a comprehensive list of status codes, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/status-codes/current/[Status Codes in the Neo4j Documentation^].

//MH: Do we need a custom error-catcher? Or just use a RuntimeException with custom message?
== Catching Errors

Below is an example of how to catch an error thrown by the Driver. It is best practice to use `try` and `catch` blocks to catch any errors that are expected and handle unexpected errors at the service or routing level.

Here is an example of how a constraint violation error, could be handled in the auth service.

// == Query Errors

// First, let's take a look at how we can catch an error thrown while running a query.
// If you prefer, you can skip to <<Catching Errors>>.


// When an error is thrown,


// [source,rel=nocopy]
// Node(33880) already exists with label `User` and property
//  `email` = 'uniqueconstraint@example.com'

// === Catching the Error

// We can wrap the entire method in a try/catch block and then use the error message to detect the error.

// When a Neo4j Error is thrown, we can check the `code` property for a Neo4j specific code.
// In this case, we're looking for a code of `Neo.ClientError.Schema.ConstraintValidationFailed`.
// If the error is different, we should re-throw it so it can be handled by the application.




// == Catching Errors

// In order to correctly


// === Create a Unique Constraint

// In order to ensure that a property and label combination is unique, we will need to run a `CREATE CONSTRAINT` query.
// In this case, we would need to ensure that the `email` property is unique across all nodes with a `:User` label.

// Click the **Run in Sandbox** button to create the constraint on your Sandbox.

// [source,cypher]

// == Add a Try/Catch Block


// == Modify the Register Method





// This will seriously affect Neoflix's Daily Active Users numbers.

// As the `register` method is an `async` function, we will need to use a `try`/`catch` block to catch any errors as they are thrown.



// === Unique User Email Addresses





// As all of the methods in the `AuthService` are `async` functions, we can use

// We can pass the responsibility of handling the duplicate user error to the database by creating a Unique Constraint on the `:User` label, asserting that the `email` property must be unique.

// This also gives us the added benefit of an indexed property that we can look up User nodes by email without a costly `NodeByLabelScan`.


// == Catching Errors

// === Create a Unique Constraint

// === Modify the Register Method

// Currently, if the email address passed to the method isn't `graphacademy@neo4j.com`, a `ValidationError` is thrown.

// To create a Unique Constraint against a label, we can a one-time query against the database.
// If you want to learn more about indexes and constraints





// If we now run the following query in the Sandbox, a node should be created without any problems.

// [source,cypher]

// Running the query a second time should return the following error:

// [source,rel=nocopy]
// Node(33880) already exists with label `User` and property
//  `email` = 'uniqueconstraint@example.com'

// === Catching the Error

// We can wrap the entire method in a try/catch block and then use the error message to detect the error.

// When a Neo4j Error is thrown, we can check the `code` property for a Neo4j specific code.
// In this case, we're looking for a code of `Neo.ClientError.Schema.ConstraintValidationFailed`.

// You may also have noticed that the `session.close` call has been moved to the `finally` block.
// This is to ensure that is is always closed regardless of whether the query was successful or an error was thrown.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned how to interpret the errors thrown by the Neo4j Java Driver.

In the next Challenge, you will add a unique constraint to the database and add a `try`/`catch` block the `register()` method to handle the error thrown when the email address is already taken.
