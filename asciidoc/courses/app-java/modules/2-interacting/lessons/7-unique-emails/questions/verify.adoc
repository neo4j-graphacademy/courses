.Solution
====
If you haven't already done so, run the following statement to create the constraint:
[source,cypher]
----
include::../solution.cypher[tag=constraint]
----
The unit test then attempts to create a user twice with a random email address, with the test passing if the `ValidationException` error is thrown by the `AuthService`.
Once you have run this statement, click **Try again...*** to complete the challenge.
