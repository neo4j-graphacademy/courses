= Verifying the Test

Here is where things get interesting.

If you have completed the course to this point, you should have a project that connects to the Neo4j Sandbox instance.

If the test above has succeeded, there should be a `:User` node in the sandbox with the email address `graphacademy.register@neo4j.com`, name `Graph Academy`, and an encrypted password.


verify::[]

//appears when user clicks the Hint button
[TIP]
====
You can run the following query to check for the user within the database.
If the `shouldVerify` value returns true, the verification should be successful.
