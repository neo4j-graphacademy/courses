The challenges in this course come thick and fast!

In this challenge, you will modify the `add()` method in the link:{repository-blob}/main/src/main/java/neoflix/services/RatingService.java[`RatingService`^] to save ratings into Neo4j.
As part of the challenge, you will:

1. <<Save the Rating in a Write Transaction>>
2. <<Return the Results>>


== The Request Lifecycle

image::images/rating-form.png[Rating a Movie, role=right]

Before we start, let's take a look at the request lifecycle when saving a review.
If you prefer, you can skip to <<Save the Rating in a Write Transaction>>.

On every Movie page, the user is invited to rate a movie on scale of 1 to 5.
The form pictured to the right gives the user the ability to select a rating between 1 and 5 and click submit to save the rating.

When the form is submitted, the website sends a POST request to `/api/account/ratings/{movieId}` and the following will happen:

1. The server directs the request to the route handler in link:{repository-blob}/main/src/main/java/neoflix/routes/AccountRoutes.java#L80[`AccountRoutes.java`^], whose `/ratings/` route gets the authenticated user's id from the request.
2. The route handler uses an instance of the link:{repository-blob}/main/src/main/java/neoflix/services/RatingService.java#L62[`RatingService`^].
3. The `add()` method is called on the `RatingService`, and is passed the id of the current user plus the id of the movie and a rating value from the request body.
4. It is then the responsibility of the `add()` method to save this information to the database and return an appropriate response.

A rating is represented in the graph as a relationship going from a `:User` to a `:Movie` node with the type `:RATED`.  The relationship has two properties; the rating (an integer) and a timestamp to represent when the relationship was created.

// TODO arrows image

After the data is saved, the UI expects the movie details to be returned, with an additional property called `rating`, which will be the rating that the current user has given for the movie.

Let's take a look at the existing method in the `RatingService`.

Your challenge is to replace the `TODO` comments in this method with working code.

=== Save the Rating in a Write Transaction

For this part of the challenge, open a new session and execute the query within a _write_ transaction.
The singular `movie` result should be converted to a map.

include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/src/main/java/neoflix/services/RatingService.java[tag=write,indent=0]
----

[TIP]
By using the `MERGE` keyword for the relationship, we will reuse an existing rating if one already exists but override its attributes.

This way, we don't need to worry about duplicates or deleting existing records.

If no movie or user is found, the statement will return no records, then the `single()` method will throw an `NoSuchRecordException` error which we convert to a `ValidationException`.

=== Return the Results

Finally, return the movie.

== Lesson Summary

In this Challenge, you have updated the `RatingService` to save a relationship between a User and Movie to represent a Rating.

In the next Challenge, we will implement the My Favorites feature.
