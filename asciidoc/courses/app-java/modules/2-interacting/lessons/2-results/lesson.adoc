= Processing Results
:type: quiz
:repository-raw: /tmp/app-java

The Neo4j Java Driver provides you with three APIs for consuming results:

* **Synchronous** API
* **Async** API
* **Reactive** API


== The Three APIs

The most common and straightforward method of consuming results is with the synchronous API.

When using `session.run()`, `tx.run()`, or one of the two transaction functions, the query will return a `Result` object that you can process incrementally and then return the results of that processing.

For the asynchronous and reactive APIs you need to use different entry-points and API methods and helpers like a reactive framework.
In return you get more efficient resource usage in the database, middleware and client by using the non-synchronous APIs.

== The Result

The `Result` object, contains the records received by the Driver along with a set of additional meta data about the query execution and results.

An individual row of results is referred to as a `Record`, and can be accessed from the result various ways, as `Iterator<Record>` and via the stream()`, the `list()` or `single()` methods.

A `Record` refers to the keyed set of values specified in the `RETURN` portion of the statement.

If no `RETURN` values are specified, the query will not return any results, and record results will be empty or throw an error in the case of `single()`.

Additional meta data about the result and query is accessible from `Result` too (see below).

=== Records

You can access the records returned by the query through several means.
A `Result` is an `Iterator<Record>` there are `stream()` and `list()` accessors for streaming and materialization/conversion.

[TIP]
.Key or Index
You can either access a value within the record by using the alias as specified in the `RETURN` portion of the Cypher statement or by specifying the column index (not recommended).
The available keys can be accessed through `res.keys()`.

=== Result Summary

The meta data `ResultSummary` accessed from `Result.consume()` include

* statistics on how many nodes and relationships were created, updated, or deleted as a result of the query,
* the query type
* database and server info
* query plan with and without profile
* notifications

You can find more detail in the https://neo4j.com/docs/api/java-driver/current/org/neo4j/driver/summary/ResultSummary.html[API docs for ResultSummary^]

For example, to get information about how long the query took to complete, you can use the following property:

----

Another interesting part of the summary is the `SummaryCounters` available via `counters()`, which has update counts about a write-statement's execution.
You can check via `counters.containsUpdates()` if there were any updates.

== Lesson Summary

You now have all the information required to send Cypher queries to Neo4j and consume the results.

Next, we will look at the Cypher Type System and some of the considerations that you need to make when working with values coming from Neo4j in your Java application.
