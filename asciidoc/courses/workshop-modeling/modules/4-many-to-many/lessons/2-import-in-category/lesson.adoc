== Importing Categories and IN_CATEGORY relationships

You have Product nodes. Now import Category nodes and create IN_CATEGORY relationships to connect them.

In this challenge, you will work independently to import categories and create relationships between products and categories.

[.slide]
== File structure: categories.csv

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/northwind/categories.csv[categories.csv^] file contains category information (click the filename to download if needed):

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type | Description
| categoryID | Integer | Unique identifier for each category
| categoryName | String | Name of the category (e.g., "Beverages", "Produce")
| description | String | Description of the category
|===

This file has **8 rows** - one for each product category.

[.slide]
== File structure: products.csv

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/northwind/products.csv[products.csv^] file will be used to create IN_CATEGORY relationships (click the filename to download if needed):

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type | Description
| productID | Integer | Product identifier (foreign key)
| categoryID | Integer | Category identifier (foreign key)
| productName | String | Name of the product
| unitPrice | Float | Price per unit
|===

The `categoryID` column connects products to categories - this will be used to create IN_CATEGORY relationships.

[.slide]
== Create the Category node

In the **Data Modeling tab**, create a new node on the canvas.

[.slide]
== Configure the Category node

With the node selected, in the **Definition pane**:

1. **Set the label:** `Category`
2. **Select the table:** `categories.csv`

[.slide]
== Map Category properties

Use the **Map from table** button to add these properties:

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type | Rename To
| categoryID | Integer | id
| categoryName | String | name
| description | String |
|===

[NOTE]
.Verify the ID property
====
Verify the ID property is set to `id` and update if necessary.
====



[.slide]
== Create the IN_CATEGORY relationship

Drag from the Product node to the Category node to create a relationship.


[.slide]
== Configure the relationship

With the relationship selected, in the **Definition pane**:

1. **Set the type:** `IN_CATEGORY`
2. **Select the table:** `products.csv`
3. **Configure From node:**
   - Property: `id`
   - Column: `productID`
4. **Configure To node:**
   - Property: `id`
   - Column: `categoryID`





[.slide]
== Run the import

Click the **Run Import** button to create both the Category nodes and relationships.

Once the import is complete, you should see confirmation that **8 Category nodes** and **77 IN_CATEGORY relationships** were created.

[.summary]
== Summary

You imported Category nodes and IN_CATEGORY relationships into your graph.

* Created 8 Category nodes from categories.csv
* Mapped properties: id, name, and description
* Created 77 IN_CATEGORY relationships from products.csv
* Connected Product nodes to Category nodes

You've transformed the product-category pivot table into direct graph relationships.
