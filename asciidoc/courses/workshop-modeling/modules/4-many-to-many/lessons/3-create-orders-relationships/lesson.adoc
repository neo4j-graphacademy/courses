== Importing CONTAINS relationships

You have Order and Product nodes. Now create CONTAINS relationships with properties to transform the `order_details` pivot table.

In this challenge, you will complete the Customer→Order→Product path needed for recommendations.

== The Order Details Pivot Table

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/northwind/order-details.csv[order-details.csv^] file contains the pivot table data (click the filename to download if needed):

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type | Description
| orderID | Integer | The order identifier (foreign key to orders)
| productID | Integer | The product identifier (foreign key to products)
| quantity | Integer | How many units were ordered
| unitPrice | Float | Price per unit at time of purchase
|===

This file has **2,155 rows** - each row will become a `CONTAINS` relationship.


[.slide]
== Create the CONTAINS relationship

In the **Data Modeling tab**, drag from the Order node to the Product node to create a relationship.


[.slide]
== Configure the relationship

With the relationship selected, in the **Definition pane**:

1. **Set the type:** `CONTAINS`
2. **Select the table:** `order-details.csv`
3. **Configure From node:**
   - Property: `id`
   - Column: `orderID`
4. **Configure To node:**
   - Property: `id`
   - Column: `productID`


[.slide]
== Add relationship properties

Use the **Map from table** button to add these properties to the relationship:

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type
| quantity | Integer
| unitPrice | Float
|===

[NOTE]
.Understanding relationship properties
====
These properties belong to the connection itself - they describe how a specific product was ordered in a specific order. This data cannot be stored on either the Order or Product node.
====


[.slide]
== Run the import

Click the **Run Import** button to create the relationships.

Once complete, you should see confirmation that **2,155 CONTAINS relationships** were created.
