.Hint

Follow the steps in this lesson to create CONTAINS relationships.

Make sure to:

* Upload `order-details.csv` (2,155 rows)
* Create relationships (not nodes) with type `CONTAINS`
* Match Order nodes using `orderId`
* Match Product nodes using `productId`
* Add relationship properties: quantity (Integer) and unitPrice (Float)
* Click Run Import

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The CONTAINS relationship should connect:

* **From:** Order node (using orderId)
* **To:** Product node (using productId)
* **Relationship type:** `CONTAINS`
* **Properties:** quantity (Integer), unitPrice (Float)

After running the import, you should have 2,155 CONTAINS relationships, transforming the entire order_details pivot table into graph relationships.
