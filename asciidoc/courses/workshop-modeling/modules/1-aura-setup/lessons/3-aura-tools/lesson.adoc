== Exploring Aura Tools

You created your Aura instance and saved your credentials. Neo4j Aura includes several built-in tools for importing data, writing queries, and visualizing your graph.


In this lesson, you will learn about the key tools available in Neo4j Aura.


[.slide]
== Understanding the Aura Console

The Aura console is organized into three main sections:


* **Data Services** - Instances, Graph Analytics, Data APIs, and Agents
* **Tools** - Import, Query, Explore, and Dashboards
* **Administration** - Operations and Project management



[.slide]
== Understanding data services

The **Data Services** section provides access to your database resources:


* **Instances** - Your Neo4j database instances
* **Graph Analytics** - Advanced graph algorithms and analytics
* **Data APIs** - GraphQL and other API integrations
* **Agents** - AI agents for natural language database interaction


[.slide]
== Exploring the tools section

The **Tools** section contains four key tools for working with your data:


* **Import** - Visual data importer for data files
* **Query** - Write and execute Cypher queries
* **Explore** - Visualize and navigate your graph
* **Dashboards** - Build interactive visualizations

== Using the import tool

[.col]
====
The **Import** tool is a visual tool for importing tabular data into Neo4j.


**What you can do:**

* Upload data files
* Design your graph data model visually
* Map table columns to nodes and relationships
* Set up constraints and indexes
* Run the import with one click

[NOTE]
.Using the Import tool
You will use the Import tool extensively in the next module when you design and import your own data model.

[.slide]
== Using the query tool

The **Query** tool (also called Neo4j Browser) lets you:


* Write and execute Cypher queries
* Generate queries using AI assistance
* Visualize query results as graphs or tables
* Explore your data interactively
* Save and share queries


[.slide]
== Using the explore tool

The **Explore** tool provides:


* Interactive graph visualization
* Point-and-click navigation
* Node and relationship inspection
* Quick insights into your data


This tool lets you explore your data without writing queries.


[.slide]
== Using the dashboards tool

The **Dashboards** tool allows you to:


* Create interactive dashboards with multiple visualizations
* Build charts, graphs, and tables from Cypher queries
* Add filters to make dashboards dynamic
* Generate dashboards using AI assistance
* Share insights with stakeholders


Dashboards are great for monitoring data and creating visual reports.


[.slide.col-2]
== Managing administration

The **Administration** section provides management and monitoring capabilities:


[.col]
====
**Operations:**

* **Metrics** - Monitor database performance and resource usage
* **Logs** - View query logs and system events
====

[.col]
====
**Project:**

* **Users** - Manage user access and permissions
* **Billing** - View and manage billing information
* **Usage** - Track database usage and consumption
* **Activity Feed** - Monitor project activity
* **Settings** - Configure project settings
====

[.slide]
== Connecting to your instance

Your connection to an instance persists across all tools.

To connect and access tools:

1. Navigate to **Data Services** > **Instances** in the Aura console
2. Click the dropdown arrow on your instance card
3. Select the tool you want to use (Import, Query, Explore, or Dashboards)
4. Enter your credentials when prompted


Once connected, you can switch between tools without re-authenticating.


[.slide]
== Managing your connection

The connection bar at the top of the screen shows your current connection status and allows you to switch between instances.


From the connection bar, you can:

* See which instance you're currently connected to
* Switch to a different instance using the dropdown
* Disconnect from the current instance

== Ready to continue?

Now you have a Neo4j instance running, and have an understanding of the tools available to you in Neo4j Aura.

In the next module, you will learn about graph data modeling and use the Import tool to design a graph structure for your data.
