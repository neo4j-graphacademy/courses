== Mapping columns to properties

[.col]
====
Use the **Map from table** button to select the following columns to map to the node properties:

* productID
* productName
* quantityPerUnit
* unitPrice

[NOTE]
.Property Types
=====
The Import tool auto-detects types:

* **String** - Text values (productName, productId)
* **Integer** - Whole numbers (unitsInStock)
* **Float** - Decimal numbers (unitPrice)
* **Boolean** - true/false (discontinued)

If a type is wrong, you can change it in the property list.

== Rename the columns


[.col]
====
Use the pencil icon to rename the columns to remove the `product_` prefix:

* `productID` → `id`
* `productName` → `name`

This will make the properties more concise and easier to understand.
