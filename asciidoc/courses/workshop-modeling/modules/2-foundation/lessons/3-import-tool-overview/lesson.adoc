== The Import Tool

You identified nodes in the Northwind dataset. The Import tool provides a visual interface for defining your data model and loading data without writing code.


In this lesson, you will learn how the Import tool is organized, the workflow for importing data, and how mapping works.


[.slide]
== Understanding the import tool

The **Import** tool in Neo4j Aura helps you load data from various sources into your graph database without writing any code.

**Supported data sources:**

* Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
* Data warehouses (BigQuery, Databricks, Snowflake)
* Cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blobs & Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage)
* Local files (CSV)

**Key benefits:**

* **Visual** - Design your graph model with a drag-and-drop interface
* **No coding required** - Map tables and columns to graph elements without writing Cypher
* **Validated** - Preview your data before importing
* **Fast** - Optimized for bulk data loading

You'll find the Import tool in the left navigation of your Aura instance.


[.slide.col-3]
== Exploring the UI overview

The Import tool consists of **three main tabs** that reflect the three stages of importing:

[.col]
====
**1. Data Sources**

* Connect to databases, data warehouses, or cloud storage
* Upload local files
* View data source previews showing columns and sample data
* Manage multiple data sources for your import
====

[.col]
====
**2. Graph Models**

* Visual canvas where you design your graph model
* Create nodes and relationships
* Map tables/files to graph elements
* Configure properties and IDs
====

[.col]
====
**3. Import Jobs**

* View and manage import jobs
* Monitor import progress and results
* Review past imports and their status
====
// The workflow moves through these tabs: **Data Sources** → **Graph Models** → **Import Jobs**


[.slide.col-3]
== Following the import workflow

Importing data follows three main stages:

[.col]
====
**Stage 1: Provide the Data**

* Connect to your data source or upload files
* Configure connection settings (for databases/warehouses)
* Preview your tables/files to see columns and sample rows
====

[.col]
====
**Stage 2: Model and Map the Data**

* Design your graph model on the canvas
* Add nodes and set labels
* Map tables/files to nodes
* Select columns to become properties and set ID fields
====

[.col]
====
**Stage 3: Run the Import**

* Preview the import (optional but recommended)
* Execute the import to create nodes and relationships
* Review the results summary
====

&nbsp;

Let's explore each stage in detail.


[.slide.col-2]
== Connecting to data sources

[.col]
====
To choose a data source, navigate to the **Data sources** tab and click **New data source**.

From there, you can choose the source of your data.
Depending on which data source you choose, you will need to configure the data source and provide the credentials to connect to the data source.

The data source you choose must be publicly accessible.

For **CSV and TSV files**, you will be prompted to upload the files.
====

[.col]
====

====

// **Viewing your data:**

// * Each data source can be expanded to show columns and sample rows
// * Use the dropdown arrow to preview contents
// * Use the `...` menu to delete or manage sources


[.slide.col-3]
== Using the graph models tab

Once you have a data source connected, switch to the **Graph Models** tab to design your model.  The canvas has three panels:

[.col]
====
**1. Data Source Panel (left)**

* Shows your connected tables/files
* Expand to preview columns and sample data
* Drag to reorder or manage sources
====

[.col]
====
**2. Model Canvas (center)**

* Visual workspace for designing your graph
* Add nodes and relationships
* Position and organize your model
====

[.col]
====
**3. Details Panel (right)**

* Configure selected elements
* Two tabs: Definition and Constraints & Indexes
* Map tables/files to graph elements
====

[.slide]
== Creating and labeling nodes

**How to create a node:**

1. Click the **+ Node Label** button (bottom center of the data model pane)
2. A node appears on the canvas
3. Type the label directly on the node, or use the **Label** field in the details panel

// **Naming conventions:**

// * Use **CamelCase** for labels: `Product`, `Category`, `OrderDetail`
// * Use **singular** form: `Product` not `Products`
// * Be descriptive and consistent

[TIP]
.Node requirements
====
To complete the mapping process, every node needs a label, a data source, at least one property, and an ID property.

The green checkmark against each node and relationship indicates that all requirements are met and the data is ready import.
====


[.slide.col-2]
== Mapping tables to nodes

[.col]
====
To map a node to a data source:

1. Select your node on the canvas
2. In the details panel, find the **Table** dropdown under the Definition pane
3. Select the data source to map to this node
4. Choose **Map properties from table** to auto-populate properties
====

[.col]
====
TODO: Image or video
====

// **What happens:**

// * The Import tool reads the table columns
// * Each column can become a property
// * Data types are automatically detected (String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Date)
// * You can review and adjust the mappings

// **Mapping workflow:**

// This mapping process is the same regardless of whether your source is a database table or a file. The Import tool treats all sources uniformly once connected.


[.slide.col-2]
== Configuring properties

[.col]
====
Once a data source is mapped, you'll see properties listed in the **Definition** pane of the details panel.

**For each property, you can:**

* **Rename** - Click the pencil icon to change the property name
* **Change type** - Select the data type from the dropdown
* **Select Column** - select the column from the data source to map to this property
====

[.col]

[TIP]
.Available data types
====
The Import tool auto-detects data types from a sample of your source data.  You can change the data type of a property from the dropdown.

* **String** - Text values
* **Integer** - Whole numbers
* **Float** - Decimal numbers
// * **Boolean** - true/false values
// * **Date** - Date/datetime values
====

[.slide]
== Setting the ID property

The ID property uniquely identifies each node in the source data.

To set the ID property, select the column

Every node must have a unique identifier.  This ensures that each node is unique and can be identified within the source data.


[TIP]
.Automatic ID selection
====

The Import tool attempts to automatically select columns with "id" in the name, but you should verify this is correct for your data.
====

// **Common ID patterns:**

// * Primary keys from database tables
// * Unique identifiers like `productId`, `customerId`, `orderId`
// * Natural keys that uniquely identify entities


[.slide]
== Creating relationships

To create a relationship between two existing nodes:

1. Create and map both nodes you want to connect
2. Select one of the nodes on the canvas (the from node)
3. Hover over the selected node - a grey circle with a green plus sign appears (the _halo_)
4. Drag the halo to the other node and release
5. A relationship line is drawn between the two nodes

Once the relationship is created, you can configure its properties in the details panel.

[TIP]
.Create a node and relationship together
====
You can also create a relationship to a new node in one step by dragging the halo to an empty space on the canvas.
====


[.slide.col-2]
== Configuring relationship properties

[.col]
====
Once you create a relationship, select it to configure its properties in the **Definition** pane of the details panel.

**Required relationship settings:**

* **Type** - Name the relationship type (e.g., `PURCHASED`, `IN_CATEGORY`)
* **Table** - Select the data source that contains the relationship data
* **Node ID mapping** - Specify which nodes are connected
  - **From** - Identifies the source node using a column that matches the source node's ID property
  - **To** - Identifies the target node using a column that matches the target node's ID property
* **Properties** - Select columns to include as relationship properties
====

[.col]

[TIP,role=transcript-only]
.Relationship direction
====
All relationships have a direction in Neo4j. If you need to reverse the direction, select the relationship and use the reverse direction button in the details panel.
====


[.slide.col-2]
== Previewing the import

[.col]
====
Before running the actual import, you should preview your data.

**How to preview:**

1. Click the **Preview** button dropdown (next to Run Import)
2. Choose **Preview all** or **Preview selected**
3. The preview shows a sample of your data as a graph
====

[.col]
====
TODO: screenshot
====
// **What the preview shows:**

// * A visual representation of sample nodes and relationships
// * Only correctly mapped elements are shown
// * Does NOT import actual data (safe to run multiple times)

// **When to use preview:**

// * To verify your model looks correct
// * To check that properties are mapped as expected
// * To catch issues before the actual import

// **Note:** Preview uses only a sample of data, so it may look different from the full import in terms of size and connectedness.


[.slide.col-2]
== Running the import

[.col]
====
When you are ready to import your data, click the **Run Import** button.

Once completed, you'll see a results summary showing nodes created, properties set, time elapsed, and data processed.

For longer running imports, you can view the progress by navigating to **Import** and clicking the **Import Jobs** tab.
====

[.slide.col-2]
== Viewing import results

[.col]
====
Once the import is complete, a summary of the import will be displayed.

You can expand each element in the results to see the generated Cypher. This provides insight into how the Import tool constructs statements.
====

[.slide.col-3]
== Following best practices

[.col]
====
**Before importing:**

* Review your source data for quality and completeness
* Identify unique identifiers in each data source
* Plan your node labels and property names
* Understand the graph structure you're building
====

[.col]
====
**During modeling:**

* Use descriptive, singular labels (`Product` not `products`)
* Follow naming conventions (CamelCase for labels, camelCase for properties)
* Set appropriate data types for properties
* Always verify the ID property is correct
====

[.col]
====
**After import:**

* Verify the data with Cypher queries
* Check node counts match expected values
* Review the results summary for any warnings
* Test sample queries to ensure data is correct
