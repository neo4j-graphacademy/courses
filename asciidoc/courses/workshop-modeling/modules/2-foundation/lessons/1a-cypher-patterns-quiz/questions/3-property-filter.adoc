[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct operator for equality in WHERE clauses is `=` (single equals sign).

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
/* Find a specific customer by ID */
MATCH (c:Customer)
WHERE c.customerId = 'ALFKI'
RETURN c.companyName;
----

Note: Cypher uses `=` for comparison, not `==` like some programming languages.
