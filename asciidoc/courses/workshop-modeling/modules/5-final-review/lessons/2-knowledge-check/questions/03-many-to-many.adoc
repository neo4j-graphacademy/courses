In a graph, how do you typically handle a many-to-many pivot table?

.Solution
====
**C is correct:** Pivot tables become direct relationships. The 2,155 order_details rows became CONTAINS relationships.

Properties from the pivot table (quantity, unitPrice) move to the relationship.

**Recall Module 4:** Entire pivot table → relationships with properties. This eliminates an extra JOIN.
