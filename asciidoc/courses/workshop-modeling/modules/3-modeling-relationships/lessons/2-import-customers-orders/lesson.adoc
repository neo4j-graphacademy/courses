== Create Your First Relationships

You learned about relationships and why they matter.

In this lesson, you will create the PLACED relationship between Customer and Order nodes.


[.slide]
== File structure: orders.csv

The link:https://data.neo4j.com/northwind/orders.csv[orders.csv^] file contains the connection data (click the filename to download if needed):

[options="header"]
|===
| Column | Type | Description
| orderID | Integer | Unique identifier for each order
| customerID | String | Reference to customer (foreign key)
| orderDate | String | Date the order was placed
| shipName | String | Name for shipping
| shipCountry | String | Shipping country
|===

The `customerID` column connects orders to customers - this will be used to create PLACED relationships.


[.slide]
== Data source

If you completed Module 2, you should already have Customer and Order nodes in your graph. Use the button below to load the data model:

If you need to create Customer and Order nodes, return to Module 2, Lessons 5 and 6.

You should see your existing nodes (Product, Customer, Order) on the canvas.


[.slide]
== Create the PLACED relationship

Drag from the Customer node to the Order node:

1. Hover your mouse over the Customer node - a grey circle with a green plus sign appears
2. Click and drag your mouse to the Order node to create the relationship



[.slide]
== Configure the relationship

In the **Definition pane** on the right:

1. **Set the type:** Enter `PLACED` as the relationship type
2. **Select the table:** Under **Table**, select `orders.csv`
3. **Configure From node:**
   - Node: Customer
   - Property: id (the Customer's ID property)
   - Column: `customerID` (from orders.csv)
4. **Configure To node:**
   - Node: Order
   - Property: id (the Order's ID property)
   - Column: `orderID` (from orders.csv)

.How Relationship Mapping Works
====
The Data Importer uses the foreign keys in orders.csv (`customerID` and `orderID`) to match existing nodes and create relationships.

Each row in orders.csv will create one PLACED relationship.
====


[.slide]
== Run the import

Click the **Run Import** button to create the relationships. You will see a progress indicator while the import is running.

Once the import is complete, you will see a summary showing that **830 PLACED relationships** were created.

== Summary

In this lesson, you created your first relationships:

* **Created** PLACED relationships from Customer to Order (830 relationships)
* **Used** the foreign key pattern - orders.customerID matches Customer.id to create relationships
* **Configured** relationship type, direction, and mapping in the Definition pane
* **Dragged** from source node to target node to create the relationship line

You now have the first half of the path needed for recommendations: Customer→Order. In Module 4, you'll add Order→Product to complete the path.
