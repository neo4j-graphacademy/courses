If you want to skip ahead or catch up, you can load a pre-built data model at this stage.

**Steps:**

1. Open the Data Importer in your Aura instance
2. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** in the top right corner
3. Select **"Open model"**
4. Download and select this snapshot file:

button::Download Model Snapshot[role=NX_DOWNLOAD_FILE, file="snapshots/module-X-lessonY.zip"]

**What's included in this snapshot:**

* [Describe what nodes are included]
* [Describe what relationships are included]
* [Note: This loads the model definition only - you'll still need to run the import]

**After loading:**

1. Review the model on the canvas
2. Ensure you're connected to your Aura instance
3. Click **"Run Import"** to load the data
