= Writing Data to Neo4j
:type: challenge
:order: 5
:lab-file: src/challenges/write/challenge.ts
:lab-solution: src/challenges/write/solution.ts
:lab: {repository-blob}/main/{lab-file}
:branch: main

In this challenge you will use write data to Neo4j to add yourself as an actor in The Matrix.

Open the `{lab-file}` file that contains the starter code. 

== Steps

. Create the Cypher statement that will create new a `Person` node and `ACTED_IN` relationship to _The Matrix_ `Movie` node:
+
[source, typescript]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/{lab-solution}[tag=cypher]
----

. Create the `params` object and set your name:
+
[source, typescript]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/{lab-solution}[tag=params]
----

. Execute the Cypher statement using the `session.executeWrite()` method:
+
[source, typescript]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/{lab-solution}[tag=execute]
----

. Log the result to the console:
+
[source, typescript]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/{lab-solution}[tag=log_result]
----

== Run the Challenge

Run the file using `ts-node` to view the result:

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
ts-node {lab-file}
----

You can check the result in the Neo4j Browser by running the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Matrix, The"})<-[a:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
RETURN m, a, p
----

== Lesson Summary

In this challenge, you used your knowledge to create a driver instance and run a Cypher statement.

Next, we will look at the Neo4j Type System and some of the considerations that you need to make when working with values coming from Neo4j in your TypeScript application.
