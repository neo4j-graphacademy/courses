== The Neo4j JavaScript Driver

The Neo4j JavaScript Driver is available on NPM under the package name `neo4j-driver`.
You can install the Neo4j JavaScript Driver as a dependency by running the following command:

include::{repository-raw}/main/README.adoc[tag=install]


== Importing the Library

The `neo4j-driver` package exports a `neo4j` object which contains several helper functions for interacting with Neo4j.


.Importing The Driver
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=import]

== Creating a Driver Instance

The most prominent helper function on the `neo4j` object is the `.driver()` function, which accepts neo4j credentials and returns a new `Driver` object.

.Creating a Driver Instance
[source,ts,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=driver]
----

The function expects two arguments;

1. A Connection URI - for example, `neo4j://localhost:7687` or `neo4j+s://dbhash.databases.neo4j.io`
2. An authentication _token_
3. Optionally, link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/javascript-driver/current/function/index.html#static-function-driver[additional driver configuration^].


[TIP]
.Authentication Types
====
Neo4j supports four authentication methods, basic authentication (e.g. username and password or LDAP), a base64 encoded Bearer token, a Kerberos token, or a custom authentication token.
For more information on these options, visit link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/[Authentication and Authorization^].
====


=== Verifying Connectivity

You can verify that the connection details used during driver instantiation are correct by calling the `verifyConnectivity()` method.

This function returns a Promise which throws a `Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized` error if the provided credentials are incorrect.

== Sessions

From the Driver object, you will open one or more **sessions**.
A session is a client-side abstraction that borrows underlying TCP connections from a _connection pool_ held by the Driver and uses them to communicate with Neo4j.

Sessions should be considered lightweight and disposable and can be opened and closed at will.

Once you have run all the queries you intend to run within that session, you should call the `.close()` method to close the session.

Calling the `session.close()` method releases any connections still held by the session back to the driver pool.

.Session Lifecycle
[source,ts]
----
// Open a new session
const session = driver.session()

try {
  // Run a Query
}
catch {
  // Handle any errors
}
finally {
  // Close the session
  await session.close()
}
----


== Running a Sample Query

To run a one-off Cypher query, you can use the `session.run()` method.

.Running a One-off Query
[source,ts,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=oneoff]
----

The method accepts three arguments:

1. A string to represent a Cypher statement
2. Optionally, an object representing query parameters (prefixed in Cypher with `$`)
3. A third optional object containing transaction config.


[WARNING]
.For one-off queries only
If there are any transient errors when running a query, the Driver will not attempt to retry a query when using `session.run()`.
For this reason, these should only be used for one-off queries and not in production.

=== Processing Results

The `res` value in the sample above will implement the `QueryResult` interface.
The `QueryResult` interface guarantees access to the individual records returned by the query through the `records` property, which contains an array of `Record` instances.

The `Record` class has a `.get()` method, which provides access to the individual values held on that record.
For example, to get the `(:Person)` node from each record, you can write the following code:

.Accessing Results
[source,ts,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=oneoffresult]
----

We will cover result processing in more detail in link:../3-execute[Lesson 3: Read and Write Transactions^].


== Closing the Driver

The Driver provides a `.close()` method.
Calling this function will close any open sessions, disconnect all servers, and release any resources still held by the driver.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned the basics of the Neo4j JavaScript Driver, how to install the dependency, create a new Driver instance, and run a sample query.

In the next lesson, you will use this knowledge to create a new Driver instance and run a Cypher statement against a Neo4j Sandbox instance.
