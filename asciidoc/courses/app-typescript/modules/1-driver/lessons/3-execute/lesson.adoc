In the last challenge, you used `session.run()` to execute a Cypher statement in an auto-complete transaction.
While that may be convenient for one-off statements but is not suitable for production applications.

When using Neo4j in a clustered environment, the server will not attempt to retry the query when using `session.run()`.
In the case of transient errors, for example, changes to the cluster topology, Cypher statements explicitly executed within a read or write transaction will be retried in an attempt to cause minimal disruption to your application.


== Neo4j Clusters

When running Neo4j in production or using link:https://neo4j.com/cloud[Neo4j Aura^], you will most likely be querying a _cluster_ of nodes rather than a single instance.

Neo4j clusters consist of a set of _core_ nodes responsible for reaching consensus when writing data to a database.
Additional read-only servers called _Read Replicas_ can be added to increase the possible number of simultaneous read queries at any time.

In a clustered environment, the Driver can connect to any member within the cluster.
Once connected, the Driver will receive metadata about the cluster, known as a **Routing Table**.

=== Reading Data from Neo4j

The Driver uses data from the Routing Table to distribute read statements across the cluster in a least-connected fashion, ensuring that the cluster is evenly utilised.

To execute a Cypher statement within a read transaction, call the `executeRead()` method.

[source,ts]
.Read Transactions
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=executeread,indent=0]
----

The `executeRead()` method executes a unit of work, represented as a callback function (1), before marking the transaction as successful.
The callback function is passed an instance of a `ManagedTransaction`, on which the `run()` method can be called multiple times to execute Cypher statements (2).

The `run()` method is similar to `session.run()` in that it accepts two parameters; a Cypher statement and an object representing the query parameters.

=== Writing Data to Neo4j

The cluster will always contain one instance, known as the **Leader**, which has the responsibility of processing write transactions.
The Leader is responsible for distributing the transaction's outcome across the cluster.
Once the majority of core servers acknowledge this information, the transaction is considered _committed_ and acknowledgement is sent back to the Driver along with any data requested by the Cypher statement.

To execute a Cypher statement within a write transaction, call the `executeWrite()` method.

.Generics
We have not yet covered the `<T>` generic in the code samples above.
We will cover this later on in this course.


== Result Processing

Two methods are available for consuming results from a transaction, the **Promise API** and the **Streaming API**.


=== Promise API

The most common method of consuming results is with the Promise API.
Both `session.run()` and `tx.run()` return an instance of a `Result`, a Promise-like class upon which you can chain `.then()`, `.catch()` and `.finally()` methods.

Once the statement has been executed, and all results returned, the Result will _resolve_ to a `QueryResult` object.

[source,ts]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tags="executeread,promise",indent=0]
----

You can also iterate over the result returned by `tx.run()` or `session.run()` within a `for` loop.

.Using AsyncIterator

----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=iterate]
----


If you have long-running queries that explore a large part of the graph, it may take a while for the results to become available.
In this case, you should use the Streaming API.



=== Streaming API

There may be occasions where you have slower-running or more complex queries but wish to process results as they become available.

For example, many Flight search websites have complex queries that take up to a minute to complete, but shorter, less complex graph patterns may be available immediately.

In this case, you can use the `subscribe()` method to consume results as they become available.
This method is available when calling `session.run()` or `tx.run()` within a transaction function.

You can use this method with WebSockets or similar technologies to update the front-end application with new results as they are made available.

The `subscribe()` method accepts one argument, an object of callbacks:

* `onKeys` - called when keys are made available for all records.
* `onNext` - called when the next Record is available.
* `onError` - called if an error occurs.
* `onCompleted` - called when all records have been consumed, and no error has occurred.

=== Individual Results

In both examples above, individual records are accessed through an implementation of the `Record` type exported from `neo4j-driver`.
The `Record` type contains methods for interacting with each Record.

The `.keys()` method provides an array of available keys on the Record, and the `.has()` method can be called to check that a key exists on the Record.

.Get Keys
[source,ts,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=keys]
----

There are several ways to iterate over a record; `.forEach()` and `.map()` work as if the record were an `array`, and you can also call `.entries()` or `.values()` to act on the Record as if it were a `Map` object.
You can also access values within a `for` loop.

.For Loop
[source,ts,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=forloop]
----


To retrieve an individual value from a Record, call the `.get()` method.
The method accepts a single parameter, the alias of the value stated in the `RETURN` statement or the 0-based index of the value.

.Accessing a Value
[source,ts,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/src/example.ts[tag=value]

You can quickly convert the Record to a JavaScript object using the `.toObject()` method, a convenient way of converting nested values without recursively iterating through the Record.

.toObject
[source,ts,indent=0]
----
console.log(Record.toObject()) // {p: Node, r: Relationship, m: Node}

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned the best practices for reading data from and writing data to Neo4j.
You also learned how to access the records returned by `session.run()` and  `tx.run()`.

In the next challenge, you will use this knowledge to execute a Cypher statement in a read transaction.
