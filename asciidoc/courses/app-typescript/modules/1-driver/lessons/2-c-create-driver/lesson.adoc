:type: challenge
// :sandbox: #

In the IDE window to the right, we have written some code to get you started with the `neo4j-driver` dependency already included.

Your challenge is to use the `neo4j` object to create a new instance of the Driver with the connection details provided.

Once you have created the Driver, open a new session and run the following query:

.Find the Director of a Movie
[source, cypher]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/cypher/movie-director.cypher[]
----

[TIP]
.Pro-tip
