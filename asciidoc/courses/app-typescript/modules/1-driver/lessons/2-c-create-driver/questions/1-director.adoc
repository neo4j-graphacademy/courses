[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
You need to call the `neo4j.driver()` object to create a Driver instance using the `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` variables, then open a new session, execute the Cypher statement and log the `Director` value of the first record.

Your `console.log()` statement should look similar to the code block below:

[source,ts]
----
console.log(res.records[0].get('Director'))
----

Copy the answer without any quotes or whitespace.
