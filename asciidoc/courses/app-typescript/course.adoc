== Course Description

In this course, you will learn to interact with Neo4j in your TypeScript project using the Neo4j JavaScript Driver.

You will learn about the TypeScript-specific features, which add type-checking to any interactions with a Neo4j instance.

We also offer the link:/courses/app-nodejs/[Building Neo4j Applications with Node.js], which takes you step-by-step through how to build a movie recommendation website.


=== Prerequisites

By taking this course, we assume you have a working knowledge of TypeScript and NPM.
We also assume that you have at least a basic understanding of Neo4j.

If you haven't already done so, we recommend you also take the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals] course to gain a basic understanding of Neo4j and the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals] to understand how to query Neo4j using Cypher.
