== Module Overview

In the first lesson of this module, you will learn about:

* Leonhard Euler, the Swiss mathematician who founded the study of graph theory.
* Elements that make up a graph and how they are used to solve real-world problems.

* Common use-cases for graphs.

If you are ready, let's get going!
