Related to relational databases - what is the O(n) problem?

* [ ] The challenge of maintaining data integrity during database updates.
* [x] Increasing response times as database indexes grow larger due to more data.
* [ ] Difficulty in implementing security protocols in relational databases.
* [ ] The need to frequently back up data to prevent loss.

.Hint
====
When querying across tables in a relational database, the joins are computed at read-time, using an underlying index to find the corresponding rows in the target table.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The answer is "Increasing response times as database indexes grow larger due to more data".

Graph databases negate this issue by as the database stores a pointer to the relationship with each node.  So when the time comes to read the data, the database will follow pointers in memory rather than relying on an underlying index.
