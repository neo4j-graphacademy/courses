Now that you are thinking in graphs, let's take a look at the problem you are trying to solve and design a graph data model to solve it.

Tell me about the problem you are trying to solve, or the data that you are working with.  You can describe the data in natural language, describe your database schema, or paste in a couple of lines from a CSV file.

I can help you to:

* Identify the **nodes** in the data by extracting the nouns.
* Identify the **relationship** that connect the nodes by identifying the verbs.
* Identify the **properties** that describe the nodes and relationships.
