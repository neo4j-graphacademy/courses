== Use cases for graphs

You may have seen the phrase *Graphs are Everywhere* across the link:https://neo4j.com/[neo4j.com website^].
It is our hope that you will start to see the connections between things everywhere.


=== 1736 to the Present Day

Graph databases lean on **graph theory**, a concept that originated in 1730's Prussia.

The Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem asked whether it was possible to walk through the city, crossing each of its seven bridges exactly once without retracing steps.

Euler solved this by representing the landmasses as nodes and the bridges as relationships, forming a graph.

He proved that such a path was impossible because the graph required all nodes to have an even number of edges, which was not the case, thus laying the foundation for graph theory.

=== Graphs in Transportation

When you navigate a public transport network, you are effectively using concepts from graph theory, treating stations or stops as nodes and routes or connections as edges.

By finding the shortest or most efficient paths through this network, you are engaging in problem-solving similar to graph traversal, optimizing your route to reach your destination efficiently.

// TODO: Image

A higher level graph may contain weighted relationships between stops to represent the lines, while a lower level graph may model platforms within stations and services as nodes in the graph.

=== Graphs in Supply Chain Management

Transportation of goods is also a challenge in Supply Chain Management.
Will the distribution of goods be disrupted by problems with a distribution centre within the network?
This can be modelled in a graph database to enable real-time analysis and identify vulnerabilities that could affect supply chain resilience.

== Graphs in Fraud Detection

Financial institutions use graph databases to identify potentially fraudulent patterns by mapping relationships within their data.

Fraudsters aren't analyzed in isolation, but in the context of other fraudsters and their transactions. Algorithms and machine learning techniques can be used to
identify fraudsters based on similarity to known fraudsters or to reveal tight communities that may be fraud rings or money launderers.

link:https://neo4j.com/use-cases/fraud-detection/[Read more about detecting Fraud Rings with Neo4j^].

By the time a relational database calculates the complex relationships within a fraud ring, the criminals have already struck and have likely disappeared.
A graph database ensures that relationship-oriented queries are conducted in real time, so your anti-fraud team has a chance to strike first.

// === E-commerce and real-time recommendations

// Many online stores are traditionally built and run on relational databases.
// But by adding a graph database, either as a primary data store or as an additional data store, we can start to serve real time recommendations.

// The first area that can be improved in e-commerce is the category hierarchy.
// To find products in a parent and subsequent child categories can be difficult in a traditional SQL query, or require the duplication of data.
// Conversely, this can be represented in a couple of lines of Cypher:

// [source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
// ----
// MATCH (c:Category)-[:HAS_CHILD|HAS_PRODUCT*1..3]->(p:Product)
// RETURN p.id, p.title, collect(c.name) AS categories
// ----

// You may also be familiar with the *People who bought _{Product A}_ also bought...* sections on your favorite online store.
// These types of recommendations can be computationally expensive to generate due to the large amount of data that needs to be held in memory.
// This creates the need for batch processes to be deployed in order to generate the recommendations.

// Where graph databases have the advantage in this use case, is that a much smaller proportion of the graph needs to be traversed in order to generate the recommendation.
// You can simply traverse from one Product node, through the users who have purchased that product and onwards to the subsequent products that they have bought.

// Given the existing data in the graph about Customers, Orders, and Products, we can infer the rating for a product based upon the number of times the customer ordered a product.

// === Investigative journalism

// The most prominent user of Neo4j for investigative journalism is the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (https://icij.org[ICIJ^]).
// One such graph that was created by the ICIJ was the Panama Papers.
// The purpose of this graph was to identify possible corruption based upon the relationships between people, companies, and most importantly financial institutions.

// We have a subset of the Panama Papers investigation in a https://neo4j.com/graphgists/the-panamapapers-example-dataset-president-of-azerbaijan/[Neo4j Graphgist^] representing the family of the Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev.

// image::images/panama-papers-graphgist.png[Panama Papers Graphgist]


// The purpose of this graph to enable one to answer these questions:

// * What families with the name that contains the string 'aliye' are Officers of Companies?
// * How is the family with the name that contains the string 'aliye' related to Companies?
// * How are Officers related to each other?
// * What are the connections between multiple companies and a family?

// Another graph that has been created by the ICIJ  contains information on almost 350,000 offshore entities that are part of the Paradise and Panama Papers and the Offshore Leaks investigations.
// The Offshore Leaks data exposes a set of connections between people and offshore entities.
// You can play with this graph by creating a https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=icij-paradise-papers/[Paradise Papers Sandbox^] and querying the data.

// === Network and IT operations

// Many enterprises use Neo4j to help them understand how information flows through a system and how components of a network are related.
// This is useful for planning, analysis of costs, and also to troubleshoot problems when a problem arises.

// One of our Neo4j Community members contributed this sample data model to demonstrate how one might use a graph to identify network dependencies.
// Here is the data model:

// image::images/network-graphgist.png[Network Dependency Graphgist]

// You can use this type of data model to answer:

// * What are the direct dependencies of public websites?
// * What are the direct dependencies of internal websites?
// * What is the most depended-upon component?
// * Find the dependency chain for a business critical component.
// * What is the impact of removing a server?


// === Transportation and logistics

// image::images/supply-chain-graphgist.png[height=400,Supply Chain Graphgist,role=left]

// Here is an example data model contributed by a Neo4j Community member related to supply chain management.
// Entities that are modeled include raw suppliers, suppliers, products, wholesalers, and retailers.
// All of these entities are located somewhere and there is a distance between them that will impact how quickly products can be transported.

// With this graph, one can answer these questions:

// * Who is the best wholesaler for each retailer based upon distance?
// * Which raw supplier will give a particular retailer the freshest products?
// * Which retailer provides locally grown products?
// * How can we rate each supply chain?
