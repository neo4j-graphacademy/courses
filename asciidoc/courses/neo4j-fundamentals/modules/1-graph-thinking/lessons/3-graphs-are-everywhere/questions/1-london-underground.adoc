image::images/underground-weights.png[A simplified representation of the London Underground]

It is an undirected graph with nodes to represent the stations and relationships between each station to represent the lines that operate between.

The time it takes to travel between each station is stored as a property on the relationship.

You are at **Liverpool Street** and you would like ot get to Neo4j office near **Waterloo**.

Use the time properties to calculate the quickest route and select the answer.

* [ ] Circle direct
* [x] Central and Jubilee via Bond Street
* [ ] Central, Northern and Circle via Tottenham Court Road and Embankment
* [ ] Central and  Circle via Notting Hill Gate
* [ ] Circle and Northern via Euston Square

.Hint
====
Remember that the shortest route may not be in terms of relationships, but a property on the relationship.

Use a sum of the  `.time` properties on the relationships to calculate the time.

.Solution
====
The answer is **Central and Jubilee via Bond Street**.

Take the Central line to Bond Street (8mins + 10mins), then take the Jubilee from Bond Street to Waterloo (6 mins).
This route has a total time of 24 minutes.

Taking the Circle line takes a total of 28 minutes (8 + 12 + 8), two minutes slower than changing at Bond Street.
