You have used the `MATCH` clause to find patterns and read data from Neo4j.

In this lesson, you will learn how to create data.

== The `MERGE` Clause

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships

Experiment by creating nodes and relationships in the database.

Run this Cypher statement, that uses `MERGE` to create a new `Movie` node:

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {title: "Arthur the King"})
SET m.year = 2024
RETURN m
----

Run this Cypher statement, that creates `Movie` and `User` nodes and a `RATED` relationship between them.

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {title: "Arthur the King"})
MERGE (u:User {name: "Adam"})
MERGE (u)-[r:RATED {rating: 5}]->(m)
RETURN u, r, m
----

== The `MERGE` Clause

To create nodes and relationships in the database, you use the `MERGE` clause.

You can use the `MERGE` clause to create a pattern in the database.
`MERGE` will only create the pattern if it doesn't already exist.

=== Create a Movie node

Review this Cypher statement, that uses `MERGE` to create a new node:

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {title: "Arthur the King"})
SET m.year = 2024
RETURN m
----

You should be able to identify that:

* The `MERGE` clause is used.
* The pattern creates a node with the label `Movie` - `(m:Movie)`
* The `title` is included as part of the pattern - `{title: "Arthur the King"}`
* A single property `year` is set - `SET m.year = 2024`

Run the statement to create the new node.

The new node is returned and you can view the set properties.

=== Create a RATED relationship

Relationships are created by expressing a pattern that connects two nodes.

Review this Cypher statement:

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {title: "Arthur the King"})
MERGE (u:User {name: "Adam"})
MERGE (u)-[r:RATED {rating: 5}]->(m)
RETURN u, r, m
----

The statement creates:

* A `Movie` node
+ 
`MERGE (m:Movie {title: "Arthur the King"})`.
* A `User` node
+
`MERGE (u:User {name: "Adam"})`.
* A `RATED` relationship between them, that has a `rating` property of `5`
+
`MERGE (u)-[r:RATED {rating: 5}]->(m)`.

Run the statement to create the nodes and relationship.

[NOTE]
.Merging
====
MERGE uses the properties in the pattern to identify an existing node or relationship before creating it.

Running this query multiple times would only result in the nodes and relationship being created once.
`MERGE` checks to see if the pattern exists before creating it.
====

// [TIP]
// .Inline Where Clause
// ====
// This statement uses JSON-style syntax to specify the `WHERE` clause as part of the `MATCH` clause:

// [source,cypher,role=noplay nocopy]
// MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Arthur the King"})

// This is identical to using a `WHERE` clause.

// [source,cypher,role=noplay nocopy]
// MATCH (m:Movie)
// WHERE m.title = "Arthur the King"
// ====

== Create your own movie

The database is out of date - the latest movie is link:https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/339527-solace[Solace^] which was released in September 2016.

[%collapsible]
.Search for the most recent movies

Run this query to return movies order by the most recent release date:

.Latest Movies
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.released IS NOT NULL
RETURN m.title AS title, m.url AS url, m.released AS released
ORDER BY released DESC LIMIT 5
----

Modify this query to add your favourite movie and a user rating

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {title: "Movie title"})
MERGE (u:User {name: "User name"})
MERGE (u)-[r:RATED {rating: 1}]->(m)
RETURN u, r, m

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to use the `MERGE` clause to create nodes and relationships.

In the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals course^] you will learn more about reading and writing data to Neo4j.

In the next module you will learn how to get started with Neo4j and explore the Neo4j ecosystem.
