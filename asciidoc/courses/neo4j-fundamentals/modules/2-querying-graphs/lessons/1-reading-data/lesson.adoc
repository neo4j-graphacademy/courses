== Using Cypher

You can use the query language Cypher to interact with a Neo4j graph database.

You are you going to use Cypher to explore a graph database containing: 

* Movies, actors and directors from link:https://www.themoviedb.org/[The Movie Database (TMDB)^].
* Movie ratings by users of the website.

The graph contains `Person` and `Movie` nodes.
Each of `Person` node may have one or more outgoing `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships to a `Movie` node.

Movies are categorized into one or more genres, for example, Adventure, Animation, and, Comedy.
`Movie` nodes are connected to `Genre` nodes by an `IN_GENRE` relationship.

The graph also contains `User` nodes and over 100,000 movies ratings.
`User` nodes are connected to `Movie` nodes by a `RATED` relationship.

== Explore the Graph

GraphAcademy has created a link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com[Neo4j database instance^] for you.

=== People

Run the following Cypher statement to find a `Person` node with the `name` attribute 'Tom Hanks'.

[source,cypher]
.Tom Hanks
----
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE n.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN n
----

Each `Person` node has an unique `name` property, as well as other properties such as `bio` and `born`.

View the node properties by selecting the node.

Expand the node's relationships by doubling click the node.

image::images/tom-hanks-rels.svg[The Tom Hanks node connected to Movie nodes with ACTED_IN relationships]

You will see that there are `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships to `Movie` nodes.

=== Movies

Each `Movie` node has a unique `title` property, as well as other properties including `plot`, `released` and `url`.

Run the following Cypher statement to find the movie 'Toy Story' and the people who acted in the movie.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
RETURN m, r, p
----

image::images/toy-story-actors.svg[The Toy Story Movie node and Person nodes connected by ACTED_IN relationships]

The query uses the `[ACTED_IN]` relationship to find `Person` nodes who have a connection to the `Movie` node.

This Cypher statement uses the `[IN_GENRE]` relationship to find related `Genre` nodes.

[source,cypher]
.Movie Genres
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[r:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
RETURN m, r, g
----

image::images/toy-story-genres.svg[The Toy Story Movie node and Genre nodes connected by the IN_GENRE relationship]

You can return tabular data by including the properties of the nodes.

[source,cypher]
.List Movie Genres
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[r:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
RETURN m.title, g.name
----

Experiment with these queries. Try and find different movies and people, for example, the `Movie` node "Babe" or the `Person` node "Emma Stone".

=== User Ratings

Review this Cypher statement before running it and predict what graph will be returned.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE u.name = "Mr. Jason Love"
RETURN u, r, m
----

[%collapsible]
.Click here to reveal the result
====
The statement returns all the movies that have been rated by the user "Mr. Jason Love".

image::images/user-ratings.svg[A single User node connected to Movie nodes by RATED relationships.]
====

The **rating** the user has given for the movie is stored as a property on the `RATED` relationship.

Run this Cypher statement to return a table of movie ratings:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE u.name = "Mr. Jason Love"
RETURN u.name, r.rating, m.title
----

The properties are defined in the `RETURN`, for example `u.name` will return the `name` property of the `User` node.

[cols="3",options=header]
|===
|u.name|r.rating|m.title
|"Mr. Jason Love"|3.0|"Houseguest"
|"Mr. Jason Love"|3.0|"Ed Wood"
|"Mr. Jason Love"|4.0|"Little Women"
|"Mr. Jason Love"|4.0|"Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"
|"Mr. Jason Love"|5.0|"Circle of Friends"

// Maybe lose
// [TIP]
// ====
// You can view the database schema by running the following Cypher statement in the integrated query window to the right.

// [source,cypher]
// ----
// CALL db.schema.visualization()
// ----

// This is a built-in procedure that examines the database and returns the labels, relationship types and properties held in the database.

// You may notice that the `:Actor` and `:Director` nodes in the visualization have the same relationship types.

// For the purpose of the visualization, these are treated as different nodes but in the context of the database a `Person` can an `Actor`, `Director`, or both.

// This is an example of using multiple labels on a single node.
