In the previous lesson, you learned how Cypher can be used to read data.

In this lesson, you will explore how you match data with patterns.

== Patterns

Cypher is a **declarative** query language that allows you to identify **patterns** in your data using an **ASCII-art style syntax** consisting of **brackets**, **dashes** and **arrows**.

This pattern finds all nodes with a label of `Person`, that have an _outgoing_ `ACTED_IN` relationship to a node with a label of `:Movie`:

image::images/pattern-1.png[(p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)]

If you break this pattern down, it contains nodes, relationships and variables.

=== Nodes

Nodes in the pattern are expressed with parentheses - `( )`

image::images/pattern-2.png[parenthesis ( ) highlighted]

Inside the parentheses you can define information about the node, for example the label(s) or properties the node should contain.

image::images/pattern-3.png[:Person and :Movie highlighted]

Labels are prefixed a colon - `(:Label)`

The pattern contains two nodes `(:Person)` and `(:Movie)`.

=== Relationships

Relationships are drawn with two dashes (`--`) and an arrow to specify the direction (`<` or `>`) - `- ->`.

image::images/pattern-4.png[dashes - -> highlighted]

Relationship information is contained within square brackets -`[ ]`.

image::images/pattern-5.png[:ACTED_IN highlighted]

The relationship type is prefixed with a colon - `[:TYPE]`

The pattern contains one relationship `-[:ACTED_IN]->` between `(:Person)` and `(:Movie)` nodes.

To recap, this pattern: 

image::images/pattern-1.png[(p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)]

Finds `(:Person)` nodes, that have an `-[:ACTED_IN]->` relationship, to `(:Movie)` nodes.

=== Variables

The nodes and relationships in the pattern are assigned to variables.

image::images/pattern-6.png[p, r, n highlighted]

These variables are positioned before the information about the node or relationship.

* `p` - the `:Person` node
* `r` - the `:ACTED_IN` relationship
* `m` - the `:Movie` node

=== MATCH-ing

The `MATCH` clause is used to find patterns in the data.

Review this Cypher statement, you should be able to identify:

. The pattern being used.
. A `WHERE` clause which filters the results.
. The variables used in the `RETURN` clause.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p,r,m
----

Patterns can be as simple as a single node, or contain multiple relationships.

This example finds all people who have acted in movies with 'Tom Hanks', and uses the `RETURN` clause to define the properties.

[source,cypher]
.Actors who acted with Tom Hanks
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p2.name AS actor, m.title AS movie, r.role AS role
----

The pattern uses the ACTED_IN relationship to find the movies Tom Hanks is in, and then a second time to find the actors in the movies with Tom Hanks, 

The keyword `AS` is used to define an alias, for example, the property `p2.name` will be returned as `actor`.

// I dont think this is helpful. 
// Here are the equivalent SQL and Cypher statements side-by-side.

// [cols="1,1"]
// |===
// | SQL | Cypher
// | SELECT p2.name, r2.roles, m.title +
// FROM people p +
// INNER JOIN roles r on p.id = r.person_id  +
// INNER JOIN movies m on r.movie_id = m.id  +
// INNER JOIN roles r2 on m.id = r2.movie_id +
// INNER JOIN people p2 on r2.person_id = p2.id
// WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'

// | MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)  +
// WHERE m.title = ‘The Matrix’  +
// RETURN p.name, p.born, r.roles  +
// |===


// I think this should go in Cypher fundamentals.
// == How Cypher Works

// // Cypher's `MATCH` clause is used to find patterns in the data.

// image::images/MATCH.gif[A demonstration of pattern matching]

// When you specify a pattern, the underlying query engine will use the database schema and database statistics to determine how best to execute the statement.

// Once one or more *start nodes* at the start of the pattern are identified, the relationships of the node will be expanded by type and direction.
// The underlying datastore saves these relationships as pointers against the the nodes at the start and the end of the relationship, meaning the relationships can be **traversed** without relying on an underlying index.

// This is known as **Index-free Adjacency** (**IFA**).
// This is what makes Neo4j queries more performant in relation to `JOIN`s in relational databases.
