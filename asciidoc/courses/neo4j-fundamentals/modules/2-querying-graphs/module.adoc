= Querying Graphs
:order: 2

Graph databases have their own query language.  
Cypher is Neo4j's implementation of GQL, an ISO standard for graph databases.

Cypher is a declarative language, meaning that the database is responsible for finding the most optimal way of executing that query.

In this module you will learn about Cypher, including:

* The Cypher syntax
* Pattern matching
* How to use `MATCH` to read data 
* How to use `MERGE` to write data
