There are many options to use Neo4j, including a fully hosted cloud solution (link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/[AuraDB^]), local installations, and Docker containers.

In this lesson, you will explore some of these options.

== Community and Enterprise Editions

There are two editions of Neo4j to choose from, the Community Edition (CE) and the Enterprise Edition (EE). 
The Enterprise Edition includes all Community Edition offers, plus extra enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover capabilities.

The *Community Edition* is a fully functional edition of Neo4j, suitable for single-instance deployments. It fully supports key Neo4j features, such as ACID-compliant transactions, Cypher, and programming APIs. It is ideal for learning Neo4j, do-it-yourself projects, and applications in small workgroups.

The *Enterprise Edition* extends the functionality of Community Edition to include key features for performance and scalability, such as a clustering architecture and online backup functionality. Additional security features include role-based access control and LDAP support, for example, Active Directory. It is the choice for production systems with requirements for scale and availability, such as commercial and critical internal solutions.
