= The Movie Graph
:type: lesson
:order: 1
:sandbox: true

GraphAcademy has created a Neo4j sandbox instance for you.
The graph contains a dataset of movies and people.

In this lesson, you will explore the graph and use Cypher to query it.

== Nodes

The graph contains nodes labeled `Movie` and `Person`.

Neo4j includes a query language called Cypher that allows you to query the graph.

Run the following Cypher query to return the first 50 `Movie` nodes in the graph:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m LIMIT 50
----

You will see the `Movie` nodes returned as a graph.

Click on a node to see it's properties.
`Movie` nodes have properties like `title`, `released`, and `plot`.

Try modifying the query to return `Person` nodes instead of `Movie` nodes.

====
The following query would return all the `Person` nodes in the graph.
The query uses `Person` label to filter the nodes.
The variable `p` represents the `Person` nodes in the query.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p LIMIT 50
----
====

[TIP]
.All nodes
====
You can return all the nodes by removing the `LIMIT` clause.
It may take longer to return all the nodes.

----
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m
----
====

You can filter the nodes returned by adding a condition to the query.
For example, you can filter `Movie` nodes by the `title` property.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Toy Story'}) RETURN m
----

== Relationships

The relationships between nodes describe how people are related to movies.
For example, `Person` nodes have `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships with `Movie` nodes.

Run this Cypher query to return the `Movie` node 'Hoffa' and `Person` nodes with an `ACTED_IN` relationship to the movie:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Hoffa'})<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) 
RETURN m, r, p
----

image::images/hoffa.svg[A graph showing a Movie node titled 'Hoffa' with ACTED_IN and DIRECTED_IN relationships to Person nodes]

The movie 'Hoffa' is a `Movie` node with relationships to `Person` nodes who acted in and directed the movie.

[NOTE]
====
The query doesn't include the `DIRECTED` relationship, but it appears in the graph.

Neo4j will also display other relationships between the returned nodes to give a complete view.
====

Modify the query to return the movie 'Top Gun'.

====
The following query would return the movie node 'Top Gun' and the `Person` nodes with an `ACTED_IN` relationship to the movie.
The query uses the `title` property of the `Movie` node to filter the nodes.
The variable `m` represents the "Top Gun" `Movie` node, `r` is the `ACTED_IN` relationship, and `p` is the `Person` nodes.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Top Gun'})<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) 
RETURN m, r, p
----
====

[TIP]
.View relationships
====
You can double-click on nodes in the graph to expand their relationships with other nodes.
====

== Properties

Nodes have properties that describe them.
For example, `Person` nodes have properties like `name` and `born`, `Movie` nodes have properties like `title` and `released`.

Relationships in Neo4j can also have properties, the `ACTED_IN` relationship has a `role` property, storing the person's role in the movie.

Run the following Cypher to return the movie `title` and person's `name` who acted in the movie "Top Gun":

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Top Gun'})<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) 
RETURN m.title, p.name
----

Note how the query returns the data as a table, rather than a graph, of the movie title and person's name.

Modify the query to return the `role` property of the `ACTED_IN` relationship.

[%collapsible]
.Click to reveal the solution
====
The query includes `r.role` in the return.
The `r` variable represents the `ACTED_IN` relationship, and `r.role` returns the `role` property of the relationship.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Top Gun"})<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) 
RETURN m.title, p.name, r.role
----
