== Introduction

In this lesson you will learn:

* Snapshot creation and management
* How to restore from snapshots
* Understanding different backup types and schedules

A **snapshot** is a point-in-time copy of your database that you can restore in case of accidental changes, data loss, or to test changes safely without impacting your main database.

[.slide]
== Snapshot Types

Aura provides two types of snapshots to help you protect your data and maintain operational flexibility, full and sequential backups.

A **full snapshot** captures your entire database at a specific point in time - it's complete and self-contained.

A **differential snapshot**, on the other hand, only records the changes since the last full snapshot, making it more efficient but dependent on the full snapshot that came before it.

[NOTE]
.Exporting snapshots
You can use both types of snapshots to restore your database to a specific point in time, but only full snapshots can be exported.

[.slide]
== Scheduled Snapshots

Scheduled snapshots run automatically. The frequency of scheduled snapshots depends on your tier.

* **AuraDB Professional** and **AuraDS Professional** create snapshots once per day.
* **AuraDB Business Critical** creates snapshots every hour.
* **AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud** creates both daily full snapshots and hourly differential snapshots.
* **AuraDS Enterprise** creates daily snapshots.
// * **AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud (4.x)** creates snapshots every 6 hours.

== On Demand Snapshots

You can create a snapshot anytime using the **Take snapshot** button in the Aura console. This is useful before major changes or migrations.

Take a snapshot of your Aura Instance:

== Snapshot Actions

Each _full_ snapshot has the following actions via the more menu (**…**):

* **Export** - downloads a snapshot as a backup file for offline storage or use with other Neo4j installations
* **Create instance from snapshot** - creates a new instance with data from the snapshot. Your original instance remains unchanged.

The arrow icon image:{image-path}/restore-from-snapshot.png[Restore from snapshot icon] to the right of each snapshot item allows you to restore the snapshot to overwrite the current instance.

== Export

Export a snapshot of your Aura instance:

* TODO - add instructions and images to export and image
