== Introduction

The Metrics dashboard is your primary tool for monitoring the health and performance of your Aura instances.

In this lesson, you'll learn:

* Neo4j Aura performance metrics
* How to navigate the metrics dashboard
* Identifying CPU and memory usage, and out of memory errors


[NOTE]
.Free instances
====
Metrics are not available for Free tier instances.

[.col]
====
You can access the top-level metrics for an instance, CPU Usage, Storage, and Query Rate for the last 24 hours, by expanding the **Metrics** section at the bottom of each instance card.

From the expanded **Metrics** section, you can access the full set of metrics for the instance by clicking the **View all metrics** button.

This page can also be accessed directly from the left menu by expanding the **Operations** menu and selecting **Metrics**.

== Metrics Dashboard

====

[.col]
====
Metrics for your Neo4j Aura instances are split into three categories that can be accessed from the tabs at the top of the dashboard.
====


[.slide.col-2.reverse.discrete]
=== Resources

[.col]
====

====

[.col]
====
The **Resources** tab provides access to the resource utilization metrics for your instance.

* **CPU Usage**: The minimum, maximum, and average percentage of your CPU capacity being used within the timeframe.
* **Storage**: The percentage of disk space that is being used to store your data.
* **Out of Memory Errors**: The number of times your instance has run out of memory.  This is a critical metric and should be monitored closely.
====

=== Instance

[.col]
====
image::{image-path}/metrics-instance.png[The instance tab]
====

[.col]
====
The **Instance** tab provides access to the instance-level metrics that monitor the health and performance of your deployment.

* **Heap**: Shows min, max, and average heap memory use for query execution and managing your graph.
* **Page Cache**: Percentage of time needed data is found in memory, boosting query speed by reducing disk reads.
* **Page Cache Evictions**: Times per minute data is swapped out of memory—frequent spikes may mean your page cache is too small.
* **Bolt Connections**: Number of connections actively running Cypher transactions.
* **Garbage Collection**: Percentage of time spent freeing memory. Higher values suggest workloads are straining available memory.

====


[.slide.col-2.reverse.discrete]
=== Database

[.col]
====
image::{image-path}/metrics-database.png[The database tab]
====

[.col]
====
The **Database** tab provides access to metrics around the data stored in your instance.

* **Store Size**: Percentage of allocated and used space—shows your instance’s total data size.
* **Query Rate**: Queries executed per minute.
* **Query Latency**: How long queries take to run. 50th percentile is typical; 75th and 99th spotlight slower queries and trends.
* **Entities**: Total nodes and relationships, so you can track your graph’s growth.
* **Active Transactions**: Transactions currently underway per minute.
* **Transactions**: Total number of transactions run since startup.
* **Replan Events**: How often Cypher rebuilds query plans—frequent replans may mean inefficient queries or recent schema changes.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about performance metrics in Neo4j Aura and how to navigate the metrics dashboard.

In the next lesson, you will learn about memory usage analysis and optimization.
