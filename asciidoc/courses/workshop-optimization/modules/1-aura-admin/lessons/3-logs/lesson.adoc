== Exploring query logs

Query logs provide detailed visibility into every query executed against your database within the selected time period.

The **Summary view** shows an aggregated list grouped by the Cypher query.  This provides you with an overview of the most common queries and provides an insight into their performance.

* **Status**: The status of the query.
* **Count**: The number of times a query has been executed.
* **From**: The first time the query was executed.
* **To**: The last time the query was executed.
* **Total time spent**: The total time spent executing the queries.
* **Average time**: The average time spent executing the queries.

This view helps you to identify slow or inefficient queries, track query patterns and frequency, and optimize database operations.

The **Details view** provides the data on each individual query execution.

== Understanding security logs

Security logs track authentication and authorization events against your instance.

* **Status**: The status of the event.
* **Message**: The message of the event.
* **Executing user**: The user who performed the action.  This could be different from the authenticated user if the action was link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/dbms-administration/#access-control-dbms-administration-impersonation[performed through impersonation^].
* **Count**: The number of times an event has occurred.
* **From**: The first time the event occurred.
* **To**: The last time the event occurred.
* **Authenticated users**: The user(s) whose credentials were used to log in.

This view can help diagnose issues with authentication and authorization, and identify the number and source of connections to your database.

[TIP]
You can download the logs for further analysis or compliance purposes.
