In this challenge you will be presented with queries that exhibit common performance issues. 

You should:

. Use `PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN` to analyze the queries.
. Identify the root causes of the performance issues.
. Implement effective solutions to resolve the performance problems.


// Should these be questions?! Probably, not sure the best way to implement tho. Would it work in a workshop setting?
== Challenge 1:

Show a poorly performing query that can be optimized. Give an objective such as "Optimize the following query to improve its performance by reducing the run time."
