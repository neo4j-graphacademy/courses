=== 1. Specifying the relationship direction

Say we wrote our query above differently and started with the _Movie_ node.
Use the dropdown below to select the correct direction for the query.

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.


[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)/*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, p.name
----


* [ ] `+-[:ACTED_IN]->+`
* [x] `+<-[:ACTED_IN]-+`


[TIP]
====
When you specify a direction for a relationship in a query, the query engine only looks for nodes that have that direction in their relationships when the relationship was created.
If you specify `+-[:ACTED_IN]-+` in the pattern, it doesn't matter how the relationbships are created in the graph.
How is the relationship defined between _Person_ nodes and _Movie_ nodes?
