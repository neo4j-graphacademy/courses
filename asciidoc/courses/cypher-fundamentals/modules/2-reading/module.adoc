= Reading Data from Neo4j
:order: 2


In this module you will learn how to write Cypher code to retrieve data from the graph.

You will learn how to:

* Retrieve nodes from the graph.
** Retrieve nodes with a particular label.
** Filter the retrieval by a property value.
** Return property values.
* Retrieve nodes and relationships from the graph using patterns in the graph.

Using the Movies example dataset, you will create and execute Cypher code to find Actors and Movies in our graph.

== Domain model for this course

Here is the data model used in this course.
The graph contains nodes with the labels _Person_ and _Movie_.
_Person_ nodes have several types of relationships to _Movie_ nodes.
A _Person_ node can have a _FOLLOWS_ relationship to another _Person_ node.
