= Reading Data from Neo4j
:order: 1


In this module you will learn how to write Cypher code to retrieve data from the graph.

You will learn how to:

* Retrieve nodes from the graph.
** Retrieve nodes with a particular label.
** Filter the retrieval by a property value.
** Return property values.
* Retrieve nodes and relationships from the graph using patterns in the graph.
* Filter queries

Using the Movies example dataset, you will create and execute Cypher code to find actors and movies in our graph.

== Domain model for this course

Here is the data model used in this course.
The graph contains nodes with the labels _Person_ and _Movie_.
_Person_ nodes have several types of relationships to _Movie_ nodes.
A _Person_ node can have a _FOLLOWS_ relationship to another _Person_ node.
