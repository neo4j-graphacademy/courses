[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)/*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, p.name

* [ ] `+-[:ACTED_IN]->+`
* [x] `+<-[:ACTED_IN]-+`


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
How is the `ACTED_IN` relationship defined between _Person_ nodes and _Movie_ nodes?

The `->` and `<-` symbols specify the direction of the relationship.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
In the graph, the `:ACTED_IN` relationship always goes **from** a `:Person` node **to** a `:Movie` node.

As the `:Movie` node is defined as the first node in the pattern, the answer is `<-[:ACTED_IN]-`.

MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, p.name
