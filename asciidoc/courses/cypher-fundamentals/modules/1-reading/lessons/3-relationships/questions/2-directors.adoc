= 2. Query using a pattern

There is a `DIRECTED` relationship between the _Person_ nodes and the _Movie_ nodes - it represents the people who directed the movies.

Which `MATCH` clauses will return the names of people who directed movies? (Select all that apply)

* [x] `+MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person) RETURN p.name+`
* [ ] `MATCH (m:Movie)--(p:Person) RETURN p.name`
* [x] `+MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p) RETURN p.name+`
* [ ] `MATCH (m:Movie)-[:DIRECTED]->(p:Person) RETURN p.name`

.Hint
====
The _Person_ nodes represent people and the relationship must be _DIRECTED_.

You don't need to define the `:Person` label for the node at the end of the pattern.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====

The two options below are valid options for finding the people who directed movies:

`MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person) RETURN p.name` +
`MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p) RETURN p.name`


The following query, will return the directors but because the relationship type or direction type is not defined, you will receive _all_ people connected to that movie, including anyone who acted in the movie through the `:ACTED_IN` relationship.

`MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})--(p:Person) RETURN p.name`

The following query won't return any results because the direction of the relationship is defined as `->` instead of `<-`.

`MATCH (m:Movie)-[:DIRECTED]->(p:Person) RETURN p.name`
