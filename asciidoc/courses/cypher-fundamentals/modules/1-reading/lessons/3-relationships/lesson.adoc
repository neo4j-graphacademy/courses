== Finding relationships
[TIP]
.Our Goal
As a *movie fanatic* +
I would like to *find movies for a particular actor* +
So that I can *watch a movie this evening*


In the previous lesson, we used the `MATCH` clause to find the node in our database that represented _Tom Hanks_.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
RETURN p
----
We can extend the pattern in the `MATCH` clause to _traverse_ through all relationships with a type of _ACTED_IN_ to any node.
Our domain model shows that the _ACTED_IN_ relationship goes in an outgoing direction from the _Person_ node so we can add the direction in our pattern.
We often refer to this as a *traversal*.

.Incomplete code
[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->()
----

Our data model dictates that the node at the other end of that relationship will be _Movie_ node, so we don't necessarily need to specify the _:Movie_ label in the node - instead we will use the variable _m_.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
RETURN m.title
----

This code returns the titles of all movies that _Tom Hanks_ acted in.

If our graph had different labels, for example Television and _Movie_ nodes this query would have returned all _Television_ and _Movie_ nodes that Tom Hanks acted in.
That is, if we had multiple _types_ of nodes at the end of the _ACTED_IN_ relationships in our graph, we could make sure that we only return movies.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN m.title
----

Because our graph only has _Movie_ nodes that have incoming _ACTED_IN_ relationships, this query returns the exact same results as the previous query.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to traverse patterns in the graph with your queries using relationships.
In the next challenge, you will demonstrate your skills for traversing the graph.
