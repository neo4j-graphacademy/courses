= 1. Filtering a value in a list

Suppose you want to retrieve all movies that have a _released_ property value that is 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, or 2008.  Here is an incomplete Cypher example to return the _title_ property values of all movies released in these years.
What keyword do you specify in the `WHERE` clause?
