=== 1. Filtering a value in a list

Suppose you want to retrieve all movies that have a _released_ property value that is 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, or 2008.  Here is an incomplete Cypher example to return the _title_ property values of all movies released in these years.
What keyword do you specify in the `WHERE` clause?

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.


[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)/*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, p.name
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.released /*select:IN*/ [2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008]
RETURN m.title
----


* [ ] `+FROM+`
* [x] `+IN+`
* [ ] `+CONTAINS+`
* [ ] `+IS+`
