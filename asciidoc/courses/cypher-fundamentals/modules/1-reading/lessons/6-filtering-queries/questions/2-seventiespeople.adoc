= 2. Finding people born in the seventies.

We want to write a `MATCH` clause  to retrieve all _Person_ nodes for people born in the years 1970 to 1979.

Select *all* `WHERE` clause that will filter this query properly:

[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (a:Person)
// WHERE clause
RETURN a.name, a.born
----

* [x] `+WHERE a.born >= 1970 AND a.born < 1980+`
* [x] `+WHERE 1970 <= a.born < 1980+`
* [ ] `+WHERE a.born = 1970 OR a.born = 1979+`
* [x] `+WHERE a.born IN [1970,1971,1972,1973,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979]+`

You can use a range test or a list test to filter the nodes.

.Solution
====
The following answers are the recommended ways of finding a number between two values:

`+WHERE a.born >= 1970 AND a.born < 1980+`

`+WHERE 1970 <= a.born < 1980+`

This answer is also correct, but the above methods are more efficient:

`+WHERE a.born IN [1970,1971,1972,1973,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979]+`

This answer is incorrect, as the predicate is looking for a range of numbers, not just 1970 or 1979.

`+WHERE a.born = 1970 OR a.born = 1979+`
