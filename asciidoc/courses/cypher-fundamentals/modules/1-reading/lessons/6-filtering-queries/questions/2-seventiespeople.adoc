=== 2. Finding people born in the seventies.

We want to write a `MATCH` clause  to retrieve all _Person_ nodes for people born in the seventies.

Select the `WHERE` clauses below that will filter this query properly:

MATCH (a:Person)
// WHERE clause
RETURN a.name, a.born


* [x] `+WHERE a.born >= 1970 AND a.born < 1980+`
* [x] `+WHERE 1970 <= a.born  < 1980+`
* [x] `+WHERE a.born IN [1970,1971,1972,1973,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979]+`
* [ ] `WHERE a.born IN [1970..1979]`

[TIP]
====
You can use a range test or a list test to filter the nodes.
