== What is Cypher?
Cypher is a query language designed for graphs.

The whiteboard model of our domain entities is stored in the database as a graph.
When we draw a graph on the whiteboard, we represent entities as circles connected together using arrows.
In this example, the entities are people and movies. We have _Person_ and _Movie_ nodes in our graph.

Just as we would draw circles and arrows on a whiteboard, we write out the pattern in Cypher:

* Nodes are represented by parentheses `()`.
* We use a colon to signify the label(s), for example `(:Person)`.
* Relationships between nodes are written with two dashes, for example `(:Person)--(:Movie)`.
* The direction of a relationship is indicated using a greater than or less than symbol `<` or `>` , for example `(:Person)-->(:Movie)`.
* The type of the relationship is written using the square brackets between the two dashes: `[` and `]`, for example `[:ACTED_IN]`
* Properties drawn in a _speech bubble_  are specified in a JSON like syntax.
** Properties in Neo4j are key/value pairs, for example `{name: 'Tom Hanks'}`.

For example, a Cypher pattern in the graph could be:

[source,Partial,role=nocopy noplay]
----
// example Cypher pattern
(m:Movie {title: 'Cloud Atlas'})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
----

The two node types in this pattern are _Movie_ and _Person_.
The _Person_ nodes have a directed _ACTED_IN_ relationship to _Movie_ nodes.
The specific _Movie_ node in this pattern is filtered by the _title_ property with a value of _Cloud Atlas_.
So this pattern represents all people in the graph who acted in the movie, _Cloud Atlas_.


=== How Cypher works

Cypher works by matching patterns in the data.
We retrieve data from the graph using the `MATCH` keyword.
You can think of the `MATCH` clause as similar to the FROM clause in an SQL statement.

For example, if we want to find a _Person_ in the graph, we would `MATCH` a pattern of a single node with a label of `:Person` - prefixed with a colon `:`.

[source,Partial,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (:Person)
// incomplete MATCH clause because we need to return something
----

Suppose we want to retrieve all _Person_ nodes from the graph. We can assign a variable by placing a value before the colon.
Let's use the variable `p`. Now that `p` represents all _Person_ nodes retrieved from the graph, we can return them using the `RETURN` clause.

Run this Cypher code:

[TIP]
Click the *Run in Sandbox* button to the top right of the code sample to open the Sandbox to the right and run the query.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN p
----

This query returns all nodes in the graph with the _Person_ label.
You can view the results returned using the graph view or the table view.
When you select the table view, you can also see the properties for the nodes returned.

Now, say we want to find the node which represents the _Person_ who's name is  _Tom Hanks_.
Our _Person_ nodes all have a _name_ property.
We can use the __braces__ `{..}` to specify the key/value pair of _name_ and _Tom Hanks_ as the filter.
As _Tom Hanks_ is a string, we will need to place it inside single or double quotes.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
RETURN p
----

This query returns a single node that represents _Tom Hanks_.
In the graph view of Neo4j Browser, the node is visualized as a bubble.
You can also view the results returned in table view where you can view the properties of the node.

In our Cypher statement, we can access properties using a _dot notation_.
For example, to return the _name_ property value using its property key  `p.name`.


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
RETURN  p.born
----

This query returns the value of the _born_ property of the _Tom Hanks_ node.

[IMPORTANT]
--
In Cypher, labels, property keys, and variables are case-sensitive.
Cypher keywords are not case-sensitive.

Neo4j best practices include:

* Name labels using **CamelCase**.
* Name property keys and variables using **camelCase**.
* User **UPPERCASE** for Cypher keywords.
--

Another way that you can filter queries is by using the `WHERE` clause, rather than specifying the property value inline with braces.

This query returns the same data as the previous query.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p.born
----

As you gain more experience with Cypher, you will find that using `WHERE` to filter your queries is very powerful because you can add more logic to your `WHERE` clause.
Here is an example where we filter by two values for _name_.


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks' OR p.name = 'Rita Wilson'
RETURN p.name, p.born
----

This query returns two names and their associated birth years.

// | p.name |
// | -- |
// | Tom Hanks |
