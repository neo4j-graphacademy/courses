= 3. Removing properties

Suppose we want to remove all _tagline_ properties from all _Movie_ nodes in the graph.

Use the dropdown below complete the code.

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
/*select:REMOVE m.tagline*/
RETURN  m
----


* [ ] `REMOVE tagline`
* [ ] `DELETE m.tagline`
* [x] `REMOVE m.tagline`
* [ ] `DELETE tagline`

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
This `MATCH` clause will select all _Movie_ nodes in the graph and reference it with the variable m.
What clause do you use the remove the property for every node retrieved.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
`REMOVE m.tagline` is the correct answer. We have a reference to the Movie node so we can use the `REMOVE` clause to remove the property.

`REMOVE tagline` is incorrect, because we do not have a reference to the node.

There is no `DELETE` clause in Cypher.
