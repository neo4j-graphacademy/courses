[copy]#Emil Eifrem# is not really an actor! We no longer want him in the database. 

You task is to write the code to delete his node in the graph.

You can see the node by running the following code:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (e:Person {name: "Emil Eifrem"})-[]->(n)
RETURN e, n
----

Note that the node has relationships to other nodes in the graph.
The relationships will also need to be deleted.
