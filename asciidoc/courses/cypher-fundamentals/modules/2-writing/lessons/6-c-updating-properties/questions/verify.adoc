.Hint
====
Use MATCH to find the _Movie_ node and then use SET to add the properties using the reference to the node.
Use a comma (,) to separate the properties you are adding.

For example:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (x.Label)
SET x.firstProp = "xxx", x.secondProp = yyy
----

Find the Movie and check that the node's properties have been set:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'})
RETURN m.title, m.tagline, m.released
----

If you view the node in table view, you will see the properties.

The properties name and values are case sensitive.
