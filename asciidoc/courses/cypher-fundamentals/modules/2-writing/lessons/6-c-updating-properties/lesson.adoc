= Adding Properties to a Movie
:type: challenge
:order: 6
:sandbox: true

In the link:../4-c-create-relationship/[Creating a Relationship^] challenge, we created a new _Movie_ node for the movie *Get Out*.  However, we forgot to add a a tagline or release year.

Run this Cypher, you will see that the `tagline` and `released` properties are `null`:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'})
RETURN m.title, m.tagline, m.released
----

Modify this Cypher to use the `SET` clause to add the following properties to the _Movie_ node:

* [copy]#tagline#: [copy]#Gripping, scary, witty and timely!#
* [copy]#released#: [copy]#2017#
