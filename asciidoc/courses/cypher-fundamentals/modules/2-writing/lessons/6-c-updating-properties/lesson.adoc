= Adding Properties to a Movie
:type: challenge
:order: 6
:sandbox: true

In the link:../4-c-create-relationship/[Creating a Relationship^] challenge, we created a new _Movie_ node for the movie *Get Out*.  However, we forgot to add a a tagline or release year.

If you execute the code in the sandbox window, it will return the _Movie_ node, but the tagline and released properties have no values. That is, these properties have not been added to the node.

Write the Cypher code to find this _Movie_ node and add the _tagline_ and _released_ properties for the node with the values below.

* *`tagline`*: [copy]#Gripping, scary, witty and timely!#
* *`released`*: [copy]#2017#
