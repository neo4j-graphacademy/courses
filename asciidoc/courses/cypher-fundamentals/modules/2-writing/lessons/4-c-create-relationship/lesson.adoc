:type: challenge
:order: 4
:sandbox: true

In this challenge, you will apply what you have learned to find a node, create a new node, and create a relationship between them.

== Create an ACTED_IN Relationship between Daniel Kaluuya and the movie Get Out

Replace the ????? in the Cypher statement to:

. Find the _Person_ node for [copy]#Daniel Kaluuya#.
. Create a _Movie_ node, with a `title` property of [copy]#Get Out#.
. Add an [copy]#ACTED_IN# relationship between _Daniel Kaluuya_ and the movie, _Get Out_.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
include::sandbox.cypher[]
----

You can confirm that the relationship was created using the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Daniel Kaluuya'})
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'})
MATCH (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
RETURN p, m
