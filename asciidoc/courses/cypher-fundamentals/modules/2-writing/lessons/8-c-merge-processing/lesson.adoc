= Adding or Updating a Movie
:type: challenge
:order: 8
:sandbox: true

In this challenge, you will use `ON MATCH` and `ON CREATE` clauses to add the date and time when nodes are created and updated.

Your task is to create a Cypher script which will add `createdAt` and `updatedAt` to `Movie` nodes:

. The `createdAt` property should be set to the current date and time when the node is created.
. If the node already exists, the `updatedAt` property should be set.

Update this Cypher statement, replacing the `????`, to use [copy]#ON CREATE# and [copy]#ON MATCH# clauses to set the [copy]#createdAt# and [copy]#updatedAt# properties.

[source, cypher]
----
include::sandbox.cypher[]
----

The first time you run the code, the `createdAt` property should be set. The second time, the `updatedAt` property should be set.

You can check the values have been set correctly by running the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Rocketman'})
RETURN m.title, m.createdAt, m.updatedAt

In this challenge, you demonstrated how to add or update properties when a node is created or found in the graph.
In the next lesson, you will learn how to delete nodes and relationships from the graph.
