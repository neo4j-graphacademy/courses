[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The following query uses a `MERGE` clause to find or create a `:Movie` node with the title _Rocketman_.

When initially created, the `createdAt` property will be set but the `updatedAt` property will be null.

If the node already exists, the `createdAt` property will not be set, but a `updatedAt` property will be set.

You will need to run this query twice to see the `createdAt and `updatedAt` properties.
