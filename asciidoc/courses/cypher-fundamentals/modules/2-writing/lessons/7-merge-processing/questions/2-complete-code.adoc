= 2. Update an existing node in the graph

Our graph has a _Person_ node for _Lucille Ball_.
Suppose we want to add the year that _Lucille Ball_ was born to this node.
The _Person_ node for _Lucille Ball_ has only the _name_ property set to _Lucille Ball_.

How can we update this code to include her birth year of 1911?

Use the dropdown below complete the code.

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Lucille Ball'}}
/*select:ON MATCH*/
SET p.born = 1911
RETURN p
----


* [ ] `ON UPDATE`
* [ ] `ON CREATE`
* [x] `ON MATCH`
* [ ] `ON FOUND`

.Hint
====
Remember that `MERGE` first does a `MATCH` and if not found, it wll create the node.
Since the Lucille Ball node already exists, what condition do we expect when `MERGE` executes?
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
`ON MATCH` is the correct answer. We want the property set when the Lucille Ball node is found in the graph.

You use `ON CREATE` for behavior to execute if the node is created.

There are no `ON UPDATE` ot `ON FOUND` clauses in Cypher.
