= Writing Data to Neo4j
:order: 2


In this module you will learn how to update the graph using Cypher and the Movies example dataset.

You will learn to:

* Use `MERGE` to create nodes in the graph.
* Use `MERGE` to create relationships in the graph.
* Create, update and remove properties for nodes and relationships in the graph.
* Perform conditional `MERGE` processing, depending on what is in the graph.
* Delete nodes and relationships from the graph.


== Domain model for this course

Again, here is the domain model and how it is represented in our graph:

== Resetting the database

In this module you will be modifying the graph. In the next lessons and challenges, you will see a `RESET DATABASE` button you can click before you start a lesson or challenge if you need to make sure your database is compatible with where you should be in the lesson or challenge.
