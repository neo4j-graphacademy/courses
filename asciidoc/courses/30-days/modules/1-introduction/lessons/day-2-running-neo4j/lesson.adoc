Running Neo4j can be done in several ways: binary download, Docker, or using Neo4j Aura, a cloud-based service. Let's quickly explore each option.

[Visual: Binary download process]

For binary download, visit the Neo4j download page and choose the appropriate version for your operating system. Extract the downloaded archive, and run the appropriate start script. This will launch a local instance of Neo4j on your machine.

If you prefer Docker, pull the official Neo4j image from Docker Hub, and run it using the appropriate command for your environment. This will create a containerized instance of Neo4j, ensuring better isolation and easier management.
