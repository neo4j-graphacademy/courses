In this 30-day email course, you will learn everything you need to build a data model, import data, write Cypher queries, and put Neo4j into production.

Every weekday, you will be delivered a new lesson to your inbox.
We break each lesson down into bitesize chunks that you should be able to read during your morning coffee.

At the weekend, you will receive an additional challenge that will test you on the knowledge you have learned during the week.


== Prerequisites

This course assumes a basic understanding of databases and programming concepts.
No prior experience with Neo4j or graph databases is required.

== Course Structure

Throughout this 30-day course, learners will engage in various tasks to solidify their understanding of Neo4j and graph databases, including:

* Setting up and running Neo4j AuraDB Free instance.
* Writing basic to advanced Cypher queries to create, read, update, and delete data.
* Learning and applying data modeling concepts, such as nodes, properties, labels, and relationships.
* Refactoring and optimizing data models to better represent real-world scenarios.
* Exploring graph data science with AuraDS and understanding its common use cases.

Each lesson includes a video and text content, as well as additional resources for further learning.

== Outcome

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

* Understand the fundamentals of Neo4j and graph databases
* Efficiently model data and write complex Cypher queries
* Leverage advanced Cypher features and APOC procedures
* Build a graph-based application and work with graph data science use cases
* Apply best practices for using Neo4j in production environments

We encourage you to actively participate and practice the concepts taught in each lesson. By the end of the course, you’ll have a solid foundation in Neo4j and be ready to tackle real-world projects and applications.
