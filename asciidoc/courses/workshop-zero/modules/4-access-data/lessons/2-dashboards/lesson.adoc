== Building dashboards with AI assistance

You can create a new AI generated dashboard using "Create with AI".

Enter the prompt - "Metrics related to Customers and Orders" 

The AI will then generate a dashboard based on your description.

[.slide]
== Create a dashboard card

Click **Add a card** to create a new visualization:

Dashboard cards are individual components that display specific data visualizations.

* Change the card title from "New card" to "Customer Orders Overview"
* Select **Graph** from the visualization type dropdown
* Paste the following Cypher query in the Query field:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)<-[r:PLACED_BY_CUSTOMER]->(o:Order)
WHERE c.companyName = 'Eastern Connection'
RETURN c,r,o
----

[.slide]
== Making dashboards interactive with filters

Filters allow users to dynamically change what data is displayed without modifying queries.

You will create a filter that lets users select a specific customer to view their orders.

On the dashboard select **Add filter**.

Create a filter with the following settings:

* Filter type: **Node property**
* Node label: `Customer`
* Property key: `companyName`

== Linking filters to dashboard cards

Update the Customer Orders Overview card query to use the filter parameter.

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)<-[r:PLACED_BY_CUSTOMER]->(o:Order)
WHERE c.companyName = $customer_companyname
RETURN c,r,o
----

The dashboards tool is useful for:

* Quick data exploration and validation
* Creating stakeholder presentations
* Building operational monitoring dashboards
* Prototyping before investing in custom applications

In this lesson, you created a dashboard in Aura using the AI assistant, and modified it by adding cards and filters.

In the next lesson, you will create an agent to interact with your graph data using natural language.
