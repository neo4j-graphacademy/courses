== Create a dashboard card

You can modify the dashboard by adding new cards:

. Click **Add a card** to create a new visualization.
+
Dashboard cards are individual components that display specific data visualizations.
. Change the card title from "New card" to "Customer Orders Overview"
. Select **Graph** from the visualization type dropdown
. Use the following Cypher query in the Query field:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)<-[r:PURCHASED]->(o:Order)
WHERE c.companyName = 'Eastern Connection'
RETURN c,r,o
----

== Making dashboards interactive with filters

[.col]
====
Filters allow users to dynamically change what data is displayed without modifying queries.

You will create a filter that lets users select a specific customer to view their orders.

On the dashboard select **Add filter**.

Create a filter with the following settings:

* Filter type: **Node property**
* Node label: `Customer`
* Property key: `companyName`
====

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)<-[r:PURCHASED]->(o:Order)
WHERE c.companyName = $customer_companyname
RETURN c,r,o
----

Dashboards enable rapid prototyping of data visualizations and serve as the bridge between your graph database and stakeholders.

The dashboards tool is useful for:
