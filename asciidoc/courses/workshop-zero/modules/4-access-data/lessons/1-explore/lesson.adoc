== Features of the Explore tool

* **No Cypher knowledge required**: You can explore your data without needing to write Cypher queries.

* **Visual exploration**: You can interact with your data visually, making it easier to understand relationships and patterns.

* **Editing capabilities**: You can edit nodes and relationships directly in the graph view, without needing to write Cypher commands.

* **Perspectives**: You can create and share Perspectives, which are predefined views of your data that can include specific search phrases and styling options.

== Considerations

1. The model has to be understood. You can explore the data knowing what the database holds and how it is organized.

2. Security does apply. If the user's role does not allow editing the database this step will not work. The user will be informed about that.

3. Defining these queries (also known as **search phrases**) does require knowledge of Cypher syntax. As the Perspectives can be shared, not everybody needs to have that knowledge.
