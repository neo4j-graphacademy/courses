[NOTE]
.It depends!
====
There is no right or wrong way to complete the challenge.

The model you created is just as valid. A model is partially driven by the questions you want to ask of the data and the insights you want to gain. Your experience is different to others and your model may be different. 

Graph data models in Neo4j can be easily evolve as your use case changes.
