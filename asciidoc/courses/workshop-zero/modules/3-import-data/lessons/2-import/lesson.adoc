:order: 2

You are going to import a relational dataset into your Neo4j Aura instance using the Import tool.

You will need to:

. Download the Northwind dataset
. Create a new graph data model
. Open the Northwind dataset in the Import tool
. Map the tables to the graph data model
. Run the import

== Northwind Dataset

The Northwind dataset contains data about a fictional company called Northwind Traders, which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world.

== Create a graph data model

You need to link:data/northwind-customer.zip[download the Northwind dataset^] and create a new blank graph data model:

. link:data/northwind-customer.zip[Download the Northwind dataset^]
. Open the *Import* tool in Aura and select *Graph Models*. 
+
image::images/aura-import-graph-annotated.png["Aura Console - Import - Graph Models"]
. Create a new graph data model.
. Use the `...` menu to `Open model (with data)` and select the `northwind-customer.zip` file you downloaded.
+
image::images/open-model-with-data-annotated.png["... menu - Open model with data"]

You will see the tables (csv files) from the Northwind dataset in the left-hand panel, and a single Customer node in the graph data model.

== Review the Data Source

Review the data source tables and try to identify:

- What tables will become Node labels
- The associated relationships between tables through their primary/foreign keys
- What fields will become properties on nodes and relationships

== Customer node

The `Customer` node has already been created for you. 

Select the node in the graph data model and review the data model in the right hand panel.

image::images/select-customer-node.gif["Selecting the customer and showing the data model details"]

You should be able to identify the following:

* The node label - `Customer`.
* The source table - `customers.csv`.
* The node properties - the `name`, what data `type` is used, and what `column` from the source table is used for each property.
* What property is used as the unique ID for the node label - `customerId`.


== Run the import

Run the import to create the `Customer` nodes:

. Click *Run Import*
. Select your instance
+

. Enter your instance credentials
. A summary of the import will be displayed
+

You can view the Customers in the graph using the Query tool:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
.Customer nodes
----
MATCH (c:Customer)
RETURN c

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you imported customer data from the Northwind dataset and started to build a graph data model.

In the next lesson, you will continue to build the graph data model by adding `Order` nodes and `PURCHASED` relationships between customers and orders.
