= Graph Algorithms

== Module Overview

In the previous course, link:/courses/gds-product-introduction[Introduction to Neo4j Graph Data Science^], you learned about the graph catalog and how to create and managed graph projections.

In this module, you will learn about the robust collection of graph algorithms available in GDS and how to use them on real data. We will start this module off with a lesson on algorithms tiers and execution modes you have an understanding of general usage patterns.  After that we will cover our 5 biggest algorithm categories.

The module outline is as follows:

* Algorithm Tier and Execution Modes
* Centrality and Importance Algorithms
* Path Finding Algorithms
* Community Detection Algorithms
* Node Embeddings
* Similarity Algorithms
