= 2. Algorithm Tuning

Which is a valid consideration for setting the `embeddingDimension` tuning parameter?

* [ ] The number of nodes in the graph.  Generally larger graphs need larger embedding vectors to capture the graph structure
* [ ] Processing time and memory considerations.  Smaller embeddings take less time to compute and have a smaller memory footprint
* [ ] The accuracy/completeness needed in downstream analytics that use the embeddings.  Larger embeddings tend to estimate the graph structure more accurately
* [x] All the above
