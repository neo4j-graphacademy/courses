= Shortest Path

What is the shortest path between 'Kevin Bacon' and 'Peta Wilson'?

You can use the same projection and a similar query to the previous lesson to find the answer.

You will need to:

. Create a projection (or use the same one as the previous lesson) of `Actor` and `Movie` nodes and `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships.
. Create a query that matches the 2 `Actor` nodes and uses `gds.shortestPath.dijkstra.stream` function to find the shortest path
. Count how many relationships there are between the source and target nodes.

Enter the number of relationship hops between 'Kevin Bacon' and 'Peta Wilson':

.Hint
====
This is the Cypher you used in the previous lesson to find the shortest path between Kevin Bacon and Denzel Washington.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
// Create projection
CALL gds.graph.project('proj',
    ['Person','Movie'],
    {
        ACTED_IN:{orientation:'UNDIRECTED'},
        DIRECTED:{orientation:'UNDIRECTED'}
    }
);

// Find shortest path
MATCH (kevin:Actor{name : 'Kevin Bacon'})
MATCH (denzel:Actor{name : 'Denzel Washington'})

CALL gds.shortestPath.dijkstra.stream(
    'proj', 
    {
        sourceNode:kevin, 
        TargetNode:denzel
    }
)

YIELD sourceNode, targetNode, path
RETURN sourceNode, targetNode, nodes(path) as path;
----

There is a path consisting of four relationships between Kevin Bacon and Denzel Washington.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
You will need to create a graph projection, that includes the `Person` and `Movie` nodes and the `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.project('proj',
    ['Person','Movie'],
    {
        ACTED_IN:{orientation:'UNDIRECTED'},
        DIRECTED:{orientation:'UNDIRECTED'}
    }
);
----

Then you can use a similar query to the one used in the previous lesson to find the shortest path between Kevin Bacon and Peta Wilson.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (kevin:Actor{name : 'Kevin Bacon'})
MATCH (peta:Actor{name : 'Peta Wilson'})

CALL gds.shortestPath.dijkstra.stream(
    'proj', 
    {
        sourceNode:kevin, 
        TargetNode:peta
    }
)

YIELD sourceNode, targetNode, path
RETURN sourceNode, targetNode, nodes(path) as path;
----

The answer is the number of relationships in the path.
There are *6* relationships between Kevin Bacon and Peta Wilson.
