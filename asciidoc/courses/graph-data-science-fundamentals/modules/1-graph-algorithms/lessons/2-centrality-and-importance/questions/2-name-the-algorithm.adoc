= 2. Name the Algorithm

Which centrality algorithm is based solely on a count of relationships for each node

* [x] degree centrality
* [ ] pageRank
* [ ] HITS
* [ ] eigenvector centrality

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The number of relationships into or out of a relationship can also be referred to as a _degree_ count.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The **degree centrality** algorithm is a measure of centrality that calculates the importance of a node in a network based on the number of direct connections it has. It quantifies the number of edges connected to a node, indicating its level of influence or prominence within the network.
