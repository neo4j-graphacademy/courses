= 2. Name the Algorithm

Which Similarity algorithm can be used to find node pairs based off of node properties, including properties that were assigned from other graph algorithms like embeddings or community sizes?

* [ ] Cosine
* [ ] Node Similarity
* [x] K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* [ ] Dijkstra Source-Target

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The algorithm you are looking for uses nodes connected to a source node, in other words its _neighbors_, to compute simularity.

.Solution
====
The answer is **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**.  You can link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/knn/[Read more about the kNN algorithm in the GDS documentation^].
