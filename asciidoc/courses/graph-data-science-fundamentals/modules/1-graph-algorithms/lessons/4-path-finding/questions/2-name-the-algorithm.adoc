= 2. Name the Algorithm

Which Path finding algorithm can be used to identify the top 10 shortest path between two nodes?

* [ ] Apass:[* ]
* [x] Yen’s Algorithm
* [ ] Delta-Stepping
* [ ] Dijkstra Source-Target

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
__Yen's algorithm__ is a graph algorithm that efficiently finds multiple alternative shortest paths between a pair of nodes by iteratively removing edges from the current shortest path and recalculating the next shortest path.
