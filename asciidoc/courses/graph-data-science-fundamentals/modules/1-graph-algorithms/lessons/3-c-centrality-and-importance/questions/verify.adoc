You will need to create a graph projection using the `gds.graph.project()` procedure.
The graph should include `Movie` and `Actor` Nodes with the `DIRECTED` relationship type.


Here is the Cypher to create the projection.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'actor-directors',    // Projection name
    ['Actor', 'Movie'],  // Labels
    'DIRECTED'            // Relationship type
)
----

Next, you will need to run the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/2.4/algorithms/degree-centrality/[degree centrality algorithm^] using the `gds.degree.stream()` procedure.

.Solution
====
**Woody Allen** has directed the most movies in our database.  To calculate this, you will need to create a Cypher projection.

If you haven't already done so, create the graph projection:

.Create the Projection
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'actor-directors',    // Projection name
    ['Actor', 'Movie'],  // Labels
    'DIRECTED'            // Relationship type
)
----

Next, run the degree centrality algorithm on the projected graph using the `gds.degree.stream()` procedure.

.Run the degree centrality algorithm
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.degree.stream('actor-directors')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score AS movies
ORDER BY movies DESC, name DESC
