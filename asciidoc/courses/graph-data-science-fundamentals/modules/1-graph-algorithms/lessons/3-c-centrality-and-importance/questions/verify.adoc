= Which actor has _directed_ the most movies?

Use the Neo4j Browser window to the right of the screen to run GDS calls and enter the answer in the box below.

You will need to:
. Create a graph projection using the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project/[`gds.graph.project()^]` procedure.
. Include `Movie` and `Actor` nodes with the `DIRECTED` relationship type.
. Run the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/2.4/algorithms/degree-centrality/[degree centrality algorithm^] on the projected graph using the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/degree-centrality/#algorithms-degree-centrality-syntax[`gds.degree.stream()^]` procedure.
. Order the results to determine which *actor* has directed the most *movies*.

Enter the name of the actor (the answer is case sensitive):

input::answer[]

* [x] Woody Allen

.Hint
====
In the previous lesson, you used the following cypher to find the actors who have acted in the most movies:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'proj', 
  ['Actor','Movie'], 
  'ACTED_IN'
  );

CALL gds.degree.stream('proj')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN 
  gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS actorName, 
  score AS numberOfMoviesActedIn
ORDER BY numberOfMoviesActedIn DESCENDING, actorName LIMIT 5
----

You can modify this to use the `DIRECTED` relationship to find actors who have directed the most films.

.Solution
====
**Woody Allen** has directed the most movies in the database.  To calculate this, you will need to create a graph projection.

.Create the Projection
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'actor-directors',    // Projection name
    ['Actor', 'Movie'],  // Labels
    'DIRECTED'            // Relationship type
)
----

Next, run the degree centrality algorithm on the projected graph using the `gds.degree.stream()` procedure.

.Run the degree centrality algorithm
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.degree.stream('actor-directors')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN 
  gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, 
  score AS movies
ORDER BY movies DESC
