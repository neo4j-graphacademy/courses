= 1. Algorithm Purpose

What do community detection algorithms primarily accomplish? Select the best answer.

* [x] Detect how groups of nodes cluster together to form communities and strength of such clustering in the graph
* [ ] Find shortest paths between multiple nodes to identify communities
* [ ] Identify similar node pairs across the graph to define communities
* [ ] Compute low-dimensional representation of nodes in the graph that can be used downstream to detect communities of nodes in the graph

.Hint
====
A cluster of common nodes could also be described as a _community_.
