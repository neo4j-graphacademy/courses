= 2. Name the Algorithm

Which of the below community detection algorithms is focused on deterministically partitioning the graph into sets of disjoint nodes such that no path exists between sets?

* [ ] Louvain
* [ ] Label Propagation
* [ ] Triangle Counting
* [x] Weakly Connected Components

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The algorithm aims to identify nodes with a _lower_ number of connections.
