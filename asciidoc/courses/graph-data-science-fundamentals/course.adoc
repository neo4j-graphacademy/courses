== Course Description

In this course, we cover the high level concepts that a Data Scientist needs to know to conduct analytics with the Neo4j Graph Data Science library (GDS).
We cover the range of graph algorithms and machine learning operations available in GDS with examples of how to use them on real data.


The course automatically creates a new `movie recommendations` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.


=== Prerequisites
