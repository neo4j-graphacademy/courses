You must set up a development environment to run the code examples and exercises.

include::../../../../../../shared/courses/codespace/get-started.adoc[]

[%collapsible]
.Develop on your local machine
====
You will need link:https://python.org[Python] installed and the ability to install packages using `pip`.

You may want to set up a virtual environment using link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[`venv`^] or link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[`virtualenv`^] to keep your dependencies separate from other projects.

Clone the link:{repository-link}[github.com/neo4j-examples/python-driver-examples] repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-examples/python-driver-examples
----

Install the required packages using `pip`:

[source,bash]
----
cd python-driver-examples
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

You do not need to create a Neo4j database as you will use the provided sandbox instance.
====

== Setup the environment

Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`.
Fill in the required values.

[source]
.Create a .env file
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/.env.example[]
----

Update the Neo4j sandbox connection details:

NEO4J_URI:: [copy]#neo4j://{instance-ip}:{instance-boltPort}#
NEO4J_USERNAME:: [copy]#{instance-username}#
NEO4J_PASSWORD:: [copy]#{instance-password}#

== Test your setup

You can test your setup by running `genai-fundamentals/test_environment.py` - this will attempt to set up your environment variables and connect to the Neo4j sandbox.

You will see an `OK` message if you have set up your environment correctly. If any tests fail, check the contents of the `.env` file.

== Examples

The repository contains several examples to help you get started with using Python and Neo4j.

* connect.py - Connect to a Neo4j Graph Database
* run_cypher.py - Run a Cypher statement
* create_data.py - Read data from a CSV file and create nodes and relationships
* transaction.py - Execute cypher in a transaction
* export_to_dataframe.py - Export data to a Pandas DataFrame

== Lesson Summary

You setup a Python development environment.
