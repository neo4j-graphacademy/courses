== Agregating Data

You can aggregate data in Neo4j by using function as part of the `RETURN` clause. 

This allows you to perform calculations on your data, such as counting, summing, or averaging values.

[.slide]
== Count

With the Cypher `count()` function, you can perform a count of properties, nodes, relationships, paths, or rows during query processing. 

This query counts the number of movies in the database:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN count(m) 
----

[.slide.discrete]
== Count
Returning multiple values that contain a count will return a single row with the count of each value.

This query returns the number of movies in each genre:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
RETURN g.name AS genre, count(m) AS numMovies
----

[.slide.discrete]
== Count

You can order the results on aggregated values.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
RETURN g.name AS genre, count(m) AS numMovies
ORDER BY numMovies DESC
----

[.slide]
== Sum

You can sum values using the `sum()` function.

What is the total revenue of all movies in the database?

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN sum(m.revenue)
----

[.slide.discrete]
== Sum

This query finds the most profitable actors by grouping movie revenue by actor:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
RETURN 
    p.name AS actor, 
    sum(m.revenue) AS totalRevenue, 
ORDER BY totalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 10
----

[.slide]
== Average

You can use `avg()` to find the average value of a property.

Find the average rating of all movies in the database:

[source , cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[r:RATED]-()
RETURN 
    m.title AS movieTitle, 
    avg(r.rating) AS avgRating
----

[.slide.discrete]
== Average

Adding an `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clause will return the top 10 movies:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[r:RATED]-()
RETURN 
    m.title AS movieTitle, 
    avg(r.rating) AS avgRating
ORDER BY avgRating DESC
LIMIT 10
----
