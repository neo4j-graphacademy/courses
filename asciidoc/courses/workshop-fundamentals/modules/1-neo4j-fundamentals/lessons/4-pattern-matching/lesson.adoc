== Patterns

Cypher is a **declarative** query language that allows you to identify **patterns** in your data using an **ASCII-art style syntax** consisting of **brackets**, **dashes** and **arrows**.

This pattern finds all nodes with a label of `Person`, that have an _outgoing_ `ACTED_IN` relationship to a node with a label of `:Movie`:

image::{image-path}/pattern-1.png[(p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)]

If you break this pattern down, it contains nodes, relationships and variables.

[.slide]
== Nodes

Nodes in the pattern are expressed with parentheses - `( )`

[.slide.discrete]
== Labels
Inside the parentheses you can define information about the node, for example the label(s) or properties the node should contain.

image::{image-path}/pattern-3.png[:Person and :Movie highlighted]

Labels are prefixed a colon - `(:Label)`

The pattern contains two nodes `(:Person)` and `(:Movie)`.

[.slide]
== Relationships

Relationships are drawn with two dashes (`--`) and an arrow to specify the direction (`<` or `>`) - `- ->`.

[.slide.discrete]
== Relationship types

Relationship information is contained within square brackets -`[ ]`.

image::{image-path}/pattern-5.png[:ACTED_IN highlighted]

The relationship type is prefixed with a colon - `[:TYPE]`

The pattern contains one relationship `-[:ACTED_IN]->` between `(:Person)` and `(:Movie)` nodes.

[.slide.discrete]
== Recap
To recap, this pattern: 

image::{image-path}/pattern-1.png[(p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)]

Finds `(:Person)` nodes, that have an `-[:ACTED_IN]->` relationship, to `(:Movie)` nodes.

[.slide]
== Variables

The nodes and relationships in the pattern are assigned to variables.

image::{image-path}/pattern-6.png[p, r, n highlighted]

These variables are positioned before the information about the node or relationship.

* `p` - the `:Person` node
* `r` - the `:ACTED_IN` relationship
* `m` - the `:Movie` node

[.slide]
== MATCH-ing

The `MATCH` clause is used to find patterns in the data.

Review this Cypher statement, you should be able to identify:

. The pattern being used.
. A `WHERE` clause which filters the results.
. The variables used in the `RETURN` clause.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p,r,m
----

[.slide.discrete]
== MATCH-ing

Patterns can be as simple as a single node, or contain multiple relationships.

This example finds all people who have acted in movies with 'Tom Hanks', and uses the `RETURN` clause to define the properties.

[source,cypher]
.Actors who acted with Tom Hanks
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p2.name AS actor, m.title AS movie, r.role AS role
----

The pattern uses the ACTED_IN relationship to find the movies Tom Hanks is in, and then a second time to find the actors in the movies with Tom Hanks, 

The keyword `AS` is used to define an alias, for example, the property `p2.name` will be returned as `actor`.
