== Using Cypher

You can use the query language Cypher to interact with a Neo4j graph database.

You are you going to use Cypher to explore a graph database containing: 

* Movies, actors and directors from link:https://www.themoviedb.org/[The Movie Database (TMDB)^].
* Movie ratings by users of the website.

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== Person and Movie Nodes

[.col]
====
The graph contains `Person` and `Movie` nodes.

Each of `Person` node may have one or more outgoing `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships to a `Movie` node.
====

[.col]

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== Genres

[.col]
====
Movies are categorized into one or more genres, for example, Adventure, Animation, and, Comedy.

`Movie` nodes are connected to `Genre` nodes by an `IN_GENRE` relationship.
====

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== User ratings

[.col]
====
The graph also contains `User` nodes and over 100,000 movies ratings.

`User` nodes are connected to `Movie` nodes by a `RATED` relationship.
====

== Explore the Graph

GraphAcademy has created a link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com[Neo4j database instance^] for you.

Run the following Cypher statement to find a `Person` node with the `name` attribute 'Tom Hanks'.

[source,cypher]
.Tom Hanks
----
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE n.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN n
----

[.slide]
== People

Each `Person` node has an unique `name` property, as well as other properties such as `bio` and `born`.

View the node properties by selecting the node.

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== Expand Relationships

[.col]
====
Expand the node's relationships by doubling click the node.

You will see that there are `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships to `Movie` nodes.
====

[.slide.col-2]
== Movies

[.col]
====
Each `Movie` node has a unique `title` property, as well as other properties including `plot`, `released` and `url`.

Run the following Cypher statement to find the movie 'Toy Story' and the people who acted in the movie.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
RETURN m, r, p
----
====

[.col]
====
The query uses the `[ACTED_IN]` relationship to find `Person` nodes who have a connection to the `Movie` node.

====

[.slide.col-2]
== Genres

[.col]
====
This Cypher statement uses the `[IN_GENRE]` relationship to find related `Genre` nodes.

[source,cypher]
.Movie Genres
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[r:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
RETURN m, r, g
----
====

[.col]
image::{image-path}/toy-story-genres.svg[The Toy Story Movie node and Genre nodes connected by the IN_GENRE relationship]

[.slide.discrete]
== Tabular Data
You can return tabular data by including the properties of the nodes.

[source,cypher]
.List Movie Genres
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[r:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
RETURN m.title, g.name
----

[.slide.discrete]
== Experiment
Experiment with these queries. Try and find different movies and people, for example, the `Movie` node "Babe" or the `Person` node "Emma Stone".

[.slide]
== User Ratings

Review this Cypher statement before running it and predict what graph will be returned.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE u.name = "Mr. Jason Love"
RETURN u, r, m
----

[.transcript-only]
====
[%collapsible]
.Click here to reveal the result
=====
The statement returns all the movies that have been rated by the user "Mr. Jason Love".

image::{image-path}/user-ratings.svg[A single User node connected to Movie nodes by RATED relationships.]
=====
====

[.slide.discrete.col-2]
== User Ratings

[.col]
====
The **rating** the user has given for the movie is stored as a property on the `RATED` relationship.

Run this Cypher statement to return a table of movie ratings:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE u.name = "Mr. Jason Love"
RETURN u.name, r.rating, m.title
----

The properties are defined in the `RETURN`, for example `u.name` will return the `name` property of the `User` node.
====

[.col]
====
[cols="3",options=header]
|===
|u.name|r.rating|m.title
|"Mr. Jason Love"|3.0|"Houseguest"
|"Mr. Jason Love"|3.0|"Ed Wood"
|"Mr. Jason Love"|4.0|"Little Women"
|"Mr. Jason Love"|4.0|"Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"
|"Mr. Jason Love"|5.0|"Circle of Friends"
