[NOTE]
This video was recorded using an earlier version of the sandbox (Neo4j 4.x).
You are using a Neo4j 5.4 sandbox for this course.
The last code example has changed to add a WITH clause for sum().

== Using `sum()` to add values

Cypher `sum()` returns the sum of all values retrieved during aggregation.
The values must be numeric types or durations.
If the numeric values are a combination of integers and floats, the result returned is a float.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.year = 2000
RETURN sum(m.revenue) as GrossRevenue
----

Notice that for this Cypher code, the Movie node data is aggregated to create the sum of the revenue property values.

In this query, the value returned is of type float since at least one of the values being totaled is of type float:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH [1, 1.5,2] as Nums
UNWIND Nums AS  x
RETURN sum(x)
----

You  cannot add up the elements of a list without using `UNWIND` to extract each element, then use `sum()` to total them.

Here is another example:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (:Movie {title: 'Toy Story'})-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)<-[:IN_GENRE]-(m)
WHERE m.imdbRating IS NOT NULL
WITH g.name AS Genre,
count(m) AS MoviesInCommon,
sum(m.imdbRating) AS Total
RETURN Genre, MoviesInCommon,
Total/MoviesInCommon AS Score
ORDER By Score DESC
----

In this code we retrieve the number of movies Toy Story  has in common with each genre name.
For each movie we aggregate to create a total for the imdbRating for each movie.
Then we return the genre name, the number of movies in common, and the average score.
Here we determine the average by dividing the sum by the number of movies.
You will learn about the Cypher `avg()` function in the next lesson.

=== Using `sum()` for durations

In addition to aggregating property values for nodes retrieved as a sum, you can also aggregate durations and total them.
A Neo4j duration type is used to calculate the amount of time between two dates or times.

Here is an example.

// video redo
// need to re-record this with V5 version of code
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)
WHERE
a.born IS NOT NULL
AND a.name STARTS WITH 'Tom'
WITH count(a) AS NumActors, collect(duration.between(date(a.born), date())) AS Ages
UNWIND Ages AS x
WITH NumActors, sum(x) AS TotalAges
RETURN  TotalAges, TotalAges/NumActors
----

In this query, we retrieve all Actor nodes with a name that begins with "Tom".
We collect the durations between the birth date and now.
We then `UNWIND` the list of durations to aggreate the values using `sum()`.
We return the sum, but we can also use the calcuated sum to return the average age.

== Summary

In this lesson, you reviewed and learned how aggregation is used to sum data in your Cypher queries.
In the next Challenge, you will create a query  that totals data.
