Your query should start with:

----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]-(m:Movie)
WHERE u.name = 'Angela Thompson'
WITH count(m) AS NumMovies, collect(duration.between(datetime({epochseconds:r.timestamp}), date(m.released))) AS ReviewPeriods
----

Then add code to `UNWIND` the list and sum the durations.

You will also calculate the average based on the total divided by NumMovies.
