== How `min()`/`max()` works

Unlike the aggregation functions `sum()` and `avg()`, the min and max functions evaluate values that could represent mixed types.
The types could be numeric, strings, or lists.
Like `sum()` and `avg()`, null elements are ignored.

=== Mixed element types

A numeric value is always greater than a string or list value.
This query returns 2 because it is the greatest numeric value.

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND [[2],0,"a",2,[1]] AS x
RETURN max(x)
----

String values are always greater than a list value.
Because strings are always greater than lists, this query returns "b"

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND [["a"],"a","b",[1]] AS x
RETURN max(x)
----

=== List element comparisons

If lists are being compared, the elements are compared in the order in the list.
This query returns [1,3,5] because the element comparison of the second element is greatest and no other elements in the list are compared.

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND [[1,2,12], [1,3,5]] AS x
RETURN max(x)
----

=== Using `min()`/`max()` effectively

Because `min()` and `max()` use eager aggregation in their query plans, you should  profile your queries and work to improve their performance.

Here is an example where we  determine the maximum top vote value using `max()` and then use this value to find the movie:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WITH max(m.imdbVotes) as topVotes
MATCH (m:Movie) where m.imdbVotes = topVotes
RETURN m.title, m.imdbVotes
----

Using `max()` may not be the best solution. This query can be improved:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.imdbVotes IS NOT NULL
RETURN m.title, m.imdbVotes ORDER by m.imdbVotes DESC LIMIT 1
----

=== Use of indexes

If the property that you are comparing with `min()` or `max()` has an index on it, the index is used to return the value which is very efficient.
In our graph the Movie node has an index on imdbRating so this query is very fast because the index is used to determine min/max, rather than aggregating the property values.

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN max(m.imdbRating)
----

== Summary

In this lesson, you reviewed and learned how minimum and maximum values are determined during a query.
In the next Challenge, you will create a query  that uses `min()` to find the minimum value.
