= Working with Lists
:sandbox: true

//[.transcript]
== Module overview

Lists are the most common structure you will work with to aggregate data.
As you learned in the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals Course^], you can store properties as lists and you can also create lists during your query.
Lists can contain property values, nodes, relationships, and even paths in the graph.

In this module you will learn more about working with lists:

* Functions that return a single value
* Functions that return lists
* Element type transformations
* List selection predicate functions
* List comprehension
