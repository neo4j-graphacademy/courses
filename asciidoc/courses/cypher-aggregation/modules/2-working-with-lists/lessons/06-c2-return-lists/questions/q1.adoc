= Reviewed Same Movies

Let's focus on the user named Catherine Trujillo.

Write a query that returns the names of other Users who reviewed the same movies.

Try using a path to perform the retrieval and then use `nodes()` to return the User nodes in the paths.

For example, start with this `MATCH` clause:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (u:User {name: 'Catherine Trujillo'})-[:RATED*2]-()
----

This will return all paths where the nodes are 2 hops away from Catherine Trujillo. That is, it will retrieve all Users who reviewed the same movies as Catherine.

Assuming User names are unique, and Catherine is not one of the Users, how many Users are returned?

Only return unique User nodes and do not return the node for Catherine Trujillo
