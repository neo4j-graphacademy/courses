== Using `range()`

The `range()` function is useful when you need to create a list of numbers.

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN range(0,100,5)
----

Note that you can also leave off the step value as it defaults to 1.

The initial value is 0, the ending value is 100, and the optional step is 5.

Generating a range list is useful when you create nodes with an id.

Here is an example where we use values from 1 to 100 to create Order nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND range(1, 100) AS i
MERGE (:Order { number: i })
// to undo this:
// MATCH (o:Order) DETACH DELETE o
----

=== Reversing the elements of a list

You use `reverse()` to reverse the elements of a list:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)--(m:Movie)
WHERE m.year < 1910
WITH a, count (m) AS NumMovies
WITH NumMovies, [a.name, NumMovies] AS Stats ORDER BY NumMovies
WITH collect(Stats) as AllStats
return AllStats, reverse(AllStats)
----

. This query finds all actors who acted in movies released before 1910.
. For each actor, it counts the number of movies.
. It then creates a list containing the actor name and number of movies, and it orders the list by the number of movies.
. It then creates a list of all the lists collected named AllStats.
. Finally, it returns the AllStats list and the reverse of it.

=== Returning all but the first element of a list

In a previous lesson, you learned that `head()` returns the first element of a list.
`tail()` returns the remaining elements of the list.

Here is an example:

// reco db change impact
// results returned in video will look different

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE date(m.released).year = 2000
WITH m ORDER BY date(m.released)
WITH collect(m) AS Movies
RETURN head(Movies).title AS FirstTitle, head(Movies).released AS FirstDate, size(tail(Movies)) AS SizeOfTail,
tail(Movies)[-1].title AS LastTitle, tail(Movies)[-1].released AS LastDate
----

The Movie nodes are collected for the year 2000 and ordered by the released property.
The first title and released properties are returned for the Movies list.
The size of the tail of the Movies list is returned. The Movies list has 287 elements and the tail has 286 elements.
We use the index[-1] to return the last title and released property from the tail.

=== Using `split()` to create a list from a string

A very common operation that you may do when reading CSV files for importing data into the graph is to transform a string encountered in the CSV file into a list.
You can use the `split()` function to separate the values in a string where you specify the separator character.
The string is then used to create a list, based upon the specified separator character.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/MovieDataUnclean.csv'
AS row
WITH
row.title AS Title,
row.languages AS Field,
split(row.languages,"|") AS FieldList
RETURN Title, Field, FieldList LIMIT 10
----

The "|" character is specified as the separator character. `split()` turns the strings into lists.

=== Creating a list of nodes

You can use `nodes()` to extract a list of nodes in a given path.
This function is useful if you want to get nodes in a variable length path.

Here is an example that you saw earlier in this course:

[source,cypher]
----
// Movies in all paths that begin with Elvis and end with an Actor that are 4 hops away from Elvis
MATCH path = (p:Person {name: 'Elvis Presley'})-[*4]-(a:Actor)
WITH nodes(path) AS n
UNWIND n AS x
WITH x WHERE x:Movie
RETURN DISTINCT x.title
----

`nodes()` returns all nodes in the path. We then are only interested in the nodes with the Movie label.

Here is another example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
MATCH path = (m)-[:ACTED_IN*1..6]-()
WHERE last(nodes(path)).name IS NOT NULL
RETURN last(nodes(path)).name AS LastNode, length(path) AS HopsAway order by length(path)
----

This query is used to get nodes that are up to 6 hops away from the Movie, Toy Story.
It does a check to make sure that the name property in the node list is not null because the node label could be a Movie, and we are only interested in Person nodes that have a name property.
We return the name of the last node in the list and its distance from the Toy Story node.

In this lesson, you about the Cypher functions that return lists.
In the next challenges, you will create queries that use Cypher functions that return lists.
