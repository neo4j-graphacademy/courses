== List functions that return a single value

Cypher has a number of scalar functions that operate on a list to return a single value.
The single value could be a string, number, or even another list.

=== Size of a list

The most-used scalar function on a list is one that you have already seen, `size()` that returns the number of elements in a list.
If many cases, it is used to limit the number of results returned.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WITH p, collect (m.title) AS MovieTitles
WITH p, MovieTitles, size(MovieTitles) AS NumMovies
WHERE NumMovies >= 20
RETURN p.name AS Actor, NumMovies, MovieTitles ORDER BY NumMovies
----

This query returns the names of actors who acted in more than 20 movies by creating the list for each actor, then filtering the list by the size.
This query also uses the value of `size()` to order the results returned.

=== First/last element of a list

You use the `head()` function to return the first element of a list.

// reco db change impact
// results in video will look different

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE  date(m.released).year = 2000
WITH m ORDER BY date(m.released)
WITH collect(m) AS Movies
WITH head(Movies) as First
RETURN First.title AS FirstTitle, First.released AS FirstDate
----

This query retrieves all movies for the year 2000 and adds them to a list.
Because the list is ordered by the released property of a Movie node, we can find the first element of the list of nodes, First.
Then we return the value of the title and the value of the release date.

You use the `last()` function to return the last element of a list.

// reco db change impact
// results in video will look different

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) where date(m.released).year = 2000
WITH m ORDER BY date(m.released)
WITH collect(m) as Movies
WITH last(Movies) as Last
RETURN Last.title as LastTitle, Last.released AS LastDate
----

=== Using `reduce()`

Cypher has a `reduce()` function that enables you to calculate a value where you specify the initial value and apply a formula or calculation using the initial value on every element in the list.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE date(m.released).year = 2000
WITH collect(m.revenue) AS Revenues
WITH Revenues, reduce(t=0, r IN Revenues | t + r) AS TotalRevenue
RETURN TotalRevenue, size(Revenues) AS TotalMovies
----

This query retrieves all movie revenue values for movies released in 2000 and creates the Revenues list.
It then uses `reduce()` with a starting value of 0. Finally, it adds each element to return the total of all elements in the list.

Here is another example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Toy Story'
WITH  collect(r.rating) AS Ratings
WITH Ratings, reduce(Rating = 0, x IN Ratings | Rating + x) AS TotalRatings
RETURN round(TotalRatings/size(Ratings),1)
----

In this example we are totaling the ratings for the movie, Toy Story and then returning the average by dividing by the size of the list.
You will learn about the Cypher `avg()` function later in this course.

The `reduce()` function can be used for any type of calculation.

Here is another example where we use `reduce()` to flatten a list of lists:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] AS StartingList
RETURN reduce(Calc = [], r IN StartingList | Calc + r) AS FlattenedList
----

The initial value is an empty list.
Each element in the list is added to the initial value, Calc.

== Summary

In this lesson, you about the Cypher functions used to return a single value from a list.
In the next Challenge, you will create some queries to use these Cypher scalar list functions.
