= Understanding Aggregation in Cypher
:sandbox: true

//[.transcript]
== Module overview

Aggregation in Cypher means that during a query, data retrieve is collected or counted.
There are some best practices for aggregating data during your query that you can better understand with examples and and explanation of how the query works at runtime.

In this module, you will learn how these types of queries work at runtime:

** Using `collect()`
** Using `count()`
** Using list comprehension
** Using pattern comprehension
** Using grouping keys

== Data model for this course

This course uses the movie dataset for all the queries you will be running and writing.
This is the same dataset that will be used for the application development courses in GraphAcademy.

Here is the graph data model:

You can view the data model in the sandbox to the right by executing this query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization()
----

The node labels for the graph include:

* Person
* Actor
* Director
* Movie
* Genre
* User

The relationships for the graph include:

* ACTED_IN (with an  optional role property)
* DIRECTED (with an optional role property)
* RATED (with rating  and timestamp properties)
* IN_GENRE

Also notice that the nodes have a number of properties, along with the type of data that will be used for each property.
It is important that you understand the property types defined in the data model.

You can view the property types for nodes in the graph by executing this query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.nodeTypeProperties()
----

You can view the property types for relationships in the graph by executing this query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.relTypeProperties()
----
