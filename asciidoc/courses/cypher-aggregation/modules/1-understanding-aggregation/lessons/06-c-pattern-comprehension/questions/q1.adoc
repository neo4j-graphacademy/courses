= Younger actors

Here is a query that returns the actors who acted in movies between the years 2000 and 2005.
The query returns actors born on or after 1980:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WHERE 2000 <= m.year <= 2005 AND a.born.year >= 1980
RETURN a.name AS Actor, a.born AS Born,
collect(DISTINCT m.title) AS Movies ORDER BY Actor
----

This query returns 413 Actor rows.
Using this as a starting point, rewrite the above query to use pattern comprehension:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)
WHERE a.born.year >= 1980
// Add a WITH clause to create the list using pattern comprehension
// filter the result of the pattern comprehension to return only lists with elements
// return the Actor, Born, and Movies
----

Your result should return the same number of Actor rows which is 413.

For this query,  size()  filters out actors who have no movies in that timeframe which should be minimal so this is a reasonable solution.

.Hint
====

Add a `WITH` clause to create the list using pattern comprehension of actors who acted in movies released between 2000 and 2005.

Use a `WHERE` clause to test the size of the list to be > 0.

Do **not** specify the Movie label in the pattern - this will yield better performance.

The number of Actor rows returned should be 413.
