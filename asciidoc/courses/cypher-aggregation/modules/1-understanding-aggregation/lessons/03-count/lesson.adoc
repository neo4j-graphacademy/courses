== Using `count()` to aggregate data

With the Cypher `count()` function,  you can perform a count of  properties, nodes, relationships, paths, or rows during query processing.
When you aggregate in a Cypher statement, the query must process all patterns in the `MATCH` clause to
complete the aggregation to either return results or perform the next part of the query.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE a.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN a.name AS ActorName,
count(*) AS NumMovies
----

This query returns the number of movies Tom Hanks acted in. `count(*)` returns the number of rows retrieved in the query.
What we return to the client is the name of the actor and the count of the rows.

Here is another example:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person)
RETURN a.name AS ActorName,
d.name AS DirectorName,
count(*) AS NumMovies
ORDER BY NumMovies DESC
----

Here we are returning the actor name and director name pairs and aggregating on the number of rows for each pair.
That is, the number of movies for each actor/director pair.

And if we wanted to collect the titles of the movies, it would use the same type of eager aggregation:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person)
RETURN a.name AS ActorName,
d.name AS DirectorName,
count(*) AS NumMovies, collect(m.title) AS Movies
ORDER BY NumMovies DESC
----

=== Using `count()` on property values

You can count the number of properties to see if there are nodes that do not have a value.
Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN count(p) , count(p.born)
----

In this query, we return the number of Person nodes and the number of born properties in these nodes.
We see that these numbers differ so we know that there are Person nodes that do not have the born property in the grapn.


=== Counting for the next part of the query

Here is an example where we start the query processing by retrieving all actors and their movies.
During the query processing, we want to only return actors that have 2 movies.
We use `count()` to further filter the query.

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WITH  a, count(*) AS NumMovies
// can add Movies to also create the list of movies
//, collect(m.title) AS Movies
WHERE NumMovies = 2
RETURN a.name AS Actor
//, Movies
----

Notice that when this query executes, is does an EagerAggregation for the `count()` before the filter step.

=== Counting specific nodes

In addition to counting the number of rows returned, you can also count specific nodes retrieved in the query.
In this query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Elvis Presley'})-[]-(m:Movie)-[]-(a:Actor)
RETURN count(*), count(m), count (a)
----

All count values are the same. The total number of rows is 34.
The total number of Actor nodes and Movie nodes is also 34 because the nodes are repeated in each row.

You specify `DISTINCT` so that the exact number of movies and actors are counted with no duplicates:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Elvis Presley'})-[]-(m:Movie)-[]-(a:Actor)
RETURN count(*), count(DISTINCT m), count (DISTINCT a)
----

This query returns the total count of rows returned (34), the number of distinct movies (11) and the number of distinct actors (33).

In this lesson, you reviewed and learned more about aggregating data  using `count()` in your Cypher queries.
In the next Challenge, you will create a query  to aggregate using `count()`.
