== Course description

In this course you will learn what aggregation is in Cypher and how it behaves at runtime.
You will also review and learn more about the Cypher syntax and functions for working with lists.
You will see and run example code that uses the most widely-used aggregation  and list functions in Cypher.

* Profile and explain how aggregation works at runtime
** Using `collect()`
** Using `count()`
** Using pattern comprehension
* Work with lists
** Functions that return a single value
** Functions that return lists
** Element type transformations
** List selection predicates
** List comprehension
* Use aggregating functions
