== Course Description

In this course, we walk through the steps to integrate Neo4j into your .NET project.

We will follow the steps to create an instance of the Neo4j .NET Driver, learn about sessions and transactions, and use that knowledge to build a REST API with link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0[ASP.NET Core^] that will work with a pre-built Single Page Application (SPA).

The course automatically creates a new `{usecase}` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase={usecase}[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.

=== Prerequisites

By taking this course, we assume that you have a working knowledge of C#, Nuget and the .NET ecosystem.
We also assume that you have at least a basic knowledge of Neo4j.

If you haven't already done so, we recommend that you also take the link:/courses/neo4j-fundamentals[Neo4j Fundamentals] course in order to gain a basic understanding of Neo4j and the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals[Cypher Fundamentals] to understand how to query Neo4j using Cypher.

=== Duration
