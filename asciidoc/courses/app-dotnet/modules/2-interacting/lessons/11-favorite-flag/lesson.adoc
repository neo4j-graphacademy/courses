= Adding The Favorite Flag

In the previous Challenge, we hardcoded a `favorite` property on the return to the calls in the `FavoriteService`.
We did this because we could guarantee the value based on the query being executed.
This won't be possible in the `MovieService`.

Your next challenge is to modify the link:{repository-blob}/main/Neoflix/Services/MovieService.cs[`MovieService`^] to dynamically determine whether a movie is on the current user's My Favorite List.

This challenge has one part:

1. <<Finding Favorites>>

== Running Multiple Queries within a Transaction

So far, you have only used the `tx` Transaction within the Unit of Work to run a single query.

This will be fine for the majority of cases, but there may also be scenarios where more than one Query may be required.


=== User Favorites

One way that we could find the user's favorites would be to run a separate `MATCH` clause within the same query.

But as all of the routes that interact with the `MovieService` are used by both anonymous and logged in users, this could add unwanted complexity to the service.

Instead, it would be cleaner to execute two separate queries within the same transaction; one query to fetch a list of the user's favorites, and another to retrieve a list of movies.

Fortunately, with only a few minor tweaks to the code, we can create a method that can be used to populate the `favorite` flag in the every other method in the `MovieService`.


== Creating a Reusable Method


At the bottom of the `MovieService`, a placeholder `GetUserFavoritesAsync()` method exists which is currently hardcoded to return an empty array.

[source,c#,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/Neoflix/Services/MovieService.cs[tag="getUserFavorites"]
----

The purpose of this method is to run a Cypher statement against the `Transaction` object passed as the first parameter, which will find all of the user's favorite movies and return a list of `tmdbId` properties.

Your challenge is to modify this method to retrieve that list of Movie ID's and then call this function from the Read Transaction in the `AllAsync()` method.


=== Finding Favorites

Modify the `GetUserFavoritesAsync()` method to run the following query against the `tx` parameter.

This query should only run if a user is logged in for the current request, and therefore the `userId` parameter is not `null`.

=== Adding the getUserFavorites call

Inside the `AllAsync()` method, we have used to just execute a single `tx.RunAsync()`.

Instead of returning the results directly, you'll need to add a call to `GetUserFavorites(tx, userId)` to get the list of favorite movies of the user, and then call the existing `tx.RunAsync` statement with the result of the `GetUserFavorites` function passed as an additional parameter `$favorites`.

=== Working Solution

If we take a look at the two versions of the `AllAsync()` method, not much has changed.
The `favorites` array has been passed through as a parameter to the query, and the query now uses the Cypher `IN` clause to check if the ID is included in the array.

== Module Summary

In this module, you have updated the project to read data from, and write data to Neo4j.
You have also learned about some of the considerations that we need to make when working with the Cypher type system in our Java application.

In the *Project Backlog* module, you will continue to implement the remaining missing pieces of functionality.
This isn't strictly required, but will be good practice for your development journey ahead.
