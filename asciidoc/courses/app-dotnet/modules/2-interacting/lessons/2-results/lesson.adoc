= Processing Results
:type: quiz
:order: 2

// The Neo4j .NET Driver provides you with two APIs for consuming results:

// * **Synchronous** API
// * **Asynchronous** API

Throughout this course, we will use the **Asynchronous** API to retreive and process results from Neo4j.
To use the  you will need to to define `async` methods and use the `await` keyword to await the results.

Results can also be retrieved synchronously by ommiting the `Async` suffix.


== Result Cursors

The `IResultCursor` implementation returned by calls to `session.RunAsync()` or `tx.RunAsync()` provides access to the result as an asynchronous stream of `IRecord` s along with additional meta data about the query and result.

The records in the result is lazily retrieved and could only be visited once in a sequential order.
A `Record` refers to the keyed set of values specified in the `RETURN` portion of the statement.

In the previous code block, the `ToListAsync()` method is called on the cursor implementation to convert all results returned by the Neo4j DBMS as a list.
The `Select()` method is then called to retrieve the `name` value returned in each Record.


Records can be consumed in order using a `while` loop, or more the commonly used approach is to use the `ToListAsync()` function as above, which will consume the results in order and return a set.

Where a singe result is expected, you can call the `SingleAsync()` function to retrieve the first record.
If zero, or more than one record are retrieve an error will be thrown.

=== Records

The `IRecord` interface provides access to an individual record returned by Neo4j.

The `.Keys` property provides the available keys for the record.
These relate to the aliases referenced in the `RETURN` clause of the Cypher statement.

You can use the square-bracket syntax to access a value, for example `row["movie"].As<INode>()` will access the `movie` item defined in the, cast as an implementation of the `INode` interface.






// A `Result` is an `Iterator<Record>` there are `stream()` and `list()` accessors for streaming and materialization/conversion.

=== Result Summary

The meta data `IResultCursor` accessed by calling `.Consume()` include:

* statistics on how many nodes and relationships were created, updated, or deleted as a result of the query,
* the query type
* database and server info
* query plan with and without profile
* notifications

You can find more detail in the https://neo4j.com/docs/api/dotnet-driver/current/html/17958e2b-d923-ab62-bb96-697556493c2e.htm[API docs for `IResultSummary`^]

For example, to get information about how long the query took to complete, you can use the following property:

Another interesting part of the summary is the `SummaryCounters` available via the `Counters` property, which has update counts about a write-statement's execution.
You can check via `counters.ContainsUpdates` if there were any updates.

You now have all the information required to send Cypher queries to Neo4j and consume the results.

Next, we will look at the Cypher Type System and some of the considerations that you need to make when working with values coming from Neo4j in your Java application.
