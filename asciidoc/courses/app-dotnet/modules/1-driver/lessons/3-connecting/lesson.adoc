This is your first challenge of this course.
Your challenge here is to modify the code to create a new instance of the Driver that can be used across the application.

As we discussed in the link:../1-about/[About the Driver lesson], it is best practice to create a single instance of the driver in our application per Neo4j cluster or DBMS.

In the `Neo4j` class inside `Neoflix/Neo4j.cs`, you will see an `InitDriverAsync()` method.

.Neo4j.cs
[source,c#,indent=0,role=nocopy]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/Neoflix/Neo4j.cs[tag=initDriver]
----

This method accepts the parameters required to create a new `Driver` instance with basic authentication.


== Challenge: Implement the initDriver function.

Your first challenge is to modify this method to create an instance of the driver and verify that the connection details are correct.

To do this, we will need to:

1. Install the `Neo4j.Driver` dependency.
2. Use the `GraphDatabase.Driver` from the dependency method to create a new Driver instance and assign it to the local `_driver` variable.
3. Call the `VerifyConnectivityAsync()` method on the newly created driver instance to check the connection details.


=== 1. Add the Neo4j.Driver Dependency

Firstly, run the following command in Visual Studio to install the `Neo4j.Driver` dependency.

.Installing through Visual Studio
[source,c#]
----
PM> Install-Package Neo4j.Driver
----

Alternatively, you can run the `dotnet add` command.


.Using the dotnet add Command
[source,sh]
----
dotnet add Neoflix package Neo4j.Driver
----



=== 2. Importing the Dependency

To include the Driver dependency in our module, you will add an `using` directive to the top of the file.
Copy and paste the following code into the top of link:{repository-blob}/main/Neoflix/Neo4j.cs[`main/Neoflix/Neo4j.cs`^].

[source,c#,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/Examples/Neo4jExamples/Program.cs[tag=import]
----


=== 3. Creating the Driver Instance

Create the driver instance by calling the `GraphDatabase.Driver()` method.

The first argument will be the `uri` passed as the first parameter.

To create an authentication token, call the  `AuthTokens.basic()` function with the `username` and `password` arguments passed to the method.

Assign the value returned by the  `GraphDatabase.Driver()` method to the `_driver` variable and call `_driver.verifyConnectivityAsync()` to verify connectivity

.Neo4j.cs
[source,c#,indent=0]
----
include::{repository-raw}/{branch}/Neoflix/Neo4j.cs[tag=initDriver]
----

If the connection cannot be made for any reason, call will fail with an Exception.
If this occurs, your application will be unable to communicate with Neo4j.
Manual investigation will be required to diagnose the issue.


If the connection has been successfully verified, it will return an instance of the driver.

== Lesson Summary

You have implemented the code to create a new driver instance with environment variables read from the `appsettings.json` file which verifies that the driver can connect to the DBMS before the application starts.

In the next module we will look at how to use the driver to query the DBMS.
