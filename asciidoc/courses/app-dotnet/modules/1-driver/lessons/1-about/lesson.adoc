= About the Driver
:type: quiz

In the link:/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] course, we cover how to query Neo4j using a language called Cypher.
To execute a Cypher statement against a Neo4j database you will use an object called a *Driver*.


// tag::driver[]
> The **Driver** object is a thread-safe, application-wide fixture from which all Neo4j interaction derives.
>
> The Driver API is **topology independent**, so you can run the same code against a *Neo4j cluster* or a *single DBMS*.

// end::driver[]

To connect to and query Neo4j from within a Java application, you use the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/dotnet[Neo4j .NET Driver^].

The Neo4j .NET Driver is one of five officially supported drivers, the others are Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go.
There are also a wide range of Community Drivers available for other languages including PHP and Ruby.

You should create a **single instance** of the Driver in your application per Neo4j cluster or DBMS, which can then be shared across your application.

== Installing the Driver

The Neo4j .NET Driver is distributed via the NuGet Gallery.
You can find the latest version of the driver by visiting link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/Neo4j.Driver/[https://www.nuget.org/packages/Neo4j.Driver/^].

To install the latest version of the driver using NuGet in Visual Studio, you can run the following command

.Installing through Visual Studio
[source,c#]
----
PM> Install-Package Neo4j.Driver
----

Alternatively, you can run the `dotnet add` command to add the dependency.


.Using the dotnet add Command
[source,sh]
----
dotnet add Neoflix package Neo4j.Driver
----

This will add a new entry to the `.csproj` file for your project

.The newly added package reference
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<PackageReference Include="Neo4j.Driver" Version="5.1.0" />
----

== Creating a Driver Instance

Each driver instance will connect to one DBMS, or Neo4j cluster, depending on the value provided in the connection string.

You will then use the `using` keyword to include the `Neo4j.Driver` namespace into your C# classes.

The static `GraphDatabase` class provides a `Driver` method for creating a new driver implementation.
The `Driver()` method requires two arguments:

1. **A connection string** for the Neo4j cluster or DBMS - for example `neo4j://localhost:7687` or `neo4j+s://_dbhash_.databases.neo4j.io:7687`
2. **An authentication token** - Neo4j supports basic username and password authentication, kerberos tokens or custom authentication.  You can create an authentication token by calling one of the static methods provided by `AuthTokens`.


Here is an example for how to create a driver instance:

.Creating a Driver Instance
[source,c#,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/Examples/Neo4jExamples/Program.cs[tag=import]
include::{repository-raw}/main/Examples/Neo4jExamples/Program.cs[tag=credentials,indent=0]
include::{repository-raw}/main/Examples/Neo4jExamples/Program.cs[tag=driver,indent=0]
----

The above example creates an _unencrypted_ connection to the Neo4j server at `localhost` on the default port number of `7687`.
The driver then attemps to authenticate against the server using a basic authentication with the username `neo4j` and password `letmein!`.


=== Verifying Connectivity

You can verify that the connection details used during driver instantiation are correct by calling the `verifyConnectivity()` function.
This function returns the Driver instance if the connection details are correct, or fails with a `Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized` Exception if a connection could not be made.

.Verify Connectivity
[source,c#,indent=0,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/Examples/Neo4jExamples/Program.cs[tag=verifyConnectivity,indent=0]

Console.WriteLine("Connection Verified!");
----

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the Neo4j .NET Driver and how it can be used to connect to Neo4j from within a Java application.

In the next lesson, we will take a closer look at the first argument in the `GraphDatabase.Driver()` method, the connection string.
