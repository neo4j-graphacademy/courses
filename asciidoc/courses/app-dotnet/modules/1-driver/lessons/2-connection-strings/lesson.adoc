= Connection Strings and Authentication
:type: lesson
:order: 2

In the previous lesson, you saw some example code for creating a new driver instance.
Let's take a closer look at the `Driver()` method and how it is used to create a driver instance.

----

The `GraphDatabase.Driver()` function accepts the following arguments:

1. A connection string
2. An authentication token
3. Optionally, an object containing additional driver configuration

Let's take a look at these arguments in more detail.


// == 1. Connection String

== `2` An Authentication Token

In most cases, you will connect to the DBMS using basic authentication consisting of a username and password.
You can create a basic authentication token by calling the `Basic()` method on the `AuthTokens` object.

// Neo4j also supports kerberos authentication tokens and can be extended to support custom authentication.
// These authentication methods require additional configuration and are outside of the scope of this course.

For more information on additional authentication methods, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/[Authentication and authorization^] section of the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/[Neo4j Operations Manual^].


== `3` Additional Driver Configuration (Optional)

The `Driver()` method also accepts a third additional configuration object.
The `ConfigBuilder` class provides a fluent way to provide advanced configuration options, for example setting the connection pool size or changing timeout limits.
