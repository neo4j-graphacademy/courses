== Module Overview

In this module we will provide a high-level technical overview of the Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library. This will serve as a foundation for upcoming courses that will go over graph, algorithm, and machine learning usage in more detail.

In this module, we will cover two core areas:

* *Product Overview* - How GDS is packaged, how to install it, and licensing considerations
* *How GDS Works and Configuration GDS* - GDS general workflow along with concurrency and memory configuration
