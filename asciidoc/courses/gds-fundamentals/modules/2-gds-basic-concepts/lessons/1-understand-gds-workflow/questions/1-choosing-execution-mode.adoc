= Running Multiple Algorithms

You want to test whether degree centrality or PageRank produces better results for ranking actors in your graph. You've already created an `'actors-graph'` projection.

What's the correct approach?

* [x] Run both degree centrality and PageRank on the same `'actors-graph'` projection
* [ ] Create a separate projection for each algorithm—one for degree centrality and one for PageRank
* [ ] Delete the projection after running degree centrality, then recreate it for PageRank
* [ ] You must choose one algorithm—projections can only be used for a single algorithm

====
Think about what a projection represents. Is it tied to a specific algorithm, or is it a graph structure?

.Solution
====
**Run both degree centrality and PageRank on the same `'actors-graph'` projection** is correct.

A projection is an in-memory graph structure that can be reused for multiple algorithms. Once created, you can run as many algorithms as you want on it without recreating the projection.

Creating separate projections or deleting and recreating wastes memory and time.
