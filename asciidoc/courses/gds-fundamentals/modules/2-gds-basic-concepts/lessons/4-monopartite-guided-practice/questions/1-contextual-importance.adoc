= Understanding Contextual Importance

You run degree centrality on two different monopartite projections of the same Movies dataset:

**Projection A:** Movies connected through shared actors

**Projection B:** Movies connected through shared genres

The movie "Inception" ranks highly in Projection A but poorly in Projection B.

What does this tell you about "Inception"?

* [ ] The projection calculations are incorrect—a movie should rank the same regardless of projection
* [x] "Inception" shares many actors with other movies but belongs to uncommon genre combinations
* [ ] Degree centrality is not a reliable algorithm for measuring movie importance
* [ ] "Inception" is more popular with audiences than with critics

Think about what connections each projection is measuring. What does a high degree in one projection vs. low degree in another tell you about the movie's actual relationships?

.Solution
====
**"Inception" shares many actors with other movies but belongs to uncommon genre combinations** is correct.

Centrality is contextual—it depends on the relationships in your projection.

High degree in the actor projection means "Inception" has many cast members who appear in other movies. Low degree in the genre projection means it has a unique genre combination.

Different projections answer different questions: actor networks vs. genre patterns. Neither ranking is wrong; they measure different aspects of the same movie.
