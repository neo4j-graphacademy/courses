= When to Drop Graphs

You've learned that `gds.graph.drop()` removes graphs from the catalog and frees up memory.

When would it be most appropriate to drop a graph?

* [ ] Immediately after running an algorithm, because the results are already stored
* [x] After completing your analysis when you no longer need the projection
* [ ] Before running every algorithm to ensure clean results
* [ ] Never—graphs should remain in the catalog for future reference

Think about the relationship between projections and algorithms. Can you run multiple algorithms on the same projection? Does the projection contain the algorithm results?

**After completing your analysis and no longer needing the projection.**

Graph projections are reusable—you can run multiple algorithms on the same projection without recreating it. This is one of the key benefits of GDS's Project → Run → Write workflow.

You should drop graphs when:

- You've finished all planned analyses on that projection
- You need to free up memory for new projections
- You want to recreate a projection with different configurations

Dropping graphs immediately after running algorithms would force you to recreate projections unnecessarily. Keeping every projection indefinitely could consume excessive memory.

The key is balancing reusability with memory management based on your workflow needs.
