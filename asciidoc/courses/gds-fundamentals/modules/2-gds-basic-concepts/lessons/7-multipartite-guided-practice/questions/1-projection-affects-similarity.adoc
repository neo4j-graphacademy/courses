= How Projections Affect Similarity

You ran node similarity on three different bipartite projections: User-Movie, Actor-Movie, and Movie-Genre.

Why did each projection produce different similarity results?

* [x] The projection structure determines what "similarity" means—shared ratings vs. shared cast vs. shared genres
* [ ] Node similarity uses different algorithms depending on the node types in the projection
* [ ] The three projections had different numbers of nodes, changing the algorithm's behavior
* [ ] GDS automatically adjusts similarity calculations based on the relationship types

Think about what node similarity does: it connects nodes that have shared neighbors. What are the neighbors in each projection?

**The projection structure determines what "similarity" means—shared ratings vs. shared cast vs. shared genres.**

Node similarity always does the same thing: it connects nodes on the same side of a bipartite graph based on shared neighbors on the other side.

However, what those neighbors represent changes the meaning of similarity:

- **User-Movie:** Users are similar if they rated the same movies (collaborative filtering)
- **Actor-Movie:** Actors are similar if they appeared in the same movies (collaboration patterns)
- **Movie-Genre:** Movies are similar if they belong to the same genres (content-based similarity)

The algorithm doesn't change—the analytical context does. This is why thoughtful projection design is fundamental to GDS work.
