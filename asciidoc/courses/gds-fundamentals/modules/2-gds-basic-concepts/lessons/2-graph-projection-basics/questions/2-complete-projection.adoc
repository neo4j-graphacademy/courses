= Complete the Projection

Complete the Cypher projection below to create a graph of Actors and Movies:

[source,cypher,role=noplay nocopy]
----
MATCH (source:Actor)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(target:Movie)
WITH gds.graph.project(
  'my-projection',
  /*select:source*/,
  target
) AS g
RETURN g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

* [*] source
* [ ] Actor
* [ ] :Actor
* [ ] sourceNode

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
You need to pass the Cypher variable that represents the Actor nodes.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The answer is **source**.

In `gds.graph.project()`, you pass the Cypher *variables* (not the labels) that were defined in your MATCH pattern. Since we matched `(source:Actor)`, we pass `source` to include those nodes in the projection.
