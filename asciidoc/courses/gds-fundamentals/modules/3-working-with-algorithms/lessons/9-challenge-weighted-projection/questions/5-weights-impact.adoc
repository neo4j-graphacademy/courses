= Interpreting Similarity Scores

What does a similarity score of 0.85 between two users indicate?

* [ ] They rated exactly 85% of the same movies
* [x] They have highly overlapping rating patterns with similar preferences
* [ ] One user copied 85% of the other user's ratings
* [ ] They are in the same community with 85% certainty

**They have highly overlapping rating patterns with similar preferences.**

Similarity scores in Node Similarity represent how "alike" two nodes are based on their connections. A score of **0.85** is high and indicates:

**What it means:**

- The users rated many of the same movies
- When weights are used, they gave similar ratings (both liked or both disliked)
- Their taste profiles are very compatible
- Recommendations based on one user's ratings would likely work well for the other

**Score interpretation:**

- **0.9-1.0**: Nearly identical preferences (rare)
- **0.7-0.9**: Very similar, strong match for recommendations
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderately similar, some overlap
- **0.3-0.5**: Weakly similar, little overlap
- **< 0.3**: Very different preferences

**In practice:**

For recommendation systems, you typically:

- Use scores > 0.7 for confident recommendations
- Use scores 0.5-0.7 for "you might also like" suggestions
- Ignore scores < 0.5 as too dissimilar

The exact score depends on the similarity metric used (Jaccard, overlap, etc.), but higher always means more similar.
