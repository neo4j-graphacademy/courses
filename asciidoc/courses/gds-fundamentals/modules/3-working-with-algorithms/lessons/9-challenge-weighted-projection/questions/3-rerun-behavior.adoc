= How Do Weights Affect Node Similarity?

How does using `relationshipWeightProperty: 'rating'` affect the Node Similarity calculation in a user-movie graph?

* [ ] It makes the algorithm run faster
* [ ] It filters out low-rated movies before calculating similarity
* [x] It gives more importance to movies with higher ratings when computing similarity scores
* [ ] It only compares users who rated at least 5 movies

Think about two users who both rated the same movies—one gave 5 stars, the other gave 2 stars. Should they be considered similar?

**It gives more importance to movies with higher ratings when computing similarity scores.**

Without weights, Node Similarity only considers **which** movies users rated in common—not **how** they rated them.

**With `relationshipWeightProperty: 'rating'`:**

- Movies with higher ratings (4-5 stars) contribute more to similarity
- If two users both love the same movies (high ratings), they're more similar
- If two users both disliked the same movies (low ratings), they're still somewhat similar
- If one user loved a movie (5 stars) and another hated it (1 star), they're less similar

**Example:**

- **User A** rates: Movie1=5, Movie2=5, Movie3=5
- **User B** rates: Movie1=5, Movie2=5, Movie3=2
- **User C** rates: Movie1=2, Movie2=3, Movie3=1

Users A and B are more similar (they both loved Movies 1 and 2) than A and C (who rated the same movies very differently).

This weighted approach is essential for recommendation systems—you want to recommend based on similar **preferences**, not just similar **viewing history**.
