= Why Does Label Propagation Produce Different Results?

Why does Label Propagation produce different results each time you run it?

* [ ] The algorithm uses random initialization and has no convergence criteria
* [x] The algorithm's reliance on neighbor voting and tie-breaking introduces randomness
* [ ] The graph structure changes between runs
* [ ] GDS has a bug in the Label Propagation implementation

====
Think about what happens when a node's neighbors are evenly split between two community labels. How does the algorithm decide which label to adopt?

.Solution
====
**The algorithm's reliance on neighbor voting and tie-breaking introduces randomness.**

Label Propagation is non-deterministic because:

**Tie-breaking:**
When a node's neighbors have equal votes for multiple labels (e.g., 3 neighbors in community A, 3 in community B), the algorithm must break the tie. This tie-breaking is random, leading to different outcomes.

**Update order:**
The sequence in which nodes update their labels can affect the final result. If node X updates before node Y, it might influence Y's decision differently than if Y updated first.

**Cascading effects:**
A single tie-break early in the algorithm can cascade through the network, causing different nodes to join different communities as the labels propagate.

This is a known trade-off: Label Propagation is fast and simple, but less stable than modularity-optimizing algorithms like Louvain or Leiden, which are deterministic (same input = same output).
