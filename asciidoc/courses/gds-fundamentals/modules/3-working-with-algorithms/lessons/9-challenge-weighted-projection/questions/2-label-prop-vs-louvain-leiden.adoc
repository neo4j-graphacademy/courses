= Label Propagation vs. Louvain/Leiden

How is Label Propagation fundamentally different from Louvain and Leiden?

* [x] Label Propagation uses local neighbor voting, while Louvain/Leiden optimize modularity globally
* [ ] Label Propagation only works on weighted graphs, while Louvain/Leiden work on unweighted graphs
* [ ] Label Propagation is slower than Louvain/Leiden
* [ ] Label Propagation can only detect overlapping communities

.Solution
====
**Label Propagation uses local neighbor voting, while Louvain/Leiden optimize modularity globally.**

**Label Propagation:**
- Uses a simple voting mechanism: each node adopts the most common label among its neighbors
- Makes local decisions based only on immediate connections
- Fast and simple, but results can be sensitive to initialization

**Louvain/Leiden:**
- Optimize modularity—a global metric measuring how well-defined communities are
- Consider the entire network structure when making decisions
- Hierarchical: they aggregate communities into super-nodes and repeat
- Generally more stable and produce higher-quality communities

Both detect communities, but through fundamentally different approaches—local voting vs. global optimization.
