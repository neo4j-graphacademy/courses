= Stream vs. Mutate Mode

What is the key difference between using Node Similarity in stream mode versus mutate mode?

* [x] Stream returns results for analysis; mutate creates relationships in the in-memory projection
* [ ] Stream is faster than mutate mode
* [ ] Stream can use weights; mutate cannot
* [ ] Stream finds more similar pairs than mutate

Think about what happens to the similarity results in each mode—where do they go?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Stream returns results for analysis; mutate creates relationships in the in-memory projection.**

**Stream mode (`gds.nodeSimilarity.stream`):**

- Returns similarity pairs as query results
- Use for analysis, reporting, or further Cypher processing
- Does not modify the projection or database
- Perfect for exploration and one-time analysis

**Mutate mode (`gds.nodeSimilarity.mutate`):**

- Creates new `SIMILAR` relationships in the in-memory projection
- Use when you want to run additional algorithms on the similarity network
- Allows chaining algorithms (e.g., similarity → community detection)
- Still doesn't touch the database

**Write mode** does the same as mutate but persists relationships to the database.

In this challenge, you used **stream mode** because you only needed to analyze similarity pairs, not create a similarity network for further algorithms.
