= What Does Label Propagation Do?

What is the primary purpose of Label Propagation?

* [ ] It assigns importance scores to nodes based on their connections
* [x] It detects communities by having nodes adopt the most common label among their neighbors
* [ ] It finds the shortest path between two nodes
* [ ] It calculates centrality scores for all nodes

Think about what "propagating labels" means—how do nodes decide which community they belong to?

.Solution
====
**Label Propagation detects communities by having nodes adopt the most common label among their neighbors.**

The algorithm works iteratively:
1. Each node starts with its own unique label (community ID)
2. In each iteration, nodes adopt the label that appears most frequently among their neighbors
3. This continues until labels stabilize or a maximum iteration count is reached

Labels "propagate" through the network as neighbors influence each other, naturally forming communities of nodes that are densely connected.
