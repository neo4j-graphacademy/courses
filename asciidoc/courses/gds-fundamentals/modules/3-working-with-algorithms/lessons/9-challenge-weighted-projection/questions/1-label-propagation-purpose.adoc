= What Does Node Similarity Do?

What is the primary purpose of the Node Similarity algorithm?

* [ ] It finds the shortest path between similar nodes
* [x] It computes similarity scores between nodes based on their shared neighbors
* [ ] It detects communities by grouping similar nodes together
* [ ] It ranks nodes by their importance in the network

**Node Similarity computes similarity scores between nodes based on their shared neighbors.**

The algorithm works by:

. Comparing each node to others in the graph
. Counting how many neighbors they have in common
. Calculating a similarity score (typically Jaccard similarity or overlap coefficient)
. Optionally filtering to keep only the most similar pairs (using `topK`)

In a user-movie bipartite graph, users are similar if they rated many of the same movies. When using `relationshipWeightProperty`, the algorithm considers rating values when calculating similarity—users who gave similar ratings to the same movies are more similar.
