= When is gds.util.asNode() Not Needed?

In which execution modes would you **not** need to use `gds.util.asNode()`?

* [ ] stream—because you need to access node properties in results
* [x] estimate—because you're checking memory requirements
* [x] write—because results are persisted as node properties, not returned
* [ ] All modes require gds.util.asNode() to work properly

Think about which modes return individual node results vs. which modes operate differently.

**write—because results are persisted as node properties, not returned.**

`gds.util.asNode()` is only needed when you're working with `nodeId` values in query results—specifically in **stream mode**.

In **write mode**, algorithm results are written directly to your database as node properties. You don't get individual node IDs back to convert—instead, you query your graph normally:

```cypher
// Write mode persists scores to the database
CALL gds.pageRank.write('my-graph', {writeProperty: 'pagerank'})

// Later, query normally—no gds.util.asNode() needed
MATCH (a:Actor)
RETURN a.name, a.pagerank
ORDER BY a.pagerank DESC
```

Similarly, **stats mode** returns aggregate statistics (not individual nodes), and **mutate mode** stores results in the projection (not returned for display).

**Estimate mode** doesn't run the algorithm at all, so there are no results to convert.

Only **stream mode** returns individual `nodeId` values that need conversion for human-readable output.
