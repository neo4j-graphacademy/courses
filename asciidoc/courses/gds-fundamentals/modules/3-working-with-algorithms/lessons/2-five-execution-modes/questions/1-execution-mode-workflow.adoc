= Choosing the Right Execution Mode

You want to run PageRank to find influential actors, then use those PageRank scores as input to another algorithm without writing anything to your database yet.

Which execution mode should you use for the PageRank step?

* [ ] stats—to see summary statistics of PageRank scores
* [ ] stream—to view PageRank results without storing them
* [x] mutate—to store scores in the projection for the next algorithm
* [ ] write—to persist scores to the database

====
The key requirement is that another algorithm needs to use the PageRank scores. Where do algorithm results need to be stored for other algorithms to access them?

**mutate—to store scores in the projection for the next algorithm.**

Mutate mode stores algorithm results as node properties in the in-memory projection. This allows subsequent algorithms to use those properties as inputs—exactly what you need for algorithm chaining.

Stream mode would show you the results but not store them anywhere for the next algorithm to use.

Write mode would persist results to the database, which is unnecessary if you're still building your workflow and don't want intermediate results cluttering your graph.

Stats mode would only show you summary information, not individual scores needed for chaining.

Mutate is perfect for workflows where you're building compound insights by chaining multiple algorithms before writing final results.
