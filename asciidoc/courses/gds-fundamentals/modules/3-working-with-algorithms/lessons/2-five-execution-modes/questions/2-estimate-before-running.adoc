= Understanding estimate mode

Why would you run a GDS algorithm in estimate mode before running it in another mode?

* [ ] Estimate mode is required before you can use stream, mutate, or write
* [ ] Estimate mode runs faster and gives you approximate results
* [x] Estimate mode tells you how much memory the algorithm will need
* [ ] Estimate mode validates your projection before running the algorithm

Think about what "estimate" means and why you'd want to know something before committing to a full algorithm run.

**Estimate mode tells you how much memory the algorithm will need.**

Estimate mode calculates memory requirements without actually running the algorithm. This helps you:

- Plan your workflow by understanding resource needs
- Avoid out-of-memory errors on large graphs
- Compare memory requirements of different algorithms or configurations
- Decide if you need to adjust your projection or move to a larger instance

Estimate is not required before running algorithms—it's optional but recommended for planning purposes.

It doesn't give you approximate results (it doesn't run the algorithm at all), and it doesn't validate your projection (you can run algorithms on any valid projection).

Running estimate first is a best practice for production workflows where you need to manage memory carefully across multiple analyses.
