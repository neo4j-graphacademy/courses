= Understanding algorithm context

The lesson stated that "an algorithm's output is only as important as the data model it analyzes."

When you ran Degree Centrality on the actor collaboration network, Bruce Willis ranked highly. What does this result actually tell you?

* [ ] Bruce Willis is the most important actor in general
* [x] Bruce Willis has collaborated with many different actors
* [ ] Bruce Willis appears in the highest-rated movies
* [ ] Bruce Willis connects different communities of actors

**Bruce Willis has collaborated with many different actors.**

Degree Centrality counts direct connections. In the actor collaboration network, each connection represents working with another actor on shared movies.

A high degree score means Bruce Willis has worked with many different co-stars—making him a prolific collaborator, not necessarily the "most important" actor by other measures.

This illustrates a key principle: algorithm results must be interpreted in the context of your data model. The same algorithm on different projections answers different questions.

Degree Centrality doesn't measure movie ratings, community bridging (that would be Betweenness Centrality), or general importance—it measures direct connection count in whatever network you've projected.
