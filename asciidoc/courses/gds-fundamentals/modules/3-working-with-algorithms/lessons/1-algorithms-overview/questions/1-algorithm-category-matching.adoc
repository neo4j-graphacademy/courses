[.question]
= Matching algorithms to questions

You want to identify groups of users who have similar movie-watching behaviors so you can recommend movies within each group.

Which algorithm category best answers this question?

* [ ] Centrality—to find the most important users
* [x] Community Detection—to find natural groups of users with similar behaviors
* [ ] Pathfinding—to find connections between users
* [ ] Similarity—to find individual user pairs with similar patterns

====
The question asks about "groups" of users, not individual pairs or importance rankings. Which category finds natural clusters?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Community Detection—to find natural groups of users with similar behaviors.**

Community detection algorithms like Louvain or Leiden find natural clusters in your network where nodes are more connected to each other than to the rest of the network.

In a user-movie network, community detection would group users who rate similar movies into communities, revealing behavioral segments perfect for group-based recommendations.

While Similarity algorithms can find individual user pairs with similar patterns, Community Detection reveals the overall group structure—which is what the question asks for.

Centrality would tell you which users are most connected or influential, and Pathfinding would show routes through the network, but neither identifies natural groupings.
