= Understanding algorithm attributes

In the GDS documentation, you see an algorithm has a green checkmark for "Undirected" but a gray checkmark for "Weighted."

What does this tell you?

* [ ] The algorithm only works on undirected graphs and will fail on weighted graphs
* [x] The algorithm supports undirected relationships and ignores relationship weights
* [ ] You must configure the algorithm to use undirected mode, and weights are optional
* [ ] The algorithm requires undirected graphs but prohibits weighted relationships

Think about what green (supported), gray (not applicable), and red (not supported) mean for algorithm capabilities.

.Solution

**The algorithm supports undirected relationships and ignores relationship weights.**

The attribute table in GDS documentation uses three indicators:

- **Green checkmark**: The algorithm supports this feature
- **Gray**: The feature isn't applicable to this algorithm type  
- **Red cross**: The algorithm doesn't support this feature

A green checkmark for "Undirected" means the algorithm can work with undirected relationships (or can treat directed relationships as undirected with configuration).

A red cross for "Weighted" means the algorithm doesn't use relationship weights even if they exist in your projection—it treats all relationships equally.

This doesn't mean the algorithm will fail on weighted graphs—it just means it won't use the weights in its calculations.

Understanding these attributes helps you choose the right algorithm for your data structure and avoid expecting functionality that isn't supported.
