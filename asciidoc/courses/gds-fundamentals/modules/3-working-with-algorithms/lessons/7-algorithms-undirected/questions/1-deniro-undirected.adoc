Where is Robert De Niro at `dampingFactor: 0.15`?

* [ ] Position 1
* [ ] Position 5
* [x] Not in the top 10
* [ ] Position 10

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Robert De Niro is **not in the top 10** at `dampingFactor: 0.15`.

With a low `dampingFactor`, PageRank essentially becomes a connection count algorithm. Actors with many collaborations dominate—regardless of who they worked with.

Robert De Niro has fewer total collaborations than actors like Jackie Chan (153 films), so he drops out of the top 10 when we only count quantity.

But watch what happens as you increase `dampingFactor`:

- **0.50**: Robert De Niro appears at position 5
- **0.60**: Robert De Niro climbs to position 3
- **0.85**: Robert De Niro reaches position 1

As `dampingFactor` increases, PageRank weighs connection *quality* more heavily. Robert De Niro worked with highly influential actors, so he rises to the top when quality matters more than quantity.
