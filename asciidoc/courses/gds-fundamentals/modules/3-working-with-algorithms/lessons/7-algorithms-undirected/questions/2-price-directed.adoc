= Spot Vincent Price: Directed Graph

Run PageRank on `actor-network-directed` with these dampingFactor values: 0.15, 0.50, 0.85

Where is Vincent Price at `dampingFactor: 0.85`?

* [ ] Position 1
* [ ] Position 6
* [x] Not in the top 10
* [ ] Position 5

.Hint
====
High `dampingFactor` values emphasize connection quality over connection count.

.Solution

Vincent Price is **not in the top 10** at `dampingFactor: 0.85`.

This is the opposite pattern from Robert De Niro on the undirected graph:

- **0.15**: Vincent Price is at position 1
- **0.50**: Vincent Price drops to position 6
- **0.85**: Vincent Price falls out of the top 10

At low `dampingFactor`, Vincent Price ranks #1 because he has many collaborations. But as `dampingFactor` increases and connection quality becomes more important, he drops out entirely.

This suggests Vincent Price, while prolific, didn't work with as many highly-connected actors as Robert De Niro did. When the algorithm prioritizes "who you know" over "how many you know," different actors rise to prominence.

**Key insight:** The same algorithm with different configuration can reveal different dimensions of importance in your network—quantity vs. quality, breadth vs. depth.
