= Relationship traversal efficiency

Why are graph databases more efficient for relationship traversal?

* Graph databases have larger storage capacity than tabular databases
* [x] Graph databases don't require joins or table reformatting to access relationships
* Tabular databases cannot store relationship data at all
* Graph databases are faster at storing individual properties

.Hint
====
Think about what you need to do in a tabular database to find connections between entities.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
Graph databases store relationships with the same importance as entities, allowing direct traversal without joins or table reformatting. Tabular databases require explicit joins or reshaping to access relationships, which is neither fast nor computationally efficient.
