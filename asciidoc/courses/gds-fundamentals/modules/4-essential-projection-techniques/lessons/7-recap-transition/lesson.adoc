== Congratulations!

You've completed **Getting Started with Graph Data Science**.

You've built a strong foundation in GDS that will enable you to apply graph algorithms to solve complex analytical problems.


== What you've learned

In this course, you learned:

* **What graph data science is:** How GDS extends graph databases with analytical algorithms to find patterns, communities, and insights invisible to traditional data science

* **The GDS workflow:** The Project → Run → Write pattern that underlies all GDS work

* **Graph projections:** How to create monopartite, bipartite, and multipartite projections tailored to specific analytical questions

* **Graph catalog operations:** How to list, validate, and manage projected graphs in memory

* **Algorithm categories:** The five main categories (Centrality, Community Detection, Pathfinding, Similarity, Embeddings) and when to use each

* **Algorithm execution modes:** How to use stats, stream, mutate, write, and estimate modes for different workflow needs

* **Working with results:** How to use `gds.util.asNode()` and related functions to access node properties from algorithm outputs

* **Reading GDS documentation:** How to independently learn any GDS algorithm by understanding syntax, configuration, and attributes

* **Algorithm configuration:** How to customize algorithms with orientation (directed/undirected), weights, and algorithm-specific parameters

* **Relationship aggregation:** How to collapse multiple relationships into weighted connections using `count(r)` during projection

* **Projection modeling:** How to design projections based on analytical questions, matching algorithm assumptions to graph structure


== The skills you have

You can now:

- Understand what graph data science is and how it differs from traditional analytics
- Create graph projections tailored to specific analytical questions
- Manage graphs in the GDS catalog (list, validate, drop)
- Choose appropriate algorithms for centrality, community, pathfinding, similarity, and embedding analyses
- Run algorithms in different execution modes based on workflow needs
- Configure algorithms with orientation, weights, and custom parameters
- Read and understand GDS documentation independently
- Access and interpret algorithm results using utility functions
- Design projections that match algorithm requirements


== Continue your learning
