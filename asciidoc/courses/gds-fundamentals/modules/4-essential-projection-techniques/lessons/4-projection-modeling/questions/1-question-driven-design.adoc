= Using questions to drive projection design

You're asked: "Which actors are most influential in Hollywood based on their collaboration network?"

Which projection design best answers this question?

* [x] Monopartite: Actor -> Actor (through shared movies) with PageRank or Betweenness
* [ ] Bipartite: Actor -> Movie with Node Similarity
* [ ] Bipartite: Actor -> Movie with Degree Centrality
* [ ] Monopartite: Movie -> Movie with Community Detection

The question asks about actors and influence. What node type needs to be in your results? What type of algorithms measure influence?

**Monopartite: Actor -> Actor (through shared movies) with PageRank or Betweenness.**

When designing projections, start with your analytical question:

**Question analysis:**

- **Who needs to be in the answer?** Actors only
- **What are you measuring?** Influence
- **What defines the relationship?** Collaboration through shared movies

**Projection design:**

Since only actors need to be in the results, use a **monopartite** Actor -> Actor projection. You don't need Movie nodes in the final analysis—they're just the mechanism for creating actor connections.

**Algorithm selection:**

"Influence" suggests **centrality** algorithms:

- PageRank: Measures influence through connections to influential actors
- Betweenness: Identifies actors who bridge different collaboration groups

**Why other options don't work:**

- Bipartite Actor -> Movie projections would give you actor-movie similarity, not actor influence
- Movie -> Movie projections would analyze movies, not actors
- Community Detection finds groups, not influence rankings

The key skill is: question → node types in answer → projection structure → algorithm category.
