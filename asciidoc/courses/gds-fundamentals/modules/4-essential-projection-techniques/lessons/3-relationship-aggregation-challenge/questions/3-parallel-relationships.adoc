= Parallel Relationships Without Aggregation

If you projected the director-actor collaboration network **without** aggregating (just using the MATCH pattern without `count(r)`), what would happen?

* [ ] The projection would fail because GDS requires aggregation
* [x] You'd have multiple parallel relationships between the same director-actor pairs
* [ ] GDS would automatically aggregate them for you
* [ ] Each director-actor pair would have exactly one relationship

====
Consider what happens when a director and actor collaborate on multiple movies. How many times would that pattern match?

.Solution
====
**You'd have multiple parallel relationships between the same director-actor pairs.**

Without aggregation, the pattern `(d:Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Actor)` would match once for **each shared movie**.

If Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale worked on 3 films together, you'd project 3 separate relationships between them in the graph. GDS doesn't automatically merge these—you need explicit aggregation with `count(r)` to collapse them into a single weighted relationship.
