= What Does count(r) Aggregate?

In your projection pattern:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (d:Director)-[r:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Actor)
WITH d, a, count(r) AS rels
----

What is `count(r)` actually counting?

* [ ] The number of Actor nodes
* [ ] The number of Director nodes
* [x] The number of shared Movie nodes between each director-actor pair
* [ ] The total number of relationships in the database

====
Think about what the relationship variable `r` represents in the MATCH pattern, and what happens when you group by `d` and `a`.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**The number of shared Movie nodes between each director-actor pair.**

The `r` variable represents the `DIRECTED` relationship from director to movie. When you use `WITH d, a, count(r)`, you're grouping by each unique director-actor pair and counting how many movies they share.

If a director and actor collaborated on 4 movies, `count(r)` returns `4`, representing the 4 `DIRECTED` relationships (one per movie) in that pattern.
