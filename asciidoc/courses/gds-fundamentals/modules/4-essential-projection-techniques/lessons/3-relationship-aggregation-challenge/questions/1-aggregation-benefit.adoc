= Why Aggregate Relationships?

You aggregated multiple director-actor collaborations (via shared movies) into single weighted relationships.

What is the primary benefit of this aggregation?

* [ ] It makes the projection queries simpler to write
* [x] It reduces graph size while preserving connection strength information
* [ ] It automatically makes all algorithms run faster
* [ ] It's required for all GDS algorithms

====
Consider what happens to the number of relationships in your projection when you aggregate, and what information the weight property captures.

.Solution
====
**It reduces graph size while preserving connection strength information.**

Without aggregation, each shared movie creates a separate relationship between a director and actor. If they worked together on 5 movies, you'd have 5 parallel relationships in your projection.

With aggregation, those 5 relationships collapse into a single relationship with `rels: 5`. This:

- **Reduces memory usage**: Fewer relationships means smaller graph footprint
- **Improves algorithm performance**: Algorithms traverse fewer edges
- **Preserves meaning**: The `rels` property captures collaboration frequency, which algorithms can use

The `rels` property represents the **strength** of the director-actor relationship. Algorithms that support weighted relationships will prioritize stronger collaborations when forming communities or calculating centrality.
