= Monopartite vs. Bipartite for Influence

If you chose to project a **monopartite** Director -> Director graph (directors connected through shared actors), what does each relationship represent?

* [ ] The number of movies two directors have both directed
* [x] That two directors have worked with at least one common actor
* [ ] That two directors have the same level of influence
* [ ] A direct collaboration between two directors

====
Think about the pattern you're matching: `(Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(Director)`

What connects the two directors in this pattern?

.Solution
====
**That two directors have worked with at least one common actor.**

In a monopartite projection, you're creating *inferred relationships* between directors based on shared actors. If Christopher Nolan and Ridley Scott have both worked with the same actor, they get connected in the projection—even though they never directly collaborated.

This is useful for measuring influence because directors in the same "network" of actors might have similar styles, access to similar talent pools, or be competing for the same actors.
