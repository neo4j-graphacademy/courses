= Matching Projections to Questions

You're asked: **"Which directors tend to work in the same circles?"**

Which of the following projection designs best answers this question?

* [ ] Bipartite: Director -> Movie
* [x] Monopartite: Director -> Director
* [ ] Multipartite: Actor -> Movie -> Director
* [ ] Multipartite: Director -> Movie -> Actor -> Genre

The question is about directors who work in similar circles. Does knowing their movies tell you anything about whether they worked with the same people? What relationship structure would capture "working in similar groups"?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
**Monopartite: Director -> Director.**

The question asks about directors working in the same *circles*, which means you want Director -> Director relationships in your projection. You don't need Movie or Actor nodes in the final output, but you use them to *create* the director connections.

Community detection algorithms (like Louvain or Leiden) would cluster directors who work with the same actors, revealing groups of directors who operate in similar creative circles or talent pools.

The bipartite option (Director -> Movie) doesn't capture the concept of "circles"—it only shows which directors worked on which films, not which directors are connected through shared talent.
