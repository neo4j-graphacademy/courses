= Course summary

Congratulations on completing **Getting Started with Graph Data Science**!

You've built a strong foundation in GDS that will enable you to apply graph algorithms to solve complex analytical problems.


== What you've learned

In this course, you learned:

* **What graph data science is:** How GDS extends graph databases with analytical algorithms to find patterns, communities, and insights invisible to traditional data science

* **The GDS workflow:** The Project → Run → Write pattern that underlies all GDS work

* **Graph projections:** How to create monopartite, bipartite, and multipartite projections tailored to specific analytical questions

* **Graph catalog operations:** How to list, validate, and manage projected graphs in memory

* **Algorithm categories:** The five main categories (Centrality, Community Detection, Pathfinding, Similarity, Embeddings) and when to use each

* **Algorithm execution modes:** How to use stats, stream, mutate, write, and estimate modes for different workflow needs

* **Working with results:** How to use `gds.util.asNode()` and related functions to access node properties from algorithm outputs

* **Reading GDS documentation:** How to independently learn any GDS algorithm by understanding syntax, configuration, and attributes

* **Algorithm configuration:** How to customize algorithms with orientation (directed/undirected), weights, and algorithm-specific parameters

* **Relationship aggregation:** How to collapse multiple relationships into weighted connections using `count(r)` during projection

* **Projection modeling:** How to design projections based on analytical questions, matching algorithm assumptions to graph structure


== The skills you have

You can now:

- Understand what graph data science is and how it differs from traditional analytics
- Create graph projections tailored to specific analytical questions
- Manage graphs in the GDS catalog (list, validate, drop)
- Choose appropriate algorithms for centrality, community, pathfinding, similarity, and embedding analyses
- Run algorithms in different execution modes based on workflow needs
- Configure algorithms with orientation, weights, and custom parameters
- Read and understand GDS documentation independently
- Access and interpret algorithm results using utility functions
- Design projections that match algorithm requirements


== What we didn't cover

This course focused on GDS fundamentals to get you productive quickly. There are plenty more topics to cover--in future courses, you will learn:

**Advanced projection patterns:**

- **Single-source projections with OPTIONAL MATCH:** For including isolated nodes or controlling node sets independently from relationships
- **Multi-hop projections:** Creating relationships that span multiple steps in your graph

**Advanced algorithm topics:**

- **Node and relationship filtering:** Using `nodeProperties` and `relationshipProperties` to subset projections
- **Seeding algorithms:** Pre-configuring community detection or PageRank with existing values
- **Memory estimation strategies:** Detailed planning for large-scale graph projections
- **Pipeline workflows:** Chaining multiple algorithms together in sequence

**Production considerations:**

- **Performance tuning:** Optimizing projections and algorithms for large graphs
- **Result persistence strategies:** When to use mutate vs. write vs. stream
- **GDS in production applications:** Integrating GDS into data pipelines

If you encounter these scenarios, the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[GDS documentation^] provides detailed coverage. The fundamentals you've learned here give you the foundation to understand these advanced patterns when you need them.


== Continue your learning

Ready to apply these fundamentals to real-world problems?

Continue your journey with link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/gds-applied-algorithms/[**Applied Algorithms in GDS**^], where you'll see these techniques solve actual industry challenges:

* **Manufacturing optimization:** Root cause analysis using centrality and community detection
* **Fraud detection:** Network-based fraud identification with graph patterns
* **Supply chain logistics:** Route optimization with pathfinding algorithms
* **Citation networks:** Research influence mapping and analysis
* **Node embeddings:** Structural similarity and machine learning workflows

Each module demonstrates not just *how* to run algorithms, but *when* and *why* professionals choose specific approaches to solve complex problems.
