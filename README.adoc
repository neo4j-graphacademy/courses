= GraphAcademy Course Content

This repository holds the course curriculum for link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com[GraphAcademy^].


== Prerequisites

You will need the following software to run GraphAcademy locally:

* link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker^]
* link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI^]
* link:https://nodejs.org/en/download[Node.js^]
* link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git]

Recommended:

* link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[VS Code^]
  * Asciidoc extension

== Setup

This repository uses link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[`docker-compose`] to create a local server using the latest production build of the GraphAcademy website (link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/website/[repo here^]).  The docker image is stored on AWS ECR, so you will need credentials - talk to mailto:adam@neo4j.com[Adam].

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI^]
3. Run `aws configure` to configure the AWS CLI
4. Log in to docker using the credentials above:

    aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login -u AWS --password-stdin 715633473519.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

5. Install the dependencies using NPM

    npm install

6. You will need to create a `.env` file in the project root with Auth0 configuration.  You can get an example file from mailto:adam@neo4j.com[Adam] or mailto:martin.ohanlon@neo4j.com[Martin].
    * `NEO4J_HOST`
    * `NEO4J_USERNAME`
    * `NEO4J_PASSWORD`
    * `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
    * `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`
    * `AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL`
    * `CDN_URL`

7. Run `npm run dev` to start the server

  * The local server will be available at http://localhost:3000 +
  * A Neo4j instance will be available on http://localhost:7474 +
  * A process will listen for changes in the `asciidoc/` folder and sync the content to Neo4j

=== Devcontainer

If you are using VS Code, you can use the devcontainer to run the application in a container.

You will need the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers[Dev Containers^] extension installed and link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker^] running.

When the devcontainer is started, it will:

* Install all dependencies
* Start the GraphAcademy application and Neo4j database.

You can run the content update and sync by running the following command in a terminal:

[source,sh]
npm run dev:watch

== File Structure

All content lives in the `asciidoc/` directory.  As you modify the content, a process will sync the course structure to Neo4j.

* `categories/` - Category information
* `courses/` - All courses are organised into the own folder structure with modules and lessons
* `emails/` - The emails sent to users on enrolment, completion and a reminder email when the user has been inactive for 7 days
* `languages/` - i18n phrases for courses in languages other than English.
* `pages/` - "CMS" content displayed throughout the website, for example the `/certifications/` page
* `shared/` - Content shared across courses
* `statuses/` - Meta data around course statuses

== Workshops

Workshops are instructor-led courses that are designed to be delivered in a classroom setting.  They should not be used for self-study.  The following workshops are available:

* **Introduction to Graph Databases Workshop** (`workshop-fundamentals`) - Learn about Graph theory, Neo4j fundamentals, and how to read and write data using Cypher. +

== QA

A suite of tests have been setup to ensure courses meet the right standard.

To open the test suite run:

[source,sh]
npm run test

This will open up a UI.  Select E2E testing > Chrome and then select the course.

To create a test for your course, you can copy one of the existing files in the `cypress/e2e` folder to `cypress/e2e/{slug}.cy.js` and then change line 6 to `cy.getCourseDetails('{slug}')`/


== Contributing

To create a new course or modify an existing course, please create a new branch and make your changes.
Once you have finished, create a new PR and add `adam-cowley` as a reviewer.

  git checkout -b new-course
  mkdir asciidoc/courses/new-course/
  echo "= New Course\n:status: draft" > asciidoc/courses/new-course/course.adoc

  git add asciidoc/courses/new-course/
  git commit -m "Added new course"
  git push --set-upstream origin new-course

Before creating the PR, please rebase your branch on the main branch.

  git fetch origin main
  git rebase main


=== Generating a Banner

To generate a banner image for a course, run the following command:

[source]
npm run generate:ogimages

The command scans through the `asciidoc/` folder, finds all courses that don't include a `banner.png` image and attempts to create them.

== Deploying Changes

When a new application server is created, the latest tagged version of this repository is downloaded by the server.

You can use the `npm version` command to create a new tag.  First, run a `git pull --tags` to get the latest commits and tags from the server, then run the `npm version` command to create a new tag.  Once you are done, run `git push --tags`.

  git pull --tags origin main
  npm version patch
  git push --tags origin main


* `npm version patch` - To be used when minor fixes are made to an existing course
* `npm version minor` - To be used when a new course is released
* `npm version major` - To be used when a major change is made to the repository - for example, multiple course changes, or addition of a new category

== Linking Certifications

To link certifications from the certifications repository, create a symlink: 

[source,sh]
ln -s ../certifications/asciidoc/certifications/neo4j-certification asciidoc/certifications/neo4j-certification

== Documentation

Additional documentation is located in the link:docs/[Docs folder].
