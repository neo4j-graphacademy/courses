.Solution
====
**1 minute** is correct.

A 1-minute scrape interval provides good visibility into metric trends while minimizing load on both Prometheus and the Aura metrics API. This interval works well for most standard monitoring scenarios.

**5 seconds** - Too frequent and creates unnecessary load. **15 seconds** - Better for real-time monitoring than standard needs. **10 minutes** - Too infrequent for most monitoring requirements.
