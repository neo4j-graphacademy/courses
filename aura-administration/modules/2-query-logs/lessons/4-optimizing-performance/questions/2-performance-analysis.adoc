What does high planning time (above 100ms) in query logs typically indicate?

* [ ] The query needs an index
* [ ] The query returns too much data
* [x] The query is not parameterized
* [ ] The query has too many page faults

.Hint
====
Planning time relates to how the query execution plan is prepared and cached.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is **The query is not parameterized**.

High planning time indicates that Neo4j must generate a new execution plan for each query execution. Non-parameterized queries with literal values cannot reuse cached plans, forcing the planner to work harder.

**The query needs an index** affects execution time and page faults, not planning time. **The query returns too much data** impacts duration and memory, not planning. **The query has too many page faults** relates to cache misses during execution, not the planning phase.
