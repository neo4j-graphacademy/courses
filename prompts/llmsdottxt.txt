A valid llms.txt file should be structured as follows:

* An H1 title with the name of the project or site.
* A blockquote summarizing the project with key details.
* Additional markdown sections providing more context about the project.
* Sections (H2 headers) listing relevant files with markdown links and optional descriptions.
* An optional section for lower-priority resources.

An example of a good llms.txt file:

```
# ExampleApp

## Documentation

### Getting started

#### Introduction

### ai-tools Implementation

# Using AI to build ExampleApp apps

AI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), can accelerate your development with ExampleApp. Searching docs, responding to questions and even helping you write code are all things that LLMs are starting to get good at.

However, ExampleApp is a rapidly evolving framework, so sometimes AI might get things a little wrong.

To help the LLMs, we provide the ExampleApp documentation in a txt file that is optimized for use with AI tools, like Cursor.

## Setting up AI tools

Every tool is different, but generally, you'll need to either paste the contents of the [llms-full.txt](https://example.com/llms-full.txt) file directly in your prompt, or attach the file to the tool.

### ChatGPT and v0

Upload the txt file in your prompt.
